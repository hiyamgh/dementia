"Target garnered intense criticism for a Christmas sweater that seemingly mocked people who suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder. The store received backlash from customers who felt the sweater, which had the phrase ?Obsessive Christmas Disorder? written on the front, belittled and mocked a serious mental disorder. ?As someone with OCDI really appreciate it if youdidn sell my illness as a fashion statement,? Twitter user Reign Murphy tweeted alongside a photo of her holding up the sweater. Others reacted similarly to the controversy, with several blasting the retail giant for mocking a ?serious mental illness.? ""Today at Target I saw a sweater that said 'OCD Obsessive Christmas Disorder'?why is trivializing a mental disorder so widely accepted?? one tweet about the sweater read. Target ultimately responded to the backlash with an apology, but stopped short of removing the item from its stores. ?We never want to disappoint our guests and we apologize for any discomfort. We currently do not have plans to remove this sweater,? spokesman Josh Thomas said in the statement. Target was previously the center of similar controversy regarding a sign that referenced ?building sets? and girlsbuilding sets? for sale. It was also criticized for selling a women's T-shirt with the word Trophyon the front, which inspired a successful petition for its removal. ?The truth is that millions of women and young girls are taken as trophiesevery year in war, sex trafficking, slavery, and rape,? the petition said, Fortune reported. ?Labeling any person as a Trophyis demeaning their humanity and objectifying them as a tangible object that can be bought, used, and disposed of.? Target responded to that controversy by apologizing for offending customers. ?It is never our intention to offend anyone,? thecompany statement read. ?These shirts are intended as a fun wink and we have received an overwhelmingly positive response from our guests.?",0.026431717999999996,0.0,0.0,0.004405286,0.039647577,0.295154185,0.0,2,-1,1
"In 2011, St. Louis police officer Jason Stockley shot and killed Anthony Lamar Smith, a drug suspect that he was trying to arrest. At the time, Stockley claimed that he saw Smith reaching for a gun, which is why he fired his. Self-defense,that all it ever is,isn it? The problemis was unarmed and nowthere not just evidence of that, butthere also evidence that Stockley may have done worse than lie. There is a strong possibility that he planted the gun inSmith car after murdering him to cover his own ass. Smith did flee the scene of a possible drug deal and a high-speed chase ensued. Stockley was carrying a personally-owned AK-47 that Smith, in escaping, almost knocked out of his hands. Stockley was not authorized to carry that weapon while on duty, which goes a long way towards demonstrating Stockley as an unethical officer at the very least. He was also recorded as saying that he was going to kill Smith.Stockley partner, Brian Bianchi, said that he warned Stockley about a revolver on the seat ofSmith car, and Stockley himself said he feared Smith was about to pull the revolver when he approached: ?Before striking me [with his car], I observed, in plain view in thesubject hand while resting on the passenger seat, a silver handgun. The handgun was pointing up and towards me? Because of the presence of a weapon and because I felt my personal safety was in jeopardy, as was the safety of P.O. Bianchi, and bystanders, I fired several shots at the subject.?It apparently hard to see in the videos whether Stockley handled the revolver; however,it damned telling that only his DNA was on the gun. Something of Smith would definitely have been there ifhe been handling the gun, as Stockley alleged. The St. Louis Board of Police Commissioners did pay a $900,000 settlement toSmith family in 2013, but Stockley himself was not charged with murder. That is, until this year, when this new evidence came to light. Stockley is now charged with first-degree murder, but is free on a $1 million bond. He left the St. Louis Police Department in 2013.

"Whoa, Obama has gone into full-on Hitler mode, talk about the boiling frog effect! He has been slowly stealing our freedoms so much that now announcing it to the worlddoesn even make major news! ?Giving up some freedom ofaction ourselves to the international rules over the long-term enhances our security.? At the end of his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, President Obama said the United States must give up a little freedom in exchange for security. ?We can only realize the promise of thisinstitution founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations, like my own, accept constraints,?

"Washington  The United States has reached the preliminary conclusion that Russian warplanes bombed an aid convoy and warehouse belonging to the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, two US officials told CNN. ""All the evidence we have points to that conclusion,"" one of the officials said. The White House position is that Russia is responsible, whether it was Russian planes -- or the Syrian regime's -- that carried out Monday night's attack. The aid convoy was hit in the area of Urum al-Kubra, west of Aleppo, prompting the United Nations to halt its aid operations in Syria. It is not clear who was responsible for the strike, which the International Committee of the Red Cross said killed about 20 people as well as the director of the Red Crescent's Urum al-Kubra branch, Omar Barakat. ""All of our information indicates clearly that this was an airstrike. That means there only could have been two entities responsible,"" deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Tuesday night, referring to Russia and Syria. He didn't specify which country's planes carried out the strike. ""We hold the Russian government responsible for airstrikes in this airspace given their commitment under the cessation of hostilities was to ground air operations where humanitarian assistance was flowing,"" Rhodes said, referring to the terms of a recent ceasefire brokered between the United States and Russia. Denials from Russia, Syria Russia denies it was responsible and says that terrorists carried out the attack. Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Tuesday that analysis of video footage from drones of the strike show that militants were following the convoy, according to the Russian state news site Tass. ""It is clearly seen in the video that a terrorists' pickup truck with a towed large-caliber mortar is moving along with the convoy,"" he said. Syria has also strongly its forces were behind the attack. UN outrage Just when we think it cannot get any worse, the power of depravity sinks lower. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon ""Just when we think it cannot get any worse, the power of depravity sinks lower,"" Ban told world leaders convening Tuesday at the UN General Assembly annual meeting. Eighteen of the convoy's 31 trucks were hit, the United Nations said. The convoy was due to deliver food and medical aid for some 78,000 people in eastern Aleppo, where an estimated 250,000 civilians are facing severe shortages as a result of a government siege. CNN Map Current intelligence Rebels, locked in a vicious civil war with the Syrian government, reportedly hold the area where the convoy was struck. Russia has been helping Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the fight, though it has said its efforts are focused on attacking terror groups such as ISIS that have flourished during the conflict.

MUST WATCH The struggle for a ceasefire in Syria 01:46 The US military has been reviewing classified radar, signals and aerial surveillance intelligence. Based on that intelligence and reports from the ground, it has concluded that only Russian warplanes were in a position to attack this location at the time, the official said. For now, no intelligence indicates Syrian aircraft or helicopters were in the area, though that type of information could come to light later, the official said. The official added that reports from the ground appear accurate about at least two waves of airstrikes -- a common Russian military practice. Trucks inside as well as outside the compound on the road were hit.

Soon afterward, Syrian warplanes resumed airstrikes in Aleppo, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and deadly violence returned across parts of the country. The events have left the hard-fought ceasefire brokered by Russia and the US in tatters, although US officials said they believe the ceasefire agreement is still in place.

"""The so-called caliphate will be crushed. The challenge will be: through the fingers of that crush are going to come hundreds of very, very dangerous people,"" FBI Director James Comey said at a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on the global terror threat. | AP Photo Comey warns of post-ISIL terrorist 'diaspora' FBI Director James Comey warned Tuesday that the increasing success of the military campaign against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq carries an ominous downside: a wave of terrorist fighters who will spread across the globe as the group loses control of its territory on the ground. ""The so-called caliphate will be crushed. The challenge will be: through the fingers of that crush are going to come hundreds of very, very dangerous people,"" Comey said at a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on the global terror threat. ""They will not all die on the battlefield in Syria and Iraq. There will be a terrorist diaspora sometime in the next two to five years like we've never seen before."" Story Continued Below ""We must prepare ourselves and our allies particularly in western Europe to confront that threat because when ISIL is reduced to an insurgency and those killers flow out they will try to come to western Europe and try to come here to kill innocent people,"" the FBI director said. He said the wave of fighters will be larger than the one that came out of Afghanistan after the war there in the 1980s. Committee Chairman Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) acknowledged that the territory governed by ISIL has decreased, but he said the campaign against the group has been so slow that the group is reconstituting elsewhere. ""Wehaven reduced their capability. The diaspora has already begun,"" Johnson said. ""We're poking the hive. We've done some damage to it but the killer bees are leaving the hive.They setting up new hives."" National Counterterrorism Center Director Nicholas Rasmussen said intelligence officials had long predicted the threat would metastasize as ISIL was squeezed. ""It?s not surprising. It puts us in a period of sustained vulnerability that Idon think any of us are comfortable with. But I thinkit a reality,"" he said. Despite the fears of terrorist fighters flowing out of Iraq and Syria, some senators said a more urgent worry is that the FBI is missing opportunities to head off home-grown terrorist attacks like the shooting at an Orlando nightclub in June where 49 people were killed and the bombings earlier this month in New York and New Jersey. Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) noted that FBI investigators looked at the suspects in those attacks long before the violence, but closed those inquiries without bringing charges. ""I'm also troubled the FBI is not even willing to admit they made some mistakes,"" Paul complained. ""These are judgment calls and the judgment calls were incorrect and I think we should just admit that and look at some of the facts."" Paul said the FBI failed to get video from a gun shop that could have shown shooter Omar Mateen buying a weapon shortly before the attack, but Comey said the FBI wasn't told about that visit promptly and by the time it was notified the video was already erased. However, Paul said the FBI should have kept an investigation into Mateen open longer because it might have exposed his plan to attack the Pulse nightclub. Comey said the FBI can keep such probes open indefinitely and repeatedly extended the one in Florida. ""We should keep them open longer...as long as the facts warrant,"" the FBI director said. ""We have the policies and the tools we need to do this well."" He added that agents have to make a ""judgement every day"" about whether specific cases merit further investigation. Ayotte questioned why agents handling the pre-shooting investigation of Mateen never looked at his social media or internet activity, even the publicly available information. Comey said the FBI had two people interacting directly with Mateen, leading the case agent to think he had ""a pretty good vector into [Mateen's] state of mind."" Ayotte said it still seemed odd that the FBI wouldn't also check his public online activity, especially as the FBI presses for more access to encrypted communications. ""It just seems surprising to me that therewasn some kind of online work done in something so significant,"" the New Hampshire Republican said. Comey said a review of the Florida probe is nearly done and another is in the works. He also said an assessment will be done of the handling of earlier inquiries into New York and New Jersey bombing suspect Ahmad Rahami, but that inquiry will be complicated by the pending prosecutions of the suspect who is currently in a Newark hospital being treated for a gunshot wound. ""We are going to go back,"" the FBI director said. ""You will find us being very candid about our shortcomings and our strengths.""",0.059033989,0.005366726,0.008944544,0.012522361000000001,0.08586762099999999,0.309481216,0.017889088,2,-1,1
"The Islamic State and its supporters shocked North America and Europe over the past year with a series of attacks, sowing public fear and becoming the top security issue in the U.S. presidential election. Journalist Rukmini Callimachi has become an indispensable guide to understanding thegroup cutting through the fog of misinformation from politicians. We asked Graeme Wood, a journalist known for his own groundbreaking Atlantic cover story tracing the IslamicState intellectual roots, to talk with Callimachi about whatit like to try to penetrate one of theworld most dangerous and shadowyorganizations whatwe still getting wrong. Graeme Wood:We still shocked and surprised by what ISIS does, even though this has been going on for years. The continued shock is partly due to their violence, but I wonder if it might be partly our fault, as journalists, for failing to help the public understand ISIS. What are we doing wrong? Rukmini Callimachi: The systemic failure in the media in covering ISIS is that the majority of reporters are doing it in a semaphore fashion. Their main entree to the group is what U.S. officials and analysts say, andthey not contacting members of the terror group or really studying its propaganda. Ican think of any other beat where we do that. If we cover a court case involving a murderer, we would still seek out the side of that murderer, even as we realize that what people say is going to be self-serving. Wood:You now interacted with many ISISpeople in person. What do they have in common? Callimachi: First, I would say, is ideology. I have never spoken to any member of these groups, not just ISIS, but also Al Qaeda, Shabab, etc., whowasn driven by the ideology. Beyond that, a lot of people are wounded in someway?ve fallen out of society in some manner. So the Sunday school teacher in Washington state, who in three months converted online and was planning for travel to the Islamic State, had been born with fetal alcohol syndrome,couldn hold down a job, had very few friends. You see an emptiness at the core of this person. All of the onesI spoken to seem to have veered off course from lives we consider acceptable and successful. Of course, there are others like Osama bin Laden, who was a wealthy and successful businessperson. Wood: Why do they talk to you? Callimachi:It become extremely difficult to speak to active ISIS members now. I was speaking to them in 2015, and the last one was killed in a drone strike. So now, ifI speaking to them,it afterthey defected. Of course there is self-selection there, because these are people who became disaffected. Wood: Do you think it helps thatyou a woman? Callimachi:It a double-edged sword.I had countless jihadis shut me down straightaway and say, ?I?m not allowed to speak to any woman who is not my relative.? But among the fewI able to get through to, I think that being female makes me more approachable, soft, all the stereotypes of what female means. Wood: What are the biggest remaining mysteries? What are the things we need to know that would really help us understand the group? Callimachi:I really curious as to the actual structure of the Emni [the intelligence unit that handles foreign attacks]. And Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the head of it. There are so few pictures of him. Wedon even really know what he looks like. For somebody with this outsized influence projecting murder abroad,you think that we would know a lot more by now. And then the role of the hostages. One of ISIS? biggest propaganda coups was the beheadings of the aid workers and journalists. Is [Emni], the group that is exporting fighters overseas, also the one that was holding James Foley and John Cantlie and Kayla Mueller? Wood: In one frightening quote, a jailed ISIS supporter tells you he thinks the number of ISIS operatives who have been sent to Europe is in the hundreds. Whyhaven we seen more attacks? Callimachi: You have to keep in mind thatthere a number of logistical hurdles that they have to jump through in Europe in order to get explosives or guns. So for example, the Villejuif shooter in April 2015 who planned to attack a church: According to French press reports, he was instructed by ISIS to go to a sandwich shop, and the weapons would be waiting for him in a car parked outside. He was just told the make of the car, told to go there, told to pick them up. Putting that kind of attack together, using encrypted communications or other means, is not easy. But during the height of Ramadan, I was covering one or two attacks a week. These are people willing to die. Wood: One changewe seen is a dramatic increase in body counts per attack. For a long time, they were very low, with many attacks killing no one but the attacker, but now with Paris, Orlando and Nice, the numbers are much higher. Do you think that ISIS is planning a spectacular attack, along the September 11model would that be too risky for them, too likely to be detected? Callimachi:They implementing what was the strategy of Al Qaeda, which was to have attacks of different levels simultaneously. ? So the idea is, on the one hand you have these spectacular attacks that take months to plan, and others like Reda Hame, a French national, who went to Syria and was there for about a week, given a couple of days of target practice and one day of encryption training, sent back and arrested almost immediately. And then there are the ones inspired solely through digital means, through the group reaching out through its propaganda and inciting them to attack. From what we are seeing, they are trying to do all three at the same time. It seems to me that a 9/11-style attack is impractical.They be putting in so many resources and so muchtime they can get the same horrific results from a guy with a truck. The death count is not the same, but the emotional impact for people in France was significant, and it took just a rental-car contract. Wood:We both written about ISIS? habit of justifying its actions with religious argument.What the best evidence for and against the view that a religious vision is at the core of what ISIS is doing? Callimachi: People who have left the group talk about how a religious inspiration took them to ISIS. It was their feeling of being marginalized as Muslims in the society where they were living, and then buying into the promise of a caliphate and of a Muslim land that is governed as in the time of the prophet. I have yet to meet anybody, or speak to anybody, who was not religiously motivated at some level. There are other things: the excitement of taking part in a war, a sense of belonging. The POLITICO 50 Our guide to the thinkers, doers and visionaries transforming American politics in 2016. Wood: When you talk to people who have removed themselves from ISIS, what do they say? Callimachi: They say that there comes a moment when the inconsistencies and apparent hypocrisies of their sheikh lets them down, and they begin rereading scripture and find ways that vouch for a nonliteralist reading of the Koran. We know that Muhammad waged war against the Qurayshi tribe, his own tribe, andit from that conflict that much of the concept of jihad and verses that ISIS now uses to justify beheadings come from. A young man just told me that he went back and read this carefully [and saw] the prophet and his people were fighting the Quraysh because they were not allowing the prophet and his people to practice their religion. We are now in a society, he said, where the Prophet Muhammad could practice his religion freely. So anyway, I find that interesting, you know: Scripture is also the way out.

" During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because ?hewould gotten it, if I wanted it.? But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul ? this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports: One of these stories is alie detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads toTrump mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when hedoesn want to admit he lost. Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even thoughBush story reinforced what Trump was saying atrallies had played the ?cash for outcomes? political game foryears could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless ofBushopposition Trump had wanted it. The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bushwould full well known, as would have Trump. Because afterTrumpna attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure.Eichenwald point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or: Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if hehadn been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony issimple wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect. Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater scandalfor half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find. Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlikeTrump other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and hisparty base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth onit head.Trump penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, butit a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President. See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald,there no third option here: Bush: ?The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views onsomething was generous and gave memoney Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.? Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: Ididn? Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and youdidn get it, because I was opposed to? Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before? Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after.I not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people. Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition: A lawyer asked Trump, ?Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?? Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-ElectBush I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida,didn you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But youdidn change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

"For many Americans, the choice they make on their ballots in November has everything to do with the role the next president will play in shaping our Supreme Court. Conservatives have emphasized how important it is that we elect someone who will fight for and preserve our constitutional rights by nominating justices who follow in the footsteps of the late Antonin Scalia. Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have laid out their plans for the country if elected, but, as pointed out by conservative evangelical leader Franklin Graham, only one candidate has released a list of potential Supreme Court nominees ? Trump. ?The public needs to recognize that this presidential election is not about personalities the way the media is trying to make it sound,? Graham wrote in a Facebook post Monday. The prominent religious leader argued, instead, that this presidential election is about filling the Supreme Court vacancy with someone who will follow the U.S. Constitution. TRENDING:Gov Confiscates Family Pet to Use as ?Educational Animal? ?This court and their rulings on issues of religious freedom, marriage, abortion, and much more will impact this country for our lifetime and the lifetime of our children and grandchildren,? Graham wrote. ?There?s so much on the line here.? Pointing out that the next president would nominate at least one justice ? and potentially several more ? over the next four years, Graham asked his friends to ?pray about who to vote for.? But, he also challenged us to educate ourselves on thecandidate potential Supreme Court nominees, so we will know where they stand on the future of thenation highest court ? something that is possible with only one candidate, Trump, because Clinton has not released a list of names she would consider. On Friday, Trump released his most recent update to a list of potential Supreme Court nominees, and it included a highly qualified and diverse field of candidates that is sure to satisfy conservatives and freedom-loving voters across the country. Meanwhile,we left to simply speculate about which anti-gun, anti-life and anti-religious freedom justice Clinton would nominate.That a scary thought, folks, and a risk not worth taking. Like and share on Facebook and Twitter if you agree with Franklin Graham that the Supreme Court is the most important issue of this election.

"Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016 Donald Trump Jr. Is quite possibly the dumbest person ever to take to social media. In the very least,it a tossup between him and little brother Eric, who just yesterday made a fool of himself with his childish self-admiration for being the answer to a crossword puzzle question, along with free wifi, pushup bras and Bozo the Clown. Together, the dimwitted duo provide enough social media fodder to make fun of them well into the next generation with posts to spare. When this election is finally over, it will be almost sad to see them fade back into oblivion. Maybewe keep track of their Twitter accounts just for a giggle every now and then.Today silliness begins with Oompa Loompa Jr. pinning a tweet that is certainly relevant to a particularly volatile national discussion happening right now: Colin Kaepernick and the National Anthem. As more and more athletes decide to take a knee in protest to support Black Lives Matter, more and more conservatives trash them for it, calling them unpatriotic and demanding they stop getting media coverage. Lord Cheeto II has been one of the most vocal, accusing Kaepernick of disrespecting our troops and those who died for his freedom. For the left,it a simple matter of the 1st Amendment. Regardless of how you feel about the issue, these athletes have the right to express themselves. Yes, that means from government oppression and prosecution and not public criticism, butlet not forget thatit people like Little Comb-Over who are calling for police to stop providing protection for these athletes, for their employers to terminate their contracts and some have even gone so far as to suggest they be jailed for treason. For years,we known that the only constitutional amendment conservatives care about is the second, so when this tweet appeared pinned to MiniDouche Twitter account this morning, Icouldn help but bust out in hysterical laughter: Clearly whenyou the son of pure evil you have a hard time understanding the words you use. When liberals? otherwise known as ?sane people? ? try to explain why people like Kaepernick and those who have followed his lead are expressing that very right,we attacked in a frenzy of hate by people who think placing your hand over your heart and singing a song is mandatory patriotism.It not. The first amendment is exactly today what it was when the founders added it to the framework of a growing nation in 1789; the right to be you. The Supreme Court has sided with those liberalsevery time the issue of free speech is tied to something conservatives think should be compulsory, like the pledge of allegiance and school prayer.I said it already once in this article and thousands of times in my everyday life andI say it again: The 2nd Amendment is the only one they see as absolute.

"Washington  Donald Trump's campaign manager sought to downplay concerns raised by a report Tuesday that the Republican nominee's personal philanthropy used more than $250,000 to litigate lawsuits against opponents of his business interests. Kellyanne Conway said she's not worried about the Washington Post report that said on four occasions the Donald J. Trump Foundation cut checks to settle suits in a controversial and potentially illegal tactic, given that the foundation is funded primarily with other donors' money, not his own, according to the Post review of legal documents and interviews. ""Trump is using his charities to benefit his businesses, which is against the law,"" Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold told CNN's John Berman and Kate Bolduan of his report. The most substantial donation was $100,000 to Fisher House, a veterans' charity, as part of a settlement with the city of Palm Beach, Florida, home to Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club. Conway defended the donation as a settlement because of a flag Trump wanted to raise at the Mar-a-Lago. ""I think this is a classic Donald Trump,"" she told CNN's Erin Burnett on ""OutFront."" ""He wanted to raise the American flag as high as he possibly could over Mar-a-Lago. I think a lot of Americans at this point would applaud that. And of course the county said he couldn't do that, it had to be smaller, so they started assessing a $1,250 fine. So the way they wanted to settle it was for Trump to donate $100,000 to a veteran's group."" And another check for $158,000 was distributed from the foundation as a way for a Trump golf course to settle another lawsuit, according to the Post. ""I've been talking to the people who are responsible for the Trump Foundation to get some facts and some figures,"" she said. ""It's very important for people to understand what happened in these cases. Donations went to veterans groups ... How did the Mar-a-Lago benefit from him giving $100,000 to veterans? The veterans benefited and I think that's great and I applaud him for doing that."" Burnett said: ""Well, the business benefited by the lawsuit going away and being settled, right? That would be how the business benefited."" ""Well, there are many lawsuits everyday against people ... I think you're making things up based on facts as they are not reported in this story, which also uses a lot of conditional phrasing, I'd like to point out,"" Conway said. Conway also added that Trump frequently is ""signing checks privately to help people"" from his own bank account separate from the foundation, ""You can only imagine how many people have asked Mr. Trump for his time and his resources and his connections and his money privately, and he does that and he doesn't have cameras in there, it doesn't go through foundations,"" she said. Burnett pointed that the public could verify those donations if Trump released his tax returns, to which Conway didn't directly respond. Trump's Foundation has come under scrutiny from investigators and Democrats over possible pay-for-play schemes. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is investigating the foundation to make sure it is abiding by state charity law, and House Democrats have called for the Department of Justice to look at Trump's relationship with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who declined to formally investigate it.",0.046153846,0.0,0.005128205,0.012820513,0.066666667,0.307692308,0.002564103,2,-1,1

"A shooter opened fire at the Cascade Mall on Friday night, killing five people and fleeing the scene of the crime. Dozens of police officers are currently searching for the gunman, described as a Hispanic man in his 20s or 30s. Authorities believe the man acted alone, thoughit possible that he received help, a spokesperson for the patrol, Sgt. Mark Francis, said in a midnight briefing outside the mall. ?I?d be extremely diligent and careful if you come in contact with the suspect,? Francis warned. ?Stay indoors, stay secure.? The shooter killed four women in the cosmetics department of aMacy department store at the Burlington shopping center, which is located 65 miles north of Seattle. Another man suffered critical injuries but passed away Saturday morning, Sgt. Francis said on Twitter. The gunman, armed with a long hunting rifle, left before police arrived. The mall was quickly evacuated around 8pm, minutes after the shooting took place. There has been no indication that the event was terror-related, Washington State Trooper spokeswoman Heather Axtman told NBC News, adding that the motive remains unclear. ?We?re still trying to gather as many witnesses as we can to get more information,? she said. Eric Mathews, 40, intended to meet his teenage son Kai at the mall on Friday night, arriving just as the shooting occurred.

"Washington  Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by 6 points ahead of the first debate on Monday, according to a new national poll released Wednesday. A four-way matchup shows Clinton has 43% support of likely voters while Trump has 37%, in the new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll . Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson is at 9% and the Green Party's Jill Stein is at 3%. In a two-way matchup, Clinton leads Trump by 7 points, 48% to 41%.

Despite a recent effort to court African-American voters, Trump garners just 7% support compared to Clinton's 81% with the voting bloc. On the issues, Trump has the advantage with voters when it comes to the economy -- 46% to 41%. But Clinton leads when it comes to being in charge of nuclear weapons (51% to 25%), being a good commander in chief (48% to 33%) and on immigration (50% to 39%).

"BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown? Rumors have surfaced that Hillary Clinton may be having a nervous breakdown. In this video we posted yesterday, Clinton appears to lose eye control. Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. Howeverit was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about HillaryClinton schedule. Interesting fact?.I just searched HillaryClinton rally events scheduled between September 20 ? October 19 ? She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the scheduledoesn list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!! There are many questions about her health, and admittedlyI no expert. However I am a realist. I recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip onClinton left hand. I further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down. Further rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, anddoesn appear to want to be president any longer. No matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it. As for HillaryClinton health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Leftwon be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the ?conspirators.? Worse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores. Expect lots more on this to surface over the next few days.",0.026200873,0.008733624,0.0,0.021834061000000002,0.030567686,0.266375546,0.0,1,-1,0
"Democratic Rep. Corrine Brown, who is currently facing felony charges for fraud, is trying to solicit donations online to fund her legal defense. Brown, who currently representsFlorida 5th congressional district, was indicted in July on more than 20 counts of fraud. According to federal prosecutors, Brown and a collaborator presented the non-profit One Door for Education as a scholarship fund, but instead used its finances as a personal slush fund. Brown supposedly used the money to pay off back taxes and fund public events honoring herself. Despite raising $800,000, One Door awarded only a single $1,000 scholarship.Brown political fortunes have collapsed since the indictment, but she has refused to give in. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and has refused to resign her seat even after losing the Democratic primary in August. Now, Brown launched another fundraising campaign, trying to convince supporters they should fund her criminal defense. On the page for the Corrine Brown Legal Expense Trust, Brown argues that she is being prosecuted by sinister forces who want to bring down a powerful black woman.

"Washington  When Bernie Sanders stood before the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, he promised ""to do everything I can"" to elect Hillary Clinton president. But for much of the summer, Sanders was consumed with authoring a book he plans to release in November, while raising money for progressive candidates down the ticket. He has done just a handful of campaign events for Clinton, and hasn't yet activated his grassroots army that powered him to win more than 12 million votes during the Democratic primary. That's about to change. In recent days, Sanders has privately informed his old rival that he plans a surge of campaign events in key battleground states, including ones the Vermont independent won during the Democratic primary campaign and others with pockets of younger voters turned off by Clinton, according to two sources familiar with the conversations between the two camps. That means more stops in states like Michigan and New Hampshire, and possible trips to Nevada, Pennsylvania, Colorado and Wisconsin. The Clinton camp even plans to deploy Sanders to Minnesota, a state likely to go Democratic in the fall but one the Clinton camp is quietly trying to shore up as Donald Trump gains ground across the country, sources said. On Wednesday, Sanders will appear with Clinton in Durham, New Hampshire, an effort aimed directly at millennials by promoting college affordability. And it comes at a crucial time: Clinton is seeing her support stall among millennial voters, who are turning to Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson instead. In a Tuesday interview with CNN, Sanders promised that he would make the case directly to millennials about Clinton's proposal to ease tuition payments to families earning less than $125,000 annually, calling it a ""big deal."" And he said that he would draw a direct contrast between Trump and Clinton on the issue of humans causing global warming, which the GOP nominee has questioned in the past. ""To the degree that we get those points out, I think she will do a whole lot better among younger people,"" Sanders said. Asked if he should do more for Clinton after keeping a relatively low profile after the convention, Sanders said: ""We will be working very aggressively."" But he would not answer directly when asked if he would activate his small donor network to pour money into Clinton's coffers. ""I'm going to be campaigning as hard as I can,"" Sanders said. A source close to Sanders said it's unlikely he would use his vast email list to help Clinton raise money, instead reserving that for down-ticket candidates. Instead, the source said, Sanders will become a visible presence along the campaign trail in an attempt to turn his core supporters to the Clinton camp -- namely younger voters. Indeed, millennial voters are becoming a significant problem for Clinton, dogged by her email controversy, questions about her honesty and being a long-time fixture of the Democratic establishment. In a Bloomberg poll released this week, Clinton leads Trump 50%-40% among voters under 35 in a two-way race, down from her 29-point lead in August. But when the poll added the Green Party and Libertarian candidates on the ballot, Clinton's lead shrinks to 40%-36% -- with Johnson getting 11% of the millennial vote. To reverse the slide, the Clinton campaign plans to lean on Sanders and other progressive firebrands, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, to fire up the base. But top Democrats say that surrogates can only do so much. ""Bernie is going to be out there some more; he's just finishing his book,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday. ""He has been out there for Hillary. He'll be out there more, but she is going to have to make her own case as well because you can only transfer so much."" After a tense primary where Sanders surprised Clinton and the political world by racking up big victories, the two sides developed trust during the July convention when the Vermont independent's team helped squash an uprising by Sanders' backers eager to disrupt the proceedings. On Labor Day, he barnstormed New Hampshire for Clinton -- with two events in the state -- and later did a three-city swing through Ohio. A source close to Sanders said the senator plans to hit the road for House and Senate candidates starting next week, including in states like Washington not considered a presidential battleground. But with Sanders' ability to connect with younger progressives at a time when Clinton is struggling with those voters, many are eager to see the self-described Democratic socialist follow through on his vow to do more to help their presidential nominee. ""We all know the last 30 days is really when you motivate people, and say, 'Hey. You can't sit home, you can't stay out.' And I think (Sanders) knows that's the crucial point,"" said Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, a top Clinton surrogate. Asked if she were worried about millennial voters flocking to Johnson, McCaskill added: ""It doesn't seem thoughtful to me. It does feel like he could be a spoiler in some regard. But I still feel pretty positive and optimistic about millennials coming around -- especially with Bernie and Elizabeth Warren, and everybody's help.""",0.038155802999999995,0.0063593,0.0063593,0.015898251000000002,0.060413355,0.26709062,0.00317965,2,-1,1
"Matt Mowers arrives for a court hearing Friday, Sept. 23, 2016. | AP Photo/Julio Cortez At Bridgegate trial, Trump aide describes how Christie's office tracked endorsements NEWARK ? A Donald Trump aide who worked for Gov. Chris Christie testified in federal court Friday that the Republicangovernor office meticulously tracked which local mayors had received special treatment and how likely they were to endorse his re-election campaign. Matt Mowers, who was an aide inChristie Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, or IGA, told prosecutors that the office used a Google Document to note when a local mayor or council person had been invited to sporting events, invited to breakfast at thegovernor mansion or received steel from the wreckage of the World Trade Center. Story Continued Below Mowers, testifying in the George Washington Bridge lane closure trial, said officials were given a score on a scale of 1-10 about how likely they were to endorseChristie 2013 campaign. Mowers said in U.S. District Court that the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, where the bridge is located, was among those officials. Mowers had been assigned to the mayor, Mark Sokolich, and other officials in the northern part of the state, as part of his job at a regional director with the office. Sokolich, he wrote in the document, had a good chance of being persuaded. ?Only thing that could prevent endorsement is possible ambition for higher office (county executive),? Mowers said he wrote about the Democrat from Bergen County. Mowers said he spoke to Sokolich frequently, meeting with the mayor about once a month and also calling every few weeks. They attended sporting events. They helped get Port Authority funding for local shuttle buses, with the governor writing the bistate agency a letter requesting the buses. Mowers said Sokolich even request a letter of recommendation from the governor to help his son get into Rutgers University. The two had a good, friendly relationship, Mowers said. By 2013, they began discussing the possibility that Sokolich would endorse Christie ? at themayor request, said Mowers, who is currently a national field coordinator working on the Trump campaign. Sokolich testified earlier in the week that Mowers had been pushing him to endorse and thathe felt uncomfortable at times. But Mowers said the mayor was so interested that he discussed having the entire town council endorse Christie, and suggested doing so after the Democratic primary so as not to upset the county party bosses. ?Given that he brought it up and the rest of the council was interested in endorsing as well,? Mowers said, he thought it ?was something he would consider.? But Sokolich ultimately told him hecouldn do it, Mowers said. Mowers said that at a meeting in March 2013 in Fort Lee, the mayor said he was concerned about his private business as a zoning attorney, and that he could lose contracts with local municipalities for endorsing Christie. Mowers sent a text message to a higher ranking employee in the IGA saying what happened: ?Unfortunately, I think Sokolich is going to be a no.It a shame, too, I really like the guy.? He added in another message: ?He flat out said ?I wish I had the balls to do it?.? Mowers left thegovernor office to join the Trump campaign the next month. He said he heard twice after that from Bridget Anne Kelly, who was his boss atgovernor office, asking ifhe heard from Sokolich again. First she called him on his cell phone on the evening of August 12. ?At first, she called and we exchange pleasantries,? he said. ?Then she asked if Mayor Sokolich is definitely not endorsing.? ?Ok, great,that all I needed to know,? she replied, Mowers said. On Sept. 9, two local access lanes to the George Washington Bridge were closed, causing major traffic jams in Fort Lee. It was that day that Kelly sent Mowers a message asking again about Sokolich and whether they had spoken. He said they had not. Kelly, who was a deputy chief of staff to the governor, and Bill Baroni, who was the deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, are accused of closing access lanes to the bridge to punish Sokolich for refusing to endorse Christie. The Port controls the bridge. They allegedly worked with David Wildstein, who was the director of interstate capital projects for the bi-state agency. He had already pleaded guilty and plans to testify against both defendants this afternoon. Christie, who is currently a top adviser to Trump, has denied any knowledge or involvement in the lane-closing incident. But prosecutors said on Monday the governor was told of the traffic gridlock on the third day of the lane closings. Baroni and Kelly, both 44, were indicted last May on charges of conspiracy, fraud and civil rights violations.",0.045855379,0.003527337,0.007054674,0.012345678999999998,0.074074074,0.21516754899999999,0.001763668,2,-1,1
"Washington  President Barack Obama said Saturday that the new Smithsonian museum devoted to African-American history elevates the often-overlooked impact of black Americans and will help others better understand the breadth of the American story. ""This national museum helps to tell a richer and fuller story of who we are,"" Obama, the first African-American president, said at the National Museum of African-American History and Culture. ""By knowing this other story we better understand ourselves and each other. It binds us together. It reaffirms that all of us are America, that African-American history is not somehow separate from our larger American story,"" he added. ""It is central to the American story."" Saturday's opening ceremony for the museum also was attended by civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis, former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton and Chief Justice John Roberts. Thousands are expected to have descended on the National Mall this weekend to celebrate the museum's opening. Calling it an ""act of patriotism"" to understand African-American history and the struggles of all Americans, Obama said ""a great nation doesn't shy away from the truth."" ""We're not a burden on America or a stain on America or an object of shame and pity for America. We are America,"" Obama said. ""And that's what this museum explains."" ""Hopefully, this museum makes us talk to each other and listen to each other and see each other,"" he added. Obama also said the museum can provide context to the current national debate on the relationship between law enforcement and black communities that recently made headlines following the police shooting deaths of black men in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Perhaps it can help a white visitor understand the pain and anger of demonstrators in places like Ferguson (Missouri) and Charlotte. But it can also help black visitors appreciate the fact that not only is this younger generation carrying on traditions of the past, but within the white communities across the nation, we see the sincerity of law enforcement officers and officials who, in fits and starts, are struggling to understand and trying to do the right thing,"" he said. ""It reminds us that routine discrimination and Jim Crow aren't ancient history. It's just a blink in the eye of history,"" Obama continued. Star-studded event Saturday's event included musical performances by Stevie Wonder, Patti LaBelle and Denyce Graves, as well as appearances by Robert De Niro and Angela Bassett, who read the words of black poets and historians. The effort to bring this museum to life began decades ago but was finally set in motion in 2003 when Bush signed a bill creating it. Ground was broken in February 2012. The Smithsonian says the museum is the only one in the US exclusively focused on African-American life, history and culture, but organizers say it is also meant to capture the story of all Americans. One of those who have worked for years to see this museum come to life is educator and historian Lonnie Bunch, founding director for the museum. Asked what does it mean to him to see it finally open, he said, ""It means that finally the African-American story on the National Mall is accessible to everybody, and in many ways it means that my ancestors are smiling,"" he told CNN. ""This is framed in a way that this is everybody's story. It is not a black people's story. It is a story of America."" Slavery and freedom at focus Officials said the chronicling of slavery and freedom are the centerpiece of the museum. That exhibit contains such items as a slave cabin from South Carolina, a bill of sale for a 16-year-old girl for $600, shackles used on slaves and a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation. There is also an exhibition focusing on the fight against segregation, which discusses the era from end of Reconstruction through the Civil Rights Movement. Here, visitors see such things as abolitionist Harriet Tubman's hymn book to a dress Rosa Parks was making shortly before she was arrested for not giving up her seat on a segregated bus; a Tuskegee airplane used to train African-American pilots for World War II flights; a segregated Pullman train car as well as a stool from the Woolworth store where there were sit-ins in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1960; and separate water fountains.

The museum holds more than 3,000 artifacts -- with many contributed from ordinary Americans from across the country. There are also tens of thousands of other artifacts which have been contributed which could be rotated later into exhibition space. There are also many iconic items celebrating the achievements in sports, music, television and film including Michael Jackson's fedora hat worn during his 1984 ""Victory Tour,"" boxer Muhammad Ali's headgear, musician Chuck Berry's Cadillac, baseball star Jackie Robinson's bat, some of Olympian Gabby Douglas' items as well as a statue honoring American athletes who held their hands up as a demonstration of solidarity during the 1968 Gold Medal ceremony.

"Story highlights President Barack Obama had vetoed the bill It initially won overwhelming support in Congress Washington (CNN) The Senate will vote Wednesday to override President Barack Obama's veto of a bill to give victims and families of the 9/11 terrorist attacks the legal right to sue Saudi Arabia for any purported role in the plot, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday. The measure will need a two-thirds vote of the chamber to succeed -- which is expected -- before going to the House for a similar override vote later this week. It would be the first time in Obama's nearly eight years in office that one of his vetoes will be overturned. The President opposes the bill because he says it could open the door to lawsuits against the US for actions taken by military service members, diplomats and others. Obama expressed sympathy for the 9/11 families in his veto message Friday, but said he vetoed the bill because the law would hurt the effectiveness of the administration's action against terrorism by taking questions of foreign states' involvement in terrorism ""out of the hands of national security and foreign policy professionals and placing them in the hands of private litigants and courts.""

"New Clinton Foundation SCANDAL Just Broke ? This Is What Hillary ACTUALLY Thinks About Black People? This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with Clintonin it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed ?watered-down? HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this? the question is, did the Clintons know about it.I betting that they did. Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this. ?This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and thenation largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,? said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty. From The Daily Caller: Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed ?watered-down? HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and ?likely increased? the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,?The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,? was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the ClintonFoundation most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. ? 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The congressional report focused onClinton decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. ?The question becomes, ?how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,?? asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF. This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the ClintonFoundation aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the ?watered-down? drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money. ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered ?more than $1.8 million packages.? ?Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,? Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.Ranbaxy generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide.

Interested in Elections? Add Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest In fact, 6 percent of Americans saidthere a ?good chance? that tonight could swing their vote one way or another ? more than the margin between the two candidates in most national polls over the last month. Here are the groups to watch for duringtonight debate: 1. Young voters. Almost 3 in 10 young voters (28 percent) polled said they could switch their vote based ontonight face-off between Clinton and Trump. A broad 60 percent of these voters went for President Barack Obama in 2012, but many are threatening to vote for third-party candidates Gary Johnson or Jill Stein this year. 2. People whodon like either candidate. A good number of Americans surveyed who said theydon like either major party candidate said they could change their minds tonight. Twenty-seven percent of Americans who have an unfavorable view of both Clinton and Trump said they could change their minds, versus only 13 percent of those who like at least one of them. 3. Bernie Sanders supporters. A quarter of Americans polled who backed the Vermont senator during the Democratic primaries (26 percent) said they might flip candidates based ontonight debate. Only 74 percent of them saidthey voting for Clinton, with 9 percent going for Trump and 12 percent split between Johnson and Stein. 4. Independents. A quarter of Americans (24 percent) surveyed who are not affiliated with either political party said their votes could be up in the air duringtonight debate. Trump has a statistically insignificant advantage among this group, 43 percent toClinton 38 percent, with 10 percent going for Johnson and 2 percent for Stein. 5. People who are on the fence about voting. People who might not show up to the polls are also more likely to consider switching their votes. Only 11 percent of Americans polled who have followed the race ?very closely? and 14 percent of those who were ?absolutely certain? they will vote said they could change their minds.That compared with 24 percent and 25 percent of those who have followed the race less closely and were less certain to vote, respectively. 6. Unenthusiastic voters. Respondents who were ?very enthusiastic? about voting for Clinton and Trump were largely set in stone: Only 9 percent of ?very enthusiastic? Clinton backers and 3 percent of ?very enthusiastic? Trump supporters said they could change their minds.That compared with 22 percent of less enthusiastic Clinton backers and 18 percent of less enthusiastic Trump supporters. 7. Weaker partisans and ideologues. Very strong partisans were less likely to be open to changing their votes tonight: Just 10 percent of strong conservatives, 12 percent of liberal Democrats and 6 percent of conservative Republicans said the debates could change their votes. White men without a college degree (13 percent) and people who make $100,000 per year or more (11 percent) were also less likely to be open to a flip tonight.

"Story highlights The FBI is investigating a possible hack of Democratic Party staffer cell phones Johnson told Congress that 18 states have asked for help defending against cyberattacks Washington (CNN) The FBI has asked to examine the cell phones of a small number Democratic Party staffers as it investigates a possible hack, law enforcement and Democratic sources told CNN Tuesday. The development comes on the same day Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told lawmakers that 18 states have asked for help in warding off cyberattacks on their electronic voting systems. Law enforcement officials have reached out to the staffers individually about ""imaging"" their phones to search for evidence of hacking, such as malware. Investigators are still probing whether this attempted hack is part of the original breach of Democratic National Committee emails -- which is widely thought to be the work of the Russian government -- or a new hacking attempt. ""Our struggle with the Russian hackers that we announced in June is ongoing -- as we knew it would be -- and we are choosing not to provide general updates unless personal data or other sensitive information has been accessed or stolen,"" interim DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile told CNN. Meanwhile, Johnson outlined to the Senate Homeland Security Committee the concerns states had about defending their voting systems from hackers.

"In a letter shared with ABC News, six senators have slammed Wells Fargo bank for its use of forced arbitration clauses in its customer account agreements, which the senators say enabled the company to keep its accounts scandal out of the public eye and the courts for years, and asked embattled CEO John Stumpf to provide information so that they can ?better understand the situation at Wells Fargo? and ""prevent similar fraudulent practices in the future."" Interested in Wells Fargo? Add Wells Fargo as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Wells Fargo news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Arbitration, mandated in some if not all basic agreements that customers sign when they open accounts at the bank, ""helps hide fraudulent schemes such as the sham accounts at Wells Fargo from the justice system, from the news media, and from the public eye,"" the senators wrote. The senators also write, ?These clauses eliminate consumers? ability to bring a claim in open court or to band together in a class action, before any dispute has arisen. Forced arbitration clauses deny access to the courts even when consumers are seeking to enforce their rights under fundamental state and federal laws?. ""Arbitration proceedings are kept secret, so that other customers are deprived of the knowledge that their experiences might be part of a more widespread problem,"" according to the six senators. The letter was written by Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Al Franken (D-MN), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). ""It is particularly unacceptable that forced arbitration clauses in contracts for real customer accounts were used to deny customers access to the court system to challenge WellsFargo creation of sham accounts,"" the group wrote. ""We have serious concerns that your forced arbitration policies thrust consumers into a system with little transparency or oversight."" The letter is the latest in a series of headaches for the company, which faces allegations from regulators that employees opened or applied for accounts without customers' knowledge or permission. On Thursday, a group of senators, some of whom also signedtoday letter, asked the Department of Labor to open an investigation into Wells Fargo's employment practices, and on Tuesday, Stumpf appeared before the Senate Banking Committee, facing blistering questions over the accounts scandal. Separately on Thursday, Stumpf resigned from his position on the Federal Advisory Council, the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank told ABC News. The council generally meets with the Federal Reserve four times a year to advise it on banking and economic issues. In a consent decree between the bank and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the bank has not admitted to or denied any wrongdoing. Arbitration clauses are common in many contracts that consumers sign regularly, attorney David I. Greenberger, an employment law expert at the Bailey Duquette firm in New York City, told ABC News. In many cases, they can benefit consumers by allowing parties to settle disputes more quickly and cheaply than if they go through a sometimes long and drawn-out court battle. Increasingly, however, concerns have grown that they can be used to keep details out of the public eye, since arbitration proceedings are typically not made public. ""The original purpose, from my view ... was that it would allow for a faster, more efficient and more expedient process for the parties to resolve their dispute,? Greenberger said. ""It has changed over time and I think you can now, in some forms, question whetherit faster...or [more] expedient,"" Greenberger told ABC News. ""It?s become a way in which disputes can be kept private and kept from being aggregated in the class context."" A Wells Fargo spokeswoman told ABC News: ""We are reviewing the letter and will respond to the senators who requested this information but have no further comment at this time.""",0.023157895,0.0,0.014736842,0.008421053000000001,0.054736842,0.282105263,0.0,2,-1,1
"BEHIND THE SCENES of the first debate: WHO WAS TALKING TO WHO, PHOTOS -- NARRATIVE: CLINTON wins -- GIULIANI: ?I?d skip next debates if I were Trump? --B: Juleanna Glover Driving the Day Good morning from Hempstead, New York. The general consensus is this: Donald Trumpdidn throw up on his shoes. But Hillary Clinton had the far better night in their first 90-minute (it actually lasted 95 minutes) matchup here at Hofstra University on Long Island. Clinton mostly kept her cool -- as did Trump for the first portion of the evening. Trump ended up citing Sid Blumenthal, RosieO and referring viewers to Sean Hannity to vouch for his opposition to the Iraq War. The pre-debate buzz among reporters here was that Trump left himself the option to come to the spin room, but would only show up if he needed to change the narrative. He came to the spin room, and then spoke to Hannity live from the press filing center. Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) pointed out that ?shecan remember last time, if ever, a general election candidate went to the spin room.? Not a good sign for Trump. LAST NIGHT Hillary Clinton ended the debate by saying, ?And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman Ms. Piggy. Then he called her Ms. Housekeeping, because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name...Her name is Alicia Machado and she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet she's going to vote this November."" Story Continued Below THIS MORNING Donald Trump went on ?Fox and Friends? and said Machado was ?the worst? contestant they had and chided her for gaining weight. ?She was impossible...She was the winner and you know she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem...This was many years ago, and [Clinton] found the girl and talked about her like she was Mother Teresa and itwasn quite that way, butthat okay. Hillary has to do what she has to do.? Video clip http://bit.ly/2cA06xi (h/t Alex Burns) **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/1M75UbX --WHAT?S NEXT: The next presidential debate -- in St. Louis on Oct. 9 -- gives Trump an opportunity to bounce back. Remember: Mitt Romney trounced Barack Obama in the first debate. But the second event, which will be held at Wash. U., is a town hall, which brings its own challenges for both candidates. Clinton mostly skated on some ofTrump signature attacks: Benghazi, her private email server, the FBI investigation, immigration and the Clinton Foundation. Trump is certain to hammer away on those issues in the coming weeks, and try to inject them into the conversation in Missouri. The vice presidential debate is in Farmville, Virginia, on Oct. 4 -- one week from today. WHAT TO WATCH FOR: How the down-ballot candidates react. Top Republican operatives running Senate and House races say theyweren thrilled, but theydon know thatTrump bad night moves the needle. The early take is that Trump was stable for the first 30 minutes, which gives Republicans hope that any negative impact will be limited. 42 DAYS until Election Day. The government shuts down Friday. THE NARRATIVE -- ?Clinton set the trap and Trump walked in: The Democrat dominated the debate. Will it matter?? by Eli Stokols: ??Donald was very fortunate in his life, andthat all to his benefit,? Clinton started. ?He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.? Trump quickly dismissedClinton characterization, saying he received ?a very small loan? that he turned into a company valued, he claimed, in the billions. ?I say that only becausethat the kind of thinking that our country needs.? In the moment, he seemedcalm from that point forward he was anything but. ?She mind-screwed him from the beginning by mentioning the loan from his father,? said Rob Stutzman, a GOP operative in California. ?That was brilliant psychological warfare on her part.

"Story highlights The military assesses the weapon to be a ""sulfur mustard blister agent"" Dunford said the Russians ""are responsible"" for attack on Syria UN aid convoy Washington (CNN) The military assesses that the shell fired on a joint US-Iraqi base Tuesday was indeed a chemical weapon, according to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford. ""We assess it to be a sulfur mustard blister agent,"" Dunford told the Senate Armed Services Committee Thursday. It is the first time the military has confirmed its assessment on the record since CNN reported the development Wednesday. A US military official told CNN, however, that the first field test for chemical agent was positive and the second test was negative. The substance was sent to a coalition-operated Iraq-based lab, and tests there were inconclusive. The official said the sample will now be sent to another lab for additional testing. Dunford described ISIS as only having a ""rudimentary"" capability to deliver the chemical, saying the weapon ""wasn't particularly effective, but it is a concerning development.""",0.03030303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053030303,0.151515152,0.0,2,-1,1
"Russian President VladimirPutin party has won national parliamentary elections with a significantly increased majority, a result that cements Putin's total control over the country's political life and which potentially grants him the ability to change Russia's constitution. With 93% of the vote counted, the party, United Russia, was shown to have taken 343 of 450 seats in the lower house of parliament, a sizable increase on its previous 238 seats. Interested in Russia Investigation? Add Russia Investigation as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia Investigation news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest The vote was marked by an exceptionally low turnout of just 40 percent, illustrating a sense among many Russians that the election was of little importance in a country where the Kremlin determines all major policy decisions and elections are seen as stage-managed. Eduard Korniyenko/Reuters Still, the result reinforced the political system engineered by the Kremlin under Putin over the past 16 years. The two parties that took second and third place are nominally in opposition to the Russian leader but in practice almost invariably support the Kremlin line. Reflecting the strength of nationalist feeling in Russia following the seizure of Crimea , the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party came second to United Russia with around 15 percent of the vote, a strong showing for the party that is led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a man regularly described asRussia Donald TrumpRussia Communist Party came a close third, while the anti-Putin opposition failed to break the 5% barrier to enter parliament, losing its only lawmaker there. The win gives United Russia a two-thirds majority that allows it to amend the constitution. United Russia's head, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev declared victory and Putin congratulated the party, saying it showed ""political maturity"" among Russians. The outcome was not surprising. With the country strongly behind Putin -- whose approval ratings stand around 80 percent -- and the opposition effectively sidelined, the vote had been described by some observers as the dullestelection in Russian history. The only surprise was the scale of United Russia's win, overcoming polls suggesting it would have a poor showing. That was in stark contrast to the last time Russians voted for their parliament in 2011, when significant vote-rigging prompted huge street protests. Tens of thousands marched in Moscow demandingPutin resignation in what was the biggest popular challenge to his rule that the Russian leader has faced. Such upheavals seem now all but impossible, underlining the vivid shift inRussia political atmosphere since then. Eager to avoid a repeat of2011 trouble, this time the Kremlin has sought to create an impression that the vote would be clean. It removed the head ofRussia elections commission -- pejoratively nicknamed the wizardfor his ability to make the numbers add up inPutin favor, and replacing him with a respected human rights defender. Confident thecountry beleaguered opposition was without traction among the public, authorities had also opened up a small breathing space for them during the elections allowing them to field more candidates and to take part in TV debates. Those moves led many to predict the elections would not see significant amounts of voting fraud. With popular sentiment aggressively pro-Putin and most Russians convinced of the impossibility of political change, there appeared little need for vote rigging. How true that was was still being debated on Monday. Following the vote across Russia's 11 time zones, it was clear that the vote had been far from pristine, with growing reports of cheating and numerous videos appearing to show ballot-stuffing, but there were few claims that the violations had had any decisive impact. While threatening to annul some results where cheating was recorded, the head ofRussia elections commission, Ella Pamfilova, said was sure the vote had been legitimate, the TASS state news agency reported. Although the vote may prove to be cleaner than in the past, critics said it was not fairer. Under Putin, the Kremlin has neuteredRussia political debates, creating a pseudo-opposition and marginalizing actual opponents by jailing or blocking them from running, largely barring them from television, and harassing their campaigns. The parliament itself has become a rubber-stamping body, directed on how to act on most issues by the Kremlin and offering no opposition on major decisions. Before today the unauthorized opposition, the so-called ?nonsystem opposition?, had only one lawmaker in the parliament, and its leaders and activists have been continuously harassed and occasionally physically attacked. This year, as part of the experiment to lend greater legitimacy to the elections, anti-Putin parties were given greater leeway. That step, however, seemed to reflect theKremlin confidence in its position rather than any newfound political liberalism. With the country wrapped in nationalist sentiment followingCrimea annexation and intensified repression of dissent, there is virtually no desire for major political change. Yabloko and Parnas, the two leading parties running on anti-Putin platforms, both failed to get above the 5%, with the early results suggesting that Russia's parliament would now not have a single openly anti-Putin lawmaker in parliament. With the final result never in doubt, there was a sensation of the system going through the motions and the majority of Russians appeared to opt out of the vote, viewing it as of little relevance. Many Russians said theycan remember a more lackluster election run. Even the Kremlin official tasked with managing the vote, Vladimir Volodin, has described UnitedRussia campaign as ?sterile?, telling the business paper RBC that he believed the tactic was not to produce enthusiasm for the party but just to bring off a technically irreproachable campaign. The apathy was reflected in a record low turnout, at 40.37% the lowest since Putin took power in 2000 and 20% lower than in the contested election in 2012. In Moscow, the turnout was just 33%. In the days prior to voting, a startling number of Russians were not even aware the elections were happening. The sharp drop in participation compared with 2011, suggested that Russians' beliefs in what was politically possible in the country had narrowed considerably. At polling stations in Moscow on Sunday, many voters said they expected the vote to be cleaner than in previous years, though few expected it would be totally without fraud. Many, even those voting for the ruling party, were ambivalent about whether the vote showed Russia had democracy. Asked whether he felt Russia was democratic, one man pulled face and made a half-and-half gesture with his hand. ?Does Russia have democracy?,? Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich, 63, said before voting. ?Maybe. Probably we have some kind of democracy. Idon know, Ihaven seen any other kind.? Others were more definite, saying that although they did not believe they had full-fledged democracy, it was important to vote to keep what elements of it still exist in Russia. ?At the very least, it opposes the trend of authoritarianism that has appeared in Russia recently,? Lev Karakhan, a television producer accompanied by his children said after voting.",0.033374536,0.0049443759999999995,0.009888751999999999,0.025957973,0.058096415,0.292954265,0.00618047,2,-1,1
"Story highlights The rancor comes after Priebus said party members need to ""get on board"" House Republicans said opposing Trump could impact political futures Washington (CNN) A brewing civil war within the GOP has House Republicans picking sides, with plenty of members backing up party Chairman Reince Priebus in threatening consequences for those who don't get behind nominee Donald Trump. ""Any person in this party that does not support Trump at this point is increasing the chances of Hillary Clinton becoming president and destroying the Constitution,"" Arizona Rep. Trent Franks told CNN Wednesday. ""Therefore they are betraying this party. They are betraying the Constitution."" Franks had endorsed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the primary. The rancor comes after Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that if Trump opponents don't ""get on board,"" it's not ""going to be that easy for them"" to run for office again. The remark appeared to be directed at former presidential candidates like Cruz, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, and former Florida Gov.

"AP Photo Bridgegate trial brings Christie impeachment talk into the open Its prospects are far from clear, but talk about the impeachment of Gov. Chris Christie is no longer relegated to whispers between insiders. Theprosecution opening argument in the Bridgegate case ? which featured the claim that Christie was told of the George Washington Bridge lane closures as they happened by two high ranking Port Authority of New York and New Jersey appointees ? brought the talk into the open. Story Continued Below Now Democratic lawmakers who control the Assembly and state Senate are watching the trial carefully to see if any more revelations could warrant the attempted removal of the governor from office. ?All we know are the coming attractions that were given to us by each of the attorneys during their opening statements.They all told us there will be proof at the trial that he governor knew about this,? said Assemblyman John Wisniewski, who helped break the controversy open as the leader of a committee investigating the Fort Lee bridge access lane closures that tied up traffic for days. ?Wedon know exactly what that proof is,? Wisniewski said. ?For instance, is it merely the photograph of the three of them talking before 9/11?That somethingwe already known about and in my opinionit hard to make a strong case for the photo alone that the governor knew.? A Democratic assemblyman who refused to discuss impeachment publicly confirmed a Friday morning NBC New York report that legislative staffers have begun researching the impeachment process. No governor in the state has been impeached before. The process would have to start in the Assembly. Earlier this week, the liberal group NJ Working Families called forChristie impeachment. Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto, who would make the call to begin the proceedings, said through a spokesman he ?won't be commenting on the trial until it's completed and all evidence has been presented.? Still, even if the Assembly votes by a simple majority to initiate impeachment, it would then have to be tried in the Senate. Removing Christie from office would require a two-thirds majority there, which Democratsdon have on their own. That could be complicated by the fact that Senate President Stephen Sweeney, under the state constitution, would not be allowed to participate in the trial ? a vestige of NewJersey pre-lieutenant governor system when the Senate president was next in line for the governorship. Montclair State political science professor Brigid Harrison, who recently penned an op-ed that upped the intensity of impeachment talk, said that her interpretation of the constitution is that the Senate president would still be able to vote, though it might require some legal interpretation. The constitution states that the Senate trial would be presided over by the chief justice of the state Supreme Court and that ?the President of the Senate shall not participate in the trial.? If Sweeney could not vote and the remaining 23 Senate Democrats were in lock step in favor of impeachment, at least four Republicans would have to join them to successfully remove Christie from office. Barring damning new evidence,it hard to see Senate Republicans going that way. The governor has had tremendous sway over the votes of GOP lawmakers. Only once have enough Senate Republicans joined Democrats to vote to overrideChristie veto of a piece of legislation, despite dozens of attempts. State Senate Republican Leader Tom Kean Jr. did not return a call seeking comment. It's also far from certain that Senate Democrats would vote in lock step to remove Christie from office. South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross, a close ally of Gov. Chris Christie, is the political benefactor for several of them, including Sweeney. Other Democratic senators have been staunch Christie allies, and one, Sandra Cunningham, is a personal friend. And Christie is close with Essex County Executive Joseph DiVincenzo, whose deputy chief of staff is Democratic state Sen. Teresa Ruiz. Democrats would also be creating a political obstacle for themselves through impeachment.Christie popularity is mired at 26 percent, making him one of the least popular governors in the nation.He so disliked in New Jersey that Democrats are considered near shoo-ins to win the governorship in 2017. Handing thegovernor office to Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, who is already laying the groundwork for a run in 2017, would not only give her the power of incumbency, but a potential easy way to make a fresh start while distancing herself from Christie. ?It?s easier to run againstChristie legacy than it would be to run against Guadagno,? Harrison said. Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray said Wisniewski, who's considering a run for governor, may benefit from impeachment. But it's far from certain other hopefuls, like Sweeney, would welcome it. ""There?s too many gubernatorial wannabees thatdon want to deal with an impeachment and, two, an incumbent Kim Guadgano as their opponent,"" Murray said. ?The politics of it ? there are too many people who have more to lose from that spectacle for a variety of reasons.""",0.036777582999999996,0.012259194,0.008756567,0.033274956,0.050788090999999994,0.315236427,0.0,2,-1,1
"BREAKING: Ted Cruz ENDORSES Donald Trump? Texas Senator Ted Cruz recognizes that 2016 is not his year. Despite giving a valiant effort, his presidential campaign ultimately succumbed to populist appeal and the ever-increasing burden of slander. Because of this, the principled lawmaker ruffled GOP feathers when at the RNC convention, he urged people to vote their conscience and noticeably refrained from offering an endorsement of Donald Trump, the perpetrator of the slander on the campaign trail. For this, Cruz was vilified by many who seemingly never stopped and questioned why when Cruz urged voting for a true conservative, they assumed he was not speaking about the chosen candidate, Trump. After the dust settled, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus stated that those who have not endorsed the Republican nominee may find themselves bereft of GOP support in the future if they intend to mount another presidential run ? a run that is highly likely for Cruz. Because of this pressure, Cruz relented to the power of the GOP and offered his endorsement of Trump on Friday, explaining six policy points guiding his decision in a Facebook post. Check it out: This election is unlike any other in ournation history. Like many other voters, I have struggled to determine the right course of action in this general election. In Cleveland, I urged voters, ?please,don stay home in November. Stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket whom you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution.? After many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump.I made this decision for two reasons. First, last year, I promised to support the Republican nominee. And I intend to keep my word. Second, even though I have had areas of significant disagreement with our nominee, by any measure Hillary Clinton is wholly unacceptable ?that why I have always been #NeverHillary. Six key policy differences inform my decision. First, and most important, the Supreme Court. For anyone concerned about the Bill of Rights ? free speech, religious liberty, the Second Amendment ? the Court hangs in the balance. I have spent my professional career fighting before the Court to defend the Constitution. We are only one justice away from losing our most basic rights, and the next president will appoint as many as four new justices. We know, without a doubt, that every Clinton appointee would be a left-wing ideologue. Trump, in contrast, has promised to appoint justices ?in the mold of Scalia.? For some time, I have been seeking greater specificity on this issue, and today the Trump campaign provided that, releasing a very strong list of potential Supreme Court nominees ? including Sen. Mike Lee, who would make an extraordinary justice ? and making an explicit commitment to nominate only from that list. This commitment matters, and it provides a serious reason for voters to choose to support Trump. Second, Obamacare. The failed healthcare law is hurting millions of Americans. If Republicans hold Congress, leadership has committed to passing legislation repealing Obamacare. Clinton, we know beyond a shadow of doubt, would veto that legislation. Trump has said he would sign it. ? 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now Third, energy. Clinton would continue the Obamaadministration war on coal and relentless efforts to crush the oil and gas industry. Trump has said he will reduce regulations and allow the blossoming American energy renaissance to create millions of new high-paying jobs. Fourth, immigration. Clinton would continue and even expand PresidentObama lawless executive amnesty. Trump has promised that he would revoke those illegal executive orders. Fifth, national security. Clinton would continue the Obamaadministration willful blindness to radical Islamic terrorism. She would continue importing Middle Eastern refugees whom the FBI cannot vet to make sure they are not terrorists. Trump has promised to stop the deluge of unvetted refugees. Sixth, Internet freedom. Clinton supportsObama plan to hand over control of the Internet to an international community of stakeholders, including Russia, China, and Iran. Just this week, Trump came out strongly against that plan, and in support of free speech online. These are six vital issues where the candidates? positions present a clear choice for the American people. If Clinton wins, we know ? with 100% certainty ? that she would deliver on her left-wing promises, with devastating results for our country. My conscience tells me I must do whatever I can to stop that. We also have seen, over the past few weeks and months, a Trump campaign focusing more and more on freedom ? including emphasizing school choice and the power of economic growth to lift African-Americans and Hispanics to prosperity. Finally, after eight years of a lawless Obama administration, targeting and persecuting those disfavored by the administration, fidelity to the rule of law has never been more important. The Supreme Court will be critical in preserving the rule of law. And, if the next administration fails to honor the Constitution and Bill of Rights, then I hope that Republicans and Democrats will stand united in protecting our fundamental liberties. Our country is in crisis. Hillary Clinton is manifestly unfit to be president, and her policies would harm millions of Americans. And Donald Trump is the only thing standing in her way. A year ago, I pledged to endorse the Republican nominee, and I am honoring that commitment. And if youdon want to see a Hillary Clinton presidency, I encourage you to vote for him.I not sure that I buy thatCruz endorsement is entirely voluntary, but the fact remains thathe right. Since the time on the campaign trail,Trump campaign has become more serious and his policy outlines are more articulated. Still, it would have been nice if Trump had explained his ideas in the primary. Instead, what we got was slander and shady smears.",0.014824798,0.010781671000000001,0.010781671000000001,0.022911051,0.039083558,0.32075471699999997,0.008086253,2,-1,1
"Story highlights Reid has launched many attacks against Trump He previously said the GOP nominee was a ""con"" Washington (CNN) Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid called Donald Trump a racist on the Senate floor Monday, an escalation in the Nevada lawmaker's war of words against the GOP presidential nominee in recent weeks. ""Donald Trump is a racist,"" he said. Reid's direct comment goes further than the retiring five-term senator was willing to ten days ago during an interview with CNN's Manu Raju. When asked then if he thought Trump is a racist, Reid responded: ""All you guys have a job to do. You make that decision. I'm not going to."" Previously, Reid excoriated Trump from the Senate floor, calling him a ""spoiled brat,"" ""a con artist"" and a ""human leech who will bleed the country."" And at a September 13 news conference Reid ripped Trump for being overweight and over his eating habits, charging that the media ""magnified"" Hillary Clinton's recent bout with pneumonia.

"Getty Images Fourth Estate In Defense of ?He Said/She Said? Journalism Why we must give the devil his due. The ?he said/she said? method ofreporting which journalists observe theprofession convention and get at least two sides of everystory been taking it on the chin ever since New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen placed it in his gunsights in 2009 and started ack-acking it with regularity. But the ""he said/she said"" debatedidn move from the margins to the mainstream until last week when the New York Times abandoned mechanical balance and published a Page One, above-the-fold piece by Michael Barbaro, shredding Donald Trump as a pitiful serial liar and obfuscator for his latest birtherdeclaration. The Times piece elated critics of the ""he said/she"" said construct. In an Atlantic piece titled ?The Death of ?He Said, She Said? Journalism,? Peter Beinart pronouncedBarbaro work a journalistic sea change. Trump had broken all the rules of political conduct, Beinart stated, and the Times had rightly ditched a few of its own. Abandoning the usual journalistic etiquette, which calls for mendacious politicians to be described as committing a falsehood when whatthey actually doing is lying, the Times piece dealt with Trump with ?astonishing bluntness,? Beinart wrote, repeatedly callingTrump birther nonsense a ?lie.? Trump was given no opportunity in the piece to deny the charges, which sits just fine with the ""he said/she said"" critics. Story Continued Below While I consider Trump to be a first-rate liar anddon mind saying so,I not convinced that jettisoning the ""he said/she said"" blueprint is such a good idea. Every politician lies. If we were to police all politicians in the news pages the way Barbaro did Trump, it would be entertaining. But political journalism as we know it could expire as profiles and news stories collapsed into spreadsheets grading the truth value of political utterances.Isn that what the fact-checker columns are for? In his widely applauded critiques of ""he said/she said"" journalism, Rosen holds that by reflexively seeking the ?other side? of every public dispute and shying away from expressing the truth, the media creates a bogus symmetry between the ?he said? voices in a story and the prevaricators serving up the ?she said? dissent. ?Do users really want to be left helpless in sorting outwho faking it more?? Rosen asked, proposing that journalists put a higher premium on seeking truth and avoiding distortion. The ""he said/she said"" structure constitutes ?one of the lowest forms of journalism in existence,? he would later remark. Donald Trump, the thinking goes, has gamed the ""he said/she said"" convention to contaminate the political debate with his lies, obfuscations and double-talk whenever the press seeks comment on an issue, a clarification of somethinghe said, or a response to a point raised by his opponent, Hillary Clinton. This is true. In speeches and interviews,he expressed a broadband stream of lies, such as denying thathe used terms like ?fat pig? to describe women, insisting that he never called George W. Bush a liar, claiming that he opposed the Iraq War, making fallacious boasts about his acts of philanthropy, asserting that the NFL had contacted him about the debate schedule, and more, much more. But they are lies, all lies. And every time the media quotes one ofTrump ?she said? lies without a correcting fact-check, it undermines the truth of the ?he said? side of the debate. At least, so the thinking goes. But has journalists' practice of giving Trump the right of reply, allowing him to pearl his lies with another coating of deceit really been such a disaster? One result of the straight, ""he said/she said"" coverage of the Trump style has been his record lows in the Washington Post/ABC News favorability poll. Thanks to this coverage, many voters are able to see throughTrump ?post-truth? style of politics anddon need the news pages directly calling him a lying liar who lies every time he speaks. Among his supporters, manydon care that he mangles the facts and others take secret glee in thetrickster campaignhe waging for the presidency:He serving baloney and his supporterscan get enough of it. As bracing and as full of truth-telling as the Barbaro piece was, I hope itdoesn embolden other news pages to abandon convention. The formula, when properly executed, forces reporters to perform due diligence in their articles. The form is even more useful for skeptical ?show me? readers, who want those extra bits of evidence to help them make up their mind about a candidate or an issue. This, I realize, can be especially challenging with Trump because the Mouth of Manhattan has made a career of taking both sides on nearly everything. He is the hermaphrodite of opinionmakers ""he said and she said""?and, like any good circus freak, that makes him too exceptional to build rules from. One reason I admire ""he said/she said"" journalism is that I often find myself sympathizing with the ""she-said"" side of the equation, and its presence assures me that the reporter is conducting something approximating an open inquiry. Whenever the ""she-said"" component of a story goes missing, leaving only the dominant position expressed, I get the feelingI being fed bunk. Even the Holy Bible gives Satan a forum for his dastardly views. So why not news stories? Idon believe a story must balance out like a chemistry equation until both sides (or multiple sides) hover in the ether in perfect equilibrium. But intellectual history informs us that the dominant positions in anyfield paradigms, if youdon mind thelanguage a tendency to erode over time when exposed to minority critiques. In order for thought to progress, the minorityreport seeminglymisguided be heard. The history of science is pockmarked with paradigms that were blown away by she-saiders. Early in the last century, for example, the scientific and cultural elites espoused the misguided philosophy of eugenics, which held that feeblemindedness was directly inheritable and that forced sterilization, institutionalization or lobotomization for these lessers was right and just. To oppose eugenics was to place yourself outside the established consensus, to define yourself as a crackpot, to be reduced to a ""she-said"" if you were lucky enough to get quoted in a news story. Today, we think of the eugenicists as troglodytes. Or consider the story of Alfred Wegener. He 1912, he proposed his plate tectonic theory much to the derision of the scientific establishment who laughed at the idea of continental drift. Not until the 1960s did his ideas gain proper respect, and his critics take his place asgeology crackpots. Or take the example of Australian doctor Barry Marshall, who conjectured in the early 1980s that bacteria and not stress was the cause of ulcers, a condition that afflicted up to 10 percent of all adults. Even after Marshall induced an ulcer in his own stomach by drinking a potion containing Helicobacter pylori he was still derided and marginalized by the establishment. ?You think, ?It?s science;it got to be accepted,?? Marshall told Discover magazine. ?Butit not an absolute given.? By the mid-1990s, the idea finally took root, undermining the business model of thousands of gastroenterologists who treated and retreated the affliction with ineffective drugs and surgery. In 2005, Marshall and a colleague were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for their Helicobacter pylori work. Science abounds with equally dramatic stories. Obviously, the critiques of every she-saiderdon automatically end in the triumphs Wegener and Marshall enjoyed. But when you catalog the ruling paradigms in science and technology that have been toppled in recent years, the toppler was almost always marginalized in the early going. Fracking has all but destroyed the peak oil hypothesis. The ?one-size, fits all? advice on mammograms has been abandoned. Our views on saturated fat, once almost holy writ, have been chucked. Until 1973, the American Psychiatric Association classified homosexuality as a mental disorder. (All is not progress: Some now argue that homophobiais an indicator of a disorder.) Marijuana makes you mad. (Today, the equally suspicious paradigm is that marijuana is good for whatever ails you.) Coffee, once thought to be bad for you, turns out to be good for you, at least for now. Moving over to the policy realm, the once dominant ?super-predator? thesis was once supported across partisan lines. It is now discredited. Remember howJapan economy was supposed to overtake the United States?? Remember how Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said the U.S. economic system was stable? Experts predicted wild inflation after quantitative easing. Others posited that housing prices would never decline nationwide. And so on. The dissents of the she-saiders are generally beneficial. Whether right or wrong, the dissenters have a way of increasingeverybody knowledge. If they are wrong, as Michael Shermer has written, their untruths force the dominant paradigm to self-examine, and if warranted, use new evidence to improve its position. If the she-saiders are right, they advance human thought.That how science works, and I believe journalism should work that way, too. Vaccine pioneer Jonas Salk summarized the predictable moves of the knee-jerk paradigm-defenders with this progression. ?First,? Salk writes, they say ?that itcan be true.? Second phase: ?Well, ifit true,it not very important.? Third phase: ?Well,we known it all along.? Before anybody puts words in my mouth, this is not my long-winded way of saying Idon subscribe to the global warming hypothesis. Ido at the same time, I keep my options open. The protectors of the ruling paradigm have an intellectual responsibility to mount disciplined defense against all comers. Even against crackpots. The last and best reason for supporting ?he said/she said? journalism: So many readers and viewers have self-segregated by limiting their news consumption to outlets that reflect their personal views. These days, many readers get only the ""he said"" side of the story or just the ""she said"" side, remaining deliberately oblivious to the vibrant debate that might actually be going on. While I value partisan media, I also value nonpartisan newsoperationsPOLITICO make ideas duel in their news pages. NPR News Director Michael Oreskes puts this practical spin on why his organization shies away from calling liars liars: ?[I]f you present the facts calmly and without a tone of editorializing, you substantially increase the chance that people will hear you out and weigh the facts. That is why the tone of journalism matters so much. We need potential listeners and readers to believe we are presenting the facts honestly, and not to confirm our opinions.? Ifyou not getting a steady diet of ""she said"" quotations in your news consumption,you at risk of starving to death. ""He said/she said"" keeps journalists honest, even if, on occasion, it looks likeit only accruing to the benefit of a beast like Donald Trump. ****** A sumptuous meal of news, news, news.

"Off Message Is Donald Trump qualified to be president? In the most pivotal moment of 2016, these are the questions he must answer. H.L. Mencken declared there was only one way to look at a politician ? ?down.? Likewise,there really only one way to look at the first presidential debate on Monday: as the first serious job interview for potential President Donald John Trump ? an opaque candidate who has hidden behind a steel curtain of one-liners, faux familiarity and universal celebrity. Story Continued Below Yeah, yeah, yeah,it a big night for Hillary Clinton too.She got a lot to prove, for real, namely thatshe not the lying, self-dealing crook many Americans think she is ? or at least convince the 55 percent of voters whodon like her that her virtues (temperament and experience) compensate for decades of assorted ick. She needs to prove she can stand up to Trump, answer the usual email/foundation questions, convincewhoever still sellable on the idea (stop Instagramming a picture of your lunch, millennials, and listen up) thatshe not some scheming granny who will just sell everybody out the second John Roberts drops the swearing-in Bible. But the spotlight belongs on Trump, who is in need of a rigorous job interview. Clinton deserves the same, but she is already the single most scrutinized, parsed, vetted, investigated, attacked and plaudited non-incumbent to ever seek the presidency.She been around forever, making enemies since the internet was dial-up, cell phones were the size of skateboards and Trump was engaged to Marla Maples. Everyone makes the orange jokes, but Trump is something of a black box ? running on a few big and broad ideas (curbing illegal immigration, ditching bad trade deals, restoring American prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness).He bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a D student whodoesn read books, has the sketchiest sense of history,doesn read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters,can even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing. These are not nasty, biased, liberal opinions. They are facts based on reporting andTrump own public performances. Here are five questions Trump needs to address on Monday ? but taken together, they add up to one big one: Is Donald Trump qualified to be President of the United States? 1. Does he actually know ? or care to know ? the basic information needed to competently run the country? Only one verdict of presidential fitness counts, of course, andthat acandidate capacity to get to 270 electoral votes. In recent days, Trump ? who swooned afterClinton superb convention in Philly ? has closed to within the margin of error in many (though not all) national polls, and jumped to serious leads in battlegrounds like Ohio and Iowa since Aug. 1.He still the most unpopular candidate in recent history (although Clinton is number two with a bullet) and seems to have a ceiling of between 40 and 44 percent nationally. But he can win. Fivethirtyeight.com, the arch-aggregator, gives Trump nearly a 50 percent chance of prevailing. His resurgence proves three political points ? two of them we knew, the third is a surprise to everyone except Trump and his team: The country (especially the white working-class parts) is pissed, Clinton is a perennially lousy candidate and ? lastly, but not leastly ? Trump has proven to be a resilient and flexible candidate with the capacity (developed late in the game) to shift shape and shut up when he needs to. The first debate should be a pivot ? from politicking to president-ing. Being a cunning candidateisn remotely the same thing as being ready to rule ? and we should be moving to the Doris Kearns Goodwin phase of the campaign, where the top priority is fitness to govern in a time of trial. It probablywon happen, but a boy can dream. This is not to suggest that Trumpcan do the job (Ronald Reagan, another entertainer who forayed into politics, was mostly a success), buthe been judged as a performer up to this point, and not subjected to the cold fluorescent scrutiny of managerial competence. Trump has repeatedly flubbed tests of his basic understanding of domestic and foreign affairs ? apparently hewasn aware Russia had annexed Crimea until George Stephanopoulos informed him recently. He obliterated Jeb Bush, that humbled patsy of the GOP establishment, in the debates ? but Bush (if anyone had cared to listen) puncturedTrump bully-boy promise to impose tariffs on Chinese products, correctly pointing out that such a move would certainly spark countermeasures by Beijing that could lead to a global depression. Trumpwasn aware of that fact, or justdidn care. The caring part is kind of important, if history is any guide. In April, I sat down with one of his longtime advisers, Roger Stone, who described what it was like to brief an executive whose prime attributes were supreme self-confidence and supreme impatience. ?All you can do is present information and let him either assimilate it or not,? said Stone, who has known the GOP nominee for decades. ?When you write something for him, keep it short and staccato. He's not going to read a 40-page white paper on the economy; zero chance of that. It's just too boring. Don't blame him; I don't like it either. So keep it simple and direct because that's the way he communicates.? Stone argued that Trumpisn an ignoramus ? just a cut-to-the-chase decision-maker who is a lightning-quick study. But George W.Bush advisers, speaking to biographer Peter Baker, said thatBush unwillingness to ask probing, informed questions led to some of his disastrous decisions in Iraq. And during the nadir of the 2009 global economic meltdown, President Obama added a daily economic briefing to his daily national security rundown to keep tabs on the rapidly shifting metrics of crisis.Trump capacity to intuitively assimilate information might render such processes useless ? butthere not a single presidential historian drawing oxygen who believes a lack of intellectual curiosity is an asset for the job. Many Americans might not give a damn that he knows whatHUD Section 8 program is ? and his failure to answer informational questions that Clinton would parry with ease will endear him to his screw-the-media base. Butdon people have the right to know what he actually knows? Trump has gleefully trashed the rules of presidential campaigns, so why should a moderator treat him with the deference of someone who abides by the norms ? by assuming he possesses the basic knowledge traditionally required of a presidential candidate? 2. Does Trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of American Constitutional government? Again, this is not a given. Hillary Clinton despises the press, and dodges them as if they were a pack of feral rats, but she has never suggested they be stopped from doing their jobs through the courts. Trump (who banned news outlets, including this one, from his events for most of the campaign) routinely threatens litigation against publications that publish unflattering articles and, in February, went so far as to say: ?We're going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace ? we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they're totally protected.?That a new one for a presidential nominee. As Corey Brettschneider wrote in POLITICO Magazine last month: ?For more than 50 years, the Supreme Court has held that for a public figure to prove libel against a news outlet, they must show that the outlet acted with ?actual malice? ? that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.? During a private meeting with Hill Republicans earlier this year, the populist real estate developer expressed his fondness for ?Article 12 of the Constitution.? The framers stopped at seven. ?He was just listing out numbers,? said Congressman Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), a Trump backer at the time. ?I think he was confusing Articles and Amendments.? OK,let write that one off as a gotcha ? you can understand Constitutional principles without citing literal chapter and verse. But consider his reaction to the Paris bombings last November when Trump told FOX News he thought the government should shutter some mosques where ?some bad things are happening.? The comment was decried by Constitutional scholars of all stripes as a radical measure that would violate the ?Free Exercise? clause of the First Amendment, a pillar of protection for faiths of all kinds. 3. Whywon Trump forthrightly answer the most basic questions about his businesses and debts? Hillary Clinton has, appropriately, has come under intense scrutiny for her six-figure speeches to big Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs ? and has refused to release the transcripts of her prattles to the plutocrats. And serious questions remain about the lack of boundaries between the Clinton Foundation, the State Department, and big-money foreign donors who blurred the line between influence peddling and altruism. But the Clintons have released all of their tax returns (in part because, for many years, they were required to do so as government employees) and Trump is the first major presidential candidate in the modern era to thumb his nose at handing over a single one. Why does it matter? Because a guy whose purchase on the presidency is rooted in his private-sector acumen needs to back up his claims with proof, in the same way that Clinton needs to be held accountable for her purported record of accomplishment in the White House, Senate and State Department. At issue isTrump fundamental personal narrative, and his claim thathe ?very, very rich.? He is, but maybe not quite as much as he claims (he sayshe good for $11 billion; Forbes and other outlets sayhe worth less than half that much). More serious is the issue ofTrump debts: The Clinton campaign, citing press reports that he owes large sums to overseas creditors in China and elsewhere, has attacked him for being in the pocket of foreign financial overlords. Ifthat a lie,there an easy way to prove it ? by releasing the returns. Thisisn a liberal media witch-hunt: Many Republicans, including supporters like House Speaker Paul Ryan, say he needs to cough them up, and fast. 4.What the deal with his charitable foundation? Thenthere the matter ofTrump sloppily run, and less-than-magnanimous foundation. In expos? after expos?, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold has reported on a pattern of over-promising donations and the misuse of funds (including a quarter-million payment to cover legal fees forTrump businesses and sports memorabilia) that Trump himself has conceded might be illegal. The problem, yet again, is that Trump has refused to release a comprehensive accounting of his giving, and his surrogates have routinely misstated the magnitude of his generosity, according to the reporting of Fahrenthold and others. 5. Why lie? These days, the polygraph is used sparingly as part of the vetting process for employment, mostly for sensitive national security or law enforcement jobs. If presidential candidates were subjected to that level of scrutiny, the only person allowed on the debate stage at Hofstra would be the technician testing the sound system. But if Trump is to be vetted for the presidency, he needs to be asked not only about individual statementshe made in the past, but his pattern of lying, stretching the truth and bungling facts. Hillary Clinton (?Crooked Hillary? inTrump parlance) it bears repeating, is no saint ? far from it ? and her early answers on the email scandal were misleading, bordering on the untruthful, and flat-out lies in the view of GOP congressional investigators. Butit a crowning irony of 2016 that the Republican Party, whose base revolted against its leadership for untruthfulness ? especially George W.Bush claims about Iraq ? would nominate the most brazenly truth-challenged candidate in recent history. (A recitation ofTrump whoppers would take up too much space ? readPOLITICO comprehensive ?DonaldTrump Week of Misrepresentations, Exaggerations and Half-Truths? for a taste.) In an attempt to defend Trump, buddy Newt Gingrich, who lobbied to beTrump running mate, tweeted what amounted to an indirect admission that his man has a trouble with all those pesky facts. ?Clinton,? the former speaker wrote, ?is a fox who knows many things you can fact check. Trump is a hedgehog who knows one big thing?? But getting the facts right ? and telling the truth ? is a big thing.It the only way citizens will ever look up to, and not down on, their leaders.",0.022803487999999997,0.008718980999999999,0.010731053,0.011401743999999998,0.052313883,0.286384977,0.002012072,2,-1,1

Trump ignored reporters' questions during a stop at a restaurant here, the first opportunity journalists covering his campaign have had to ask the Republican nominee about his reversal on the issue. In a brief statement on Friday, Trump asserted that he now believed Obama was born in the US and then refused to answer reporters' questions after the press event, which campaign aides told media members would be a press conference.

"A liberal attempt to revive the so-called public option ? a government-run insurance plan to shore up gaps in the Affordable Care Act ? is opening old wounds between the DemocraticParty liberal and moderate wings. Thirty-three mostly liberal Democrats, including all the Senate leadership, have signed onto a nonbinding Senate resolution introduced last Friday to add the public option to Obamacare, arguing that it is needed to fix problems with thepresident signature health care law. Story Continued Below But missing from the list are vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine and a half-dozen other moderates who face reelection in 2018 ? when the map that favors Democrats this year will flip to favor Republicans.Kaine absence is especially striking since Hillary Clinton embraced the public option in July. A campaign spokesperson said Kaine is ?supportive of a workable public option for health care insurance,? even though he has not co-sponsored the resolution. But other moderate Democratic senators made it clear that they remain uncomfortable with a government-run health program. Sen. Jon Tester, a moderate Montana Democrat up for reelection in 2018, said the focus should be on working ?on a bipartisan basis to fix Obamacare.? ?Until we get to the point thatwe willing to work together on that ?we going to continue to see problems,? Tester said. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), who won her 2012 election with 50.24 percent of the vote and is expected to face a tight race in 2018, called the public-option debate a ?distraction.? ?We?ve had a whole lot of discussion aboutwhat going to happen to Obamacare but ? wearen having discussions [about how we deliver higher-quality care at lower costs] because we keep discussing howwe going to fund it,? she said. The resistance of moderate Democrats led to the scuttling of the public option when it was first debated as a potential part of the ACA in 2009. Now, the continued divide between liberals and moderates could be a preview of coming battles if Clinton were to become president and liberals mounted a serious effort to add a public option to Obamacare. Since the ACA was conceived, liberals have insisted that a government-run health insurer would pressure private insurers to reduce premiums. Now, progressives say, many of theACA flaws could be repaired with a public option, which would essentially be a new plan offered on the Obamacare insurance exchanges, some of which are down to only one or two private insurers. Clinton has repeatedly said on the campaign trail that she would defendthe Affordable Care Act if elected president. Her campaign website pledges that she will ?build on its success to bring the promise of affordable health care to more people and make a ?public option? possible.? Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), who is spearheading the effort, said that besidesClinton endorsement, rising premiums and the high-profile withdrawal of Aetna and United Healthcare from several exchanges makes the issue ripe for discussion. ?We?re right in the middle of the presidential campaign, and I thinkit important during this campaign and [House and Senate races] to have a conversation about having competition in all the exchanges across the country,? Merkley said. He downplayed the lack of support from moderates and said he has not run the resolution by the Clinton campaign. He pointed out that all of the Democratic leaders have signed on as cosponsors. ?So there is a wide range of folks ? folks from states that have big insurance companies? headquarters, like Connecticut ? folks whodon.It a broad spectrum,? he said. ?We?re only a couple days into this.? Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is championing the resolution, said the goal is to build momentum to enact a public option next year. Green saidhe happy with 33 co-sponsors so far and hopeful that moderate lawmakers from rural states are drawn to the idea of more competition among insurers. ?Rural states have big problems with competition, and having a public option would actually be really popular in those states,? he said. But some red-state Democrats are skeptical. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), who is also due to face voters in 2018, saidshe open to discussing the public option ?but I want to make sure thatwe done everything to make the market work before we turn to that.? Republicans are already trying to frame the public option as ?more Obamacare,? a preview of the battle that could come if Democrats are in a position to pursue the proposal. ?Democrats actually introduced legislation last week calling for Obamacare 2.0, a new government-run health plan,?

Pence's comments came on the heels of a radio interview with Rush Limbaugh in which Pence said Clinton is oblivious to the threats posed by terrorism and complicit in weakening U.S. law enforcement. ?I?m not sure that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama know thatwe at war,? Pence said. He went on to blame Democrats for a ?culture of political correctness that is tying the hands of law enforcement here at home.? Pence spoke to Limbaugh on the phone from his plane on the tarmac in Mason City, Iowa, where he's appearing at a town hall event ahead of a rally in Dubuque. He also slammed White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest for suggesting that the US and ISIL are engaged in a ?narrative fight? and took issue withClinton statement earlier Monday that DonaldTrump fiery rhetoric aids ISIL. ?The only thing that gives comfort to our adversaries is weakness,? Pence said. The Saturday explosions in New Jersey and New York appear to be unrelated to the Minnesota attack, officials say. The Minnesota assailant stabbed nine people before being killed by police. ISIL has taken responsibility for the attack. The Saturday night bombing in New York wounded 29 people, while the earlier explosion in New Jersey before a charity race caused no injuries. An Afghan immigrant believed to be tied to the bombings was arrested in New Jersey on Monday after a gunfight with police. ?We are at war with radical Islamic terrorism,? Pence told Limbaugh. ?We are at war with the ISIS caliphate.?",0.052924791,0.008356546,0.0,0.016713092,0.06406685200000001,0.289693593,0.025069637999999998,2,-1,1

"DISGRACEFUL: Wal-Mart Employee Refuses To Decorate Pro-Cop Cake Because ?That?s Racist? A McDonough, Georgia Wal-Mart employee refused to make a Thin Blue Line cake for anofficer retirement party and it sparked an online firestorm.

Below is an example: But itwasn the ease of the cake design that kept the bakers from fulfilling the order, it was the fact that ?some could perceive it as racist.? The customer, theofficer daughter, then thought she could receive a more favorable answer by asking for just a thin blue line on a chocolate background, but the baker said shewasn comfortable doing that either. Confused by the resistance to make such a cake, the daughter asked the baker, ?Is there something wrong with cops??

The family here did what everyone should do and they moved on to another bakery that made the cake without objection.

"Eastern Aleppo saw what witnesses describe as an unprecedented and relentless offensive as United Nations diplomats demanded a halt to the violence Sunday. Interested in Syria? Add Syria as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Syria news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest This morning airstrikes continued to hit the rebel-held part of Aleppo, say locals. ?Six have died at the hospital so far since airstrikes started to hit this morning,? Abu Rajab, a radiologist and managing director of an Aleppo hospital, told ABC News. Sunday's airstrikes were heavier than anything he had seen or heard since the Syrian war started over five years ago, he said. ?It felt as if the ground was shaking under you, like an earthquake,? he said of the strikes. ?The explosions sounded loud and strange, like nothingwe heard before in five years of war. It was a bloody day. No words can describe what happened yesterday.? He said the hospital received about 180 injured people from Sunday's attacks and had to refer some of them to other clinics because itdidn have the capacity to treat all of them. About 40 percent of the wounded were children, and 20 percent were women, he said. The intensive care unit was so filled up with patients that one surgeon had to conduct an operation on a floor. Since midnight Saturday, at least 27 people were killed by strikes from warplanes and government helicopters, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Sunday. At least 70 people have been killed in airstrikes on eastern Aleppo from Friday to Sunday night, activists in Syria told ABC News. The United Nations said the recent attacks on Aleppo could amount to war crimes. ?Repeated airstrikes and the use of bunker-busting and incendiary bombs in densely populated areas could well prove to be war crimes,? David Swanson, a spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told ABC News. The U.N. has 40 trucks with aid ready to enter eastern Aleppo. The aid has been sitting by the Turkey-Syria border for about two weeks and is still waiting at a Syrian customs area. Once the U.N. gets the green light, the first convoy carrying a month's worth of wheat flour for more than 150,000 people will be sent to Aleppo, according to the U.N.?s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The shipment will be followed up by a delivery of enough food rations to feed 35,000 people for a month. The distance from the border to eastern Aleppo is only some 40 miles, but the journey could take about four to five hours. While up to 275,000 people in eastern Aleppo are still waiting for the aid they need, humanitarian assistance entered the four besieged Syrian towns of Madaya, Foah, Zabadani and Kefraya on Sunday. On Wednesday evening, one of two water pumping stations in eastern Aleppo was destroyed by airstrikes. In retaliation, rebels turned off the second water pumping station, which mainly serves the government-held western part of the city. That means that close to 2 million people in Aleppo are living without running water. At an emergency meeting Sunday, Western U.N. diplomats condemned the recent escalating violence in Aleppo and blamed Russia and the Syrian government. Samantha Powers, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., accused Russia of committing barbarism under the guise of counterterrorism. ?Instead of pursuing peace, Russia and [Syrian President Bashar al-]Assad make war. Instead of helping get lifesaving aid to civilians, Russia and Assad are bombing humanitarian convoys, hospitals and first responders who are trying desperately to keep people alive,? Powers told members of the Security Council Sunday. ?It seems the only items that make it into eastern Aleppo these days are barrel bombs and incendiaries that witnesses report seen dropped by Assad's forces and Russian forces. Russia, of course, has long had the power to stop this suffering. Even now, we will continue to look for any way possible to restore the cessation of hostilities.?

"Washington  Kix Brooks, one half of the country music duo Brooks and Dunn, is not buying the gloom and doom expressed on the campaign trail about America's declining greatness -- often espoused by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" ""We've always been great, as far as I'm concerned,"" the country music artist, whose classic 2001 hit ""Only America"" with Ronnie Dunn became an anthem for patriotism following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, told CNN. ""There's a lot of stuff that we can do better and there's a lot of stuff that we do better than anybody in the world, but that's life. That's our project as Americans -- we always work to be better,"" he continued. But Brooks, who considers himself to be ""fairly conservative,"" is not optimistic that the next commander-in-chief will be able to make good on his or her promises to solve some of the country's most divisive issues if Washington remains gridlocked and the US continues to be as ""polarized"" as it is today. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has promised to work with Congress to implement comprehensive immigration reform and pledged to take on the gun lobby to institute ""common sense"" gun-control measures. Meanwhile, Trump has promised to build a wall on the southern border between the US and Mexico. ""I think all the issues that are on the table, from gun control to immigration, are so complicated, there is no easy answer,"" Brooks told CNN. ""None of these problems are going to be solved overnight or probably in the next four years no matter what either candidate says."" On gun culture Lamenting the hostility that has often plagued the gun-control debate on both sides, the ""Boot Scootin' Boogie"" artist said that the right to bear arms is an American principle that ""should be respected."" ""We do have a Second Amendment and it's something that should be respected and discussed in a civilized way,"" Brooks said.

While Americans in rural America ""never considered what a gang was,"" Brooks said, those in urban America also don't understand that ""having a shotgun in the back of your pick up truck was also just a way of life"" for Americans like him. Brooks is a strong supporter of states' rights and said that gun-control solutions to address gang violence and gun violence in American cities are not necessarily needed or effective in rural America. ""I don't feel like what's good for California is good for Tennessee, is good for Louisiana, is good for New York City,"" Brooks said,"" adding, that local ""leaders in our own communities know much better what our problems are and how we should deal with them than Washington, D.C., does."" And as for election 2016, Brooks did not say who he is voting for but said if he hears a candidate speaking along those lines, he tends ""to listen more closely."" On 'Only in America' Many artists have protested when politicians with views they oppose use their songs during campaign events. However, when then-Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama played Brooks and Dunn's ""Only in America"" at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, that was not the case. ""Seems ironic that the same song Bush used at the Republican Convention last election would be used by Obama and the Democrats now,"" Brooks said at the time. ""Very flattering to know our song crossed parties and potentially inspires all Americans."" Brooks, who was a supporter of President George W. Bush, said that he co-wrote ""Only in America"" with his friend and music producer Don Cook -- a Democrat -- after they spent day in the woods, riding four-wheelers near Brooks' farm and talking about how grateful they are to be Americans. ""The song was never meant to be political in any way. It still isn't,"" Brooks said. ""The song is patriotic ...

"The trust issue continues to be the major stumbling block for both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. | Getty Trump, Clinton take aim at trust issues In the days before the debate, the campaigns attempted to stick the liar label to their rival contender. HillaryClinton campaign on Friday held a conference call urging reporters to ?lift up the lies? it expects Donald Trump will tell at Monday's debate. Capitol Hill Republicans leaked news that former Clinton aide Cheryl Mills had been granted partial immunity in theFBI email investigation. Democrats and Republicans alike are aiming to influence the debate before the candidates take the stage, with Clinton officials targetingTrump slipperiness with the facts and Republicans taking aim atClinton struggles with transparency. Story Continued Below And in their own ways, both sides are aiming to make the debate a referendum on which candidate American voters can trust. ?Donald Trump has shown a clear pattern of repeating provably false lies and hoping no one corrects him,?Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement Friday. ?Voters and viewers should keep track: any candidate who tells this many lies clearlycan win the debate on the merits.? The trust issue continues to be the major stumbling block for both candidates. A recent CBS/NYT poll showed that 63 percent of likely voters believe Clinton is not honest or trustworthy, and 60 percent of voters who view Trump as untrustworthy. As a pre-buttal to the debate, the Clinton campaign laid out seven lies that they say Trump should be fact-checked on in real time, including his claim that he has always opposed the war in Iraq (a statement left wholly unchallenged by NBC host Matt Lauer in a presidential forum earlier this month). Meanwhile, Republicans expressed outrage at the latest news from inside theFBI investigation ofClinton email use at the State Department. The immunity deal for Mills and another former Clinton aide, Heather Samuelson, were narrow and covered only their handover of laptops used in 2014 when they were sortingClinton work-related and personal emails. It did not cover any of their statements to the FBI. But that didn't stop the outrage from those trying to prevent Clinton from winning the White House. ?The fact that HillaryClinton top aide and attorney was granted immunity by the FBI is shocking,? RNC chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement. ?We now know itwasn mere IT staffers that were given a pass, but individuals at the highest levels of this dangerous scheme that jeopardized national security.?Trump former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who remains on his campaign's payroll, tweeted; ?Who needs this if NO laws broken?? Clinton campaign officials downplayed the revelation, calling it old information from a closed case that was being leaked for political reasons. ?House Republicans are trying to make something out of nothing by rummaging through the files of a Justice Department investigation that was closed months ago, and leaking selective details three days before the first presidential debate,? said Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon. They predicted the Mills revelation would be a ?non-factor? by Monday night, and noted that cable newswasn even picking up the story on a busy news day filled with cell phone footage of a fatal police shooting in Charlotte, N.C. Some Clinton allies, however, worried that Lewandowskiwasn completely wrong in his assessment -- that the previously undisclosed immunity deal, however narrow, fed into the narrative that the Clintons try to hide information in the hopes of gliding past it. ?How is it not like pneumonia?? said one Clinton ally worried it gave the appearance of wrong-doing. ?It leads to the interference that her top aides needed it. Why did they keep it a secret?? And the ill-timed leak guaranteed that Clinton will not cross the finish line of the election, now just 46 days away, shaking free of the email scandal. ButClinton debate prep team, insiders said, has already been anticipating that Trump will grill her hardest on her emails, and don't expect the tidbit of new information to change the narrative. One longtime Clinton ally familiar with the process said the candidate typically spends most of the time in debate prep ?working and reworking the answers to the difficult questions.? In this case, the ally said, that section would include ?anything to do with the Foundation, anything to do with your illness, and everything to do with your email.?",0.041984732999999996,0.003816794,0.007633588,0.007633588,0.055343511,0.27480916,0.0,2,-1,1
"The Battleground Project Trump puts a boiling battleground in play In pivotal North Carolina, two contentious local issues are overshadowing almost everything else. When Donald Trump took his campaign to High Point, North Carolina, Tuesday, his topics ranged broadly from trade to immigration to terrorism. In other words, none of the hot-button issues that are currently roiling the political landscape in the battleground statethat looking increasingly essential to his hopes of winning. Unlike the presidential contest in nearly every other swing state, NorthCarolina is framed this year by two local battles overshadowing almost everything else. Story Continued Below There is House Bill 2 ? the so-called bathroom bill which has energized young liberals and older conservatives inwhat viewed by many as a battle for the soul of the state. Then there is the furor over voting rights, which has provided Democrats with a major organizational and energy boost among African-Americans. ?The intensity that you see on the national level is on steroids in North Carolina, because not only do you have this presidential race wherethey both here all the time, you also have a highly-chargedgovernor race and Senate race with the issues of HB2 and voting rights litigation all rolled up into one,? explained Bruce Thompson, a Raleigh attorney and a longtime, high-profile Hillary Clinton supporter in the state. ?There cannot be another state that has that kind of intensity. It comes up in every conversation.It not just the insiders talking about it. It comes up on the sidelines of mydaughter field hockey games."" The two issues form a unique backdrop in a place that suddenly occupies a pivotal role on a hardening electoral map. Top Clinton aidescan envision a scenario in which Trump loses North Carolina but wins the White House. In a memo circulated to donors on Monday evening, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook framed thestate 15 electoral votes as something close to a must-win for Trump. The Trump campaign is acting accordingly, with three straight weeks featuring visits to the state from the GOP nominee, including his rally Tuesday. His allies are hoping the polarizing politics surrounding HB2 and roughly 35 legal showdowns in Raleigh this month about voting rights will rally conservatives to his side, putting a GOP-leaning state squarely in his column, and stamping out Democrats' Southern advances in one ofClinton most frequently visited states. Democrats believe the local fireworks provide Clinton with an unprecedented chance to juice up enthusiasm among young voters, college-age whites and African-Americans ? the groupsshe relying on to capture the state. The contentiousgovernor race has set the tone, with GOP Gov. Pat McCrory and Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper locked in a contestthat been so defined byMcCrory signing of HB2 that Democrats have mulled how to saddle Trump with thegovernor baggage ? a twist on the mechanics of the presidential race in other swing states, where Democrats have framed Trump as drag on down-ballot candidates. ?It may be thatwhat keeping North Carolina in play is that Hillary could be gettingCooper coattails,? said one veteran Democratic operative in the state. The Trump campaign did not respond to several requests for comment. The ?bathroom bill? issue ? which is controversial largely because of its provision that individuals may only use government-funded restrooms corresponding to their gender at birth ? has become a defining one for Clinton, whose campaign has made a habit of seizing on local controversies in whichever stateshe visiting since the early days of her primary. North Carolina has seen businesses and some local entertainment staples flee since thebill passage in March, with few departures as politically stinging as the Atlantic CoastConference decision to pull its college football championship game from Charlotte or the NCAA's move to ax seven in-state events ? includingmen basketball tournament games. Wired Magazine this week estimated that the bill had cost North Carolina nearly $400 million already. ""They are huge things that are happening within the state and I think not only is it going to help us,? addedClinton states director, Marlon Marshall. ?It?s going to help Democrats up and down the ticket.? According to an Elon University poll released Tuesday, 60 percent of likely voters said NorthCarolina national reputation is worse as a result of the passage of HB2.Clinton in-state forces have used the headlines to highlight what they say is Republican-led intolerance that has led to economic harm ? a casethat animated the highly educated white voters in the Research Triangle area who could carry her to victory. Speaking last week in Greensboro, where some of the basketball games would usually be played, Clinton hammered the message home: ?Look atwhat happening with the NCAA and the ACC,? she said. ?This is where bigotry leads, and wecan afford it."" The Democratic nominee has also weighed in on the voting rights fightthat been raging since the state implemented rules eliminating same-day registration and requiring an ID in 2013, calling such regulations ?a blast from the Jim Crow past? in early September as she campaigned in Charlotte.Clinton in-state team has four lawyers working on staff to bolster her voter protection program, and Democratic attorneys there have been engaged in thisfall fight since 2014. But the dispute returned to the forefront earlier this month after a series of legal rulings about thestate voting laws ? including one from the Supreme Court that restored one-stop early voting ? pushed the onus onto thestate counties to construct plans for approval by the Republican-led State Board of Elections. Democrats then piled lawyers in to work with the local proposals, guaranteeing they had legal representation in each of the more than 30 counties where there was a fight over the plan. Ensuring that voters can take advantage of one-stop early voting could help Clinton enormously with thestate large population of rural African-Americans who are not registered voters. And it gave the Clinton campaign a chance to rally black voters in the cities around the idea that the restrictions were racially motivated in the first place. ?There will be more early voting in North Carolina than there was in 2012,? explained Marshall, making the case that the very presence of more early voting will be a motivator. ?That?s a way to energize our base, and get them to show up to the polls."" Trump, for his part, has also drilled down on North Carolina. The attention has paid off:He within 1 percentage point of Clinton according to the POLITICO Battleground States polling average. According to the new Elon poll, when including voters leaning toward one of the candidates, Trump and Clinton were deadlocked at 45 percent, with Libertarian Gary Johnson pulling 7 percent of the vote. Unlike Clinton, Trump's focus in North Carolina has been on an anti-trade deal message that especially resonates among older, white working class voters who have lost jobs in industries like textiles. ""Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA, she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, and she supported the job-killing deal with South Korea that she helped to push through,"" he said at his High Point rally.",0.030525031,0.002442002,0.004884005,0.010989011000000002,0.048840049,0.267399267,0.007326007,2,-1,1
"In a perfect democracy, there would be multiple viable parties to choose candidates from. Each one would have to work hard and strive for our vote, and each one would have an equal chance at winning. Unfortunately, because of the way election laws and funding are currently in the United States,we pretty much stuck with a two-party system and any third-party vote goes to help one of the two major parties. Think Ralph Nader in 2000 and how his votes in Florida gave us George W. Bush. Well, Nader and the Supreme Court.It imperfect, but until laws are changed, it is what it is. No amount of whining or sitting elections out is going to change that. What we need are legislators willing to change the laws, butthat never going to happen if people keep having hissy fits. Thisyear election is so critical not just for the nation, but the entire world. A Donald Trump presidency would be catastrophic on so many levels, both with domestic and foreign policy. Reminding everyone how important this election is, and how a third-party vote will give us a President Trump, is none other than the legendary writer/producer and creator of Family Guy, Seth MacFarlane. MacFarlane tweeted: ?Remember: This November you can help elect President Donald Trump just by voting for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein! Happy Election Year!? Remember: This November you can help elect President Donald Trump just by voting for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein! Happy Election Year! ? Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) September 19, 2016 His sarcasm is more a terrifying wake-up call than just witty banter on the Twitter machine. Does this mean youshouldn vote for Stein or Johnson? No, of course not. However, it needs to be brought topeople attention that their vote for a third partyisn actually going to put their candidate into office, but rather have the possibility of ushering in the apocalypse with Trump. A ?conscience vote? does not do anyone any good with a Fascist in the White House, and it goes much deeper than just feeling good about yourself on election day. So, do what you do.That your freedom to do so, but remember the unintended consequences of that vote and what will be in store for the entire world.

But he said we should do it the way Israel does. And, like, every once in while Donald Trump says something right. Because we profile already, we just do it stupidly. All police work is profiling.

"Hollywood loses yet another one of their dearest actresses, and we are heartbroken. She was born in Chicago Illinois on December 27, 1942 and loved by anyone and everyone who came in contact with her. Many of you probably remember the legendary actress as Liesl Von Trapp from ?The Sound of Music.? Charmian Carr definitely left an imprint on Hollywood, and she will never be forgotten. TMZ reported the death of the 73-year-old on Sunday September 18, 2016.Carr rep stated that she died from complications from dementia. Apparently she was battling a rare form of the disease.Carr story was a very unique one, which makes her acting journey so special. At the time that she auditioned for ?The Sound of Music? she was a student at the San Fernando Valley State College. She was studying speech therapy and philosophy, and was also working for a doctor. ?I was going to college and getting extra spending money by modeling in fashion shows in one of the stores. One of the girls who modeled with me knew that Robert Wise, producer-director of The Sound of Music had been conducting a four-month search for someone to play the part of 16-year-old Liesl. My friend, without my knowing it, sent in my picture and explained in a note that I sang and danced. I received a call from Mr. Wise to come for a tryout. It took me completely by surprise?? After completing ?The Sound of Music? and several other acting parts, Carr left her career in acting and pursued another life-long dream of hers. Charmian started her own interior design business ?Charmian Carr Designs? and surprisingly it took off a lot easier than she expected ? especially after being hired by Michael Jackson. Carr married Jay Brent who was a dentist in 1967 and 24 years later the couple got a divorce. They had two beautiful daughters together. She is survived by all of her siblings, her daughters and her grandchildren. She brought joy to everyone around her and even still today she is known and loved by those who watch her shows. Her smile lit up every room she walked into and her positive personality was contagious. Please continue to keep this family in your prayers as they mourn the loss of their loved one. Ican help but watch this over and over and think that there will never be anyone who could replace this woman!

"You?ve got to love Robert Reich. The former Secretary of Labor under future First Lady and former President Bill Clinton met a Trump supporter at a coffee shop andcouldn resist stopping for a moment to ruin the poorguy week by introducing him to a concept that is foreign to him: facts. ?I finally found a Trump supporter ? this morning when I went to buy coffee. (I noticed a Trump bumper sticker on his car.),? Reich writes in a Facebook post that has gone viral since he posted it Monday morning. Then he completely dismantled Trump ? politely ? before theguy very eyes: ?Hi,?

Why are you supporting him?? ?I knowhe a little bit much,? said the Trump supporter. ?Buthe a successful businessman. And we need a successful businessman as president.? ?How do you knowhe a successful businessman?? I asked. ?Becausehe made a fortune.? ?Has he really?? I asked. ?Of course. Forbes magazine sayshe worth four and a half billion.? ?Thatdoesn meanhe been a success,? I said. ?In my book it does,? said the Trump supporter. ?You know, in 1976, when Trump was just starting his career, he said he was worth about $200 million,? I said. ?Most of that was from his father.? ?That just proves my point,? said the Trump supporter. ?He turned that $200 million into four and a half billion. Brilliant man.? ?But if he had just put that $200 million into an index fund and reinvested the dividends,he be worth twelve billion today,? I said.

" STrump number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in thecompany hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA. Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the FirstAmendment protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel andTrump campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that: According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. ?The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,? the lawsuit says. Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republicannominee most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant.Thiel parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but nowhe supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether. Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be HulkHogan secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing thebillionaire then-secret sexual orientation. But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out theGOP bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, ?Every American has a unique identity.I proud to be gay,I proud to be a Republican,? after a lengthy rant against ?government incompetence.? He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period. Unfortunately, his own partydidn pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s. ?Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,? said the Department ofLabor OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. ?Ournation taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.? Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself vigorouslyand denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News. Now, the executive who accused his employer ? the federal government ? of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that hiscompany hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

" The nation's billionaires -- energized by a presidential race heading down to the wire and led to believe that their money can tip the balance -- are digging deep. The investments come as the value of hefty fundraising and television advertising has been thrown into question this year thanks to Donald Trump's largely free-media driven campaign. Meanwhile, the failure of big-money candidates like Jeb Bush and the ability of Bernie Sanders to raise tens of millions of dollars from small donors underscored questions about whether big money packs the same punch this election cycle as it once did. But as Election Day nears, many of the top 1 percent decided they still think their checks matter. ""The fundraisers have been calling for a while. Now we're all kind of settled back in, the summer's over, and you look up and, man, this election's right on top of ya,"" said Steve Mostyn, a Democratic trial lawyer who gave $1 million to Hillary Clinton's super PAC and is prepared to give another $1 million to it before the election wraps. Mostyn, like other donors, said the increasing competitiveness of the presidential and Senate races made him feel he needed to join in. In a non-competitive race, an extra million might just be gravy. So Tom Steyer, the billionaire environmental activist, committed another $15 million to his Democratic super PAC. The Ricketts family of the Midwest -- which financed substantial amounts of the barrage against Donald Trump during the Republican primary -- is now organizing millions to support him. And a batch of out-of-nowhere megadonors -- whether it's pro-Israel philanthropist Cherna Moskowitz on the right or Hollywood filmmaker Thomas Tull on the left ? are leaving their mark. Too much, too late? And TV, or not TV? Yet the biggest givers may have waited too long, depending on how they want to spend their money. With each passing week, the millions have smaller utility as advertising rates spike and early votes are cast. Steyer is an exception, routing his millions to his own personal super PAC, Next Gen Climate Action, along with a super PAC co-run with a labor unions, For our Future. Both of the groups are funneling their money into a field program -- not paid media. ""We believe in the traditional American democratic process where neighbors talk to neighbors about the most important issues affecting their lives,"" Steyer said in a statement to CNN. ""That's something you can't squeeze into a 15 second ad."" The other rising Democratic donor: Moskovitz, who sent ripples through the donor world when he pledged $20 million to a variety of liberal and Democratic Party groups, but didn't give to Clinton TV ad powerhouse Priorities USA. Moskovitz told CNN that he had ""nothing more to announce"" about any potential gift to Priorities. While he is ""primarily focused on the top"" of the ticket, he described Priorities as ""distinguished by focusing on TV more than anything else."" Bloomberg, the former Republican-turned-independent New York City mayor who has endorsed Clinton, does not plan to give to Priorities USA either, according to Howard Wolfson, a Bloomberg political adviser. But he will likely end up spending $15 million for his Independence USA, Wolfson said. The group has already spent in Senate races for Republican incumbent Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania and Democratic challenger Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire, and is assessing whether to air advertisements in other states, Wolfson said. For the GOP, the pro-Trump, Ricketts-led effort, is a bet that TV does indeed work. The Ricketts are donating $1 million to their group, Future 45, and hope to raise a total of $25 million in this campaign's closing weeks. They plan to run ads in six states with competitive Senate races: Florida, Nevada, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Iowa, according to the head of the PAC, Brian Baker. It's unclear how many of the traditional donors that have been allied with the Ricketts family are following them into the fray. Future 45 was dormant for months after Trump won the nomination. Several major donors who have given to Ricketts-led groups in the past did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday about whether they would fund Future 45. Some, like Home Deport founder Bernie Marcus and former US Senate candidate Linda McMahon, are publicly backing Trump and looking for ways to give. Others, like California investor Bill Obendorf and Chicago hedge funder Ken Griffin, are not. Offered a chance to say whether Griffin planned to support the group, a Griffin spokesman declined to comment. John Jordan, a California vinter and large Republican donor who has worked closely with the Ricketts family, said he regarded their political operation as savvy and effective. But he said that the late infusion of cash would have little impact. ""I feel bad for the people who wrote the checks,"" said Jordan. ""You can only spend so much effectively at the last minute."" Adelson's impact The decision by Adelson to partner with the Ricketts operation is a blow to the Trump super PACs that have been trying to land him as a landmark donor. One group, Rebuilding America Now, has secured million-dollar checks from Marcus thanks in part due to the fundraising skills of Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who leads the group. But many other well-heeled Trump supporters are still on the sidelines. Foster Friess, the Wyoming social conservative, told CNN earlier this month that while Scott's ""leadership is reassuring,"" he is not investing his dollars in the super PAC. A second group run by a billionaire family close to Trump, Bob and Rebekah Mercer, appears to be in favor, and they won a new $1 million last month from Moskowitz, a California philanthropist. She did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday about her donation plans. The Adelson's gift to the pro-Trump effort -- likely to be around $5 million -- is substantially smaller than some had hoped, and the decision to relinquish control over their dollars to a separate donor family direct the effort is surprising. Yet some Democrats appear willing to go dollar-for-dollar with their Republican rivals. Mostyn, the Democratic lawyer who is hosting Tim Kaine for a fundraiser later this week in Houston, said he found the donation sizes of Adelson and Ricketts to be underwhelming, but that Trump's recent strength has him more eager to return fundraising calls. ""On my list of things to do today,"" Mostyn said, ""getting back to them has gone way up.""",0.024234693999999998,0.0,0.00127551,0.012755101999999999,0.044642857,0.23852040800000002,0.0063775509999999995,2,-1,1
"Atlanta  Long before New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie ran for president, and later transformed into one of Republican nominee Donald Trump's main supporters on the 2016 campaign trail, he was mired in a political scandal that left its mark on his career: Bridgegate. It's been a few years since the brouhaha over the George Washington Bridge's lane closures rocked the Christie administration. Now, after three years of federal investigations, a couple of indictments and jury selection, the trial of a former aide of New Jersey's governor and one of his longtime political allies will begin this morning in federal court. Though Christie himself has not faced any charges related to this incident -- he's denied all involvement from the onset -- he's expected to remain a key figure in the trial, unable to fully escape scrutiny from a controversy that's overshadowed his second and final term as governor. On Monday, prosecutors said Christie knew of the road closures while they were happening. The allegations came during opening arguments in the case involving Bill Baroni, deputy executive director of the Port Authority, and Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff. In case you forget how Bridgegate all went down -- and what's at stake in the coming weeks -- here's an explanation of how we got to this point. So, what's Bridgegate again? JUST WATCHED 911 audio from bridge scandal released Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 911 audio from bridge scandal released 01:47 In November 2013, Christie won re-election to his second and final gubernatorial term (he's term limited), cruising to a decisive victory fueled in part by his strong showing of leadership in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. Despite his popularity at the time, not everyone endorsed the Republican, who needed bipartisan backing in a blue state. Mark Sokolich, the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, was among the politicians who didn't support the incumbent governor. The following September, on the first day of the school year, Port Authority officials abruptly shut down some of the traffic lanes on the New Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge, drawing the ire of motorists. Initially, Christie's administration characterized the closures as a part of a traffic study. Later on, though, Port Authority officials testified that no such study ever happened. One month before the lane closure, with Christie's re-election campaign in full swing, and Kelly texted David Wildstein, a former Port Authority official and a political ally of Christie: ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee."" ""Got it,"" Wildstein replied. The messages, contrary to the Christie administration's spin that chalked it up to ineffective bureaucracy, offered evidence that the closures were an act of political vengeance, according to federal prosecutors. ""They agreed to and did use public resources to carry out a vendetta and exact retribution,"" US Attorney for New Jersey Paul Fishman said in May 2015. Who was charged in Bridgegate?

She's now Christie's incoming chief of staff and has also been subpoenaed by the state Assembly committee. Hide Caption 21 of 21 Bill Baroni, deputy executive director of the Port Authority and Kelly were indicted on numerous conspiracy and fraud charges in May 2015. Wildstein avoided trial by pleading guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation. The Bridgegate charges stem from a series of damning emails and texts made public in January 2014. In response to the charges, Kelly chalked up her correspondence with Wildstein to ""sarcasm and humor."" Then, she lambasted Wildstein for lying about her involvement in order to get himself a plea deal. What about Christie? New Jersey Governor Chris Christie reacts to a question during a news conference in Trenton, New Jersey March 28, 2014. Those facing charges had clear and direct ties to Christie. However, the governor has not faced charges and he has maintained he had no knowledge of the lane closures, denying any wrongdoing. Shortly after the texts surfaced, Christie fired Kelly, noting that he felt ""embarrassed and humiliated"" by the ""abject stupidity"" of her actions. Two months after those emails went public, lawyers retained by Christie's office released a Bridgegate report that exonerated Christie. ""It's a search for the truth and we believe we have gotten to the truth,"" former federal prosecutor Randy Mastro, whose law firm produced the Bridgegate report, told NJ.com in 2014 upon its release.

However, he didn't think he would be called he has ""no knowledge of this incident at all."" ""Of course, I will,"" Christie told CNN. ""I've been more open about this than anybody in public life. I've been investigated by three public entities, two of them led by partisan Democrats who have all found that I had no knowledge of this incident and no involvement."" it's unclear what the developments from Monday's court date, and prosecutors saying that Christie was aware of Bridgecate, means for the possibility that the governor will testify. Even if Christie doesn't take the witness stand, the governor will likely remain front and center in the federal trial. Last month, a former Christie staffer, who worked underneath Kelly, claimed that he "" flat out lied "" about his staff's involvement in Bridgegate during a December 2013 news conference. What's at stake for the defendants? If a jury finds Baroni and Kelly guilty, they each could face prison time for their involvement in Bridgegate. Fishman, the federal prosecutor in the case, told The New York Times at the time of the indictment that Baroni and Kelly each face a maximum sentence of 86 years. It was more likely that Baroni and Kelly would receive up to three years behind bars if convicted, Fishman added. Of course, they could also leave the court as free people, should a jury clear them of all charges.

" Voters using Google to research candidates in competitive House races this year might not realize that the ""voter guide"" that pops up in their browser is actually funded by a House Republican political group. The new digital tactic has frustrated Democrats who claim the site gives the appearance of being non-partisan when it instead presents GOP attack lines. The campaign manager for LuAnn Bennett, a Democratic candidate in Northern Virginia who is challenging GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock, found "" voterguide2016.com "" when he was searching his boss' name. While the layout and biographical information was fairly straightforward, the language on the campaign matchup immediately resembled GOP talking points. The ""Need to Know"" section describes Bennett's record as ""making promises she doesn't keep, like promising to build a preschool and daycare center with green space and a playground for the DC community. However, she never completed it."" The ""On the Issues"" area proclaims Bennett supported ""President Obama's nuclear deal with Iran, even though it allows Iran, a state sponsor of terrorism, the ability to eventually produce its own nuclear weapons."" On Comstock the site describes the freshman lawmaker as ""an independent leader"" and lists several issues that are top items on the minds of voters in the area: ""Opioids, traffic congestion, Metro funding -- Barbara has been in the thick of today's public policy debates."" At first glance the "" voterguide2016.com "" website looks like a neutral source. It features pictures of candidates of both parties in more than two dozen districts, with maps and sections labeled ""trending"" and ""candidates."" It doesn't specify that a ""Republican"" created it. But if you scroll all the way down to the bottom you find in small print the initials for the party committee that indicate it is a biased webpage -- ""Paid for by the NRCC and not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee. www.nrcc.org The NRCC is the Capitol Hill-based National Republican Congressional Committee, the main political arm for House Republicans. Democratic campaigns in roughly eight swing House races realized that the GOP strategy involved not only creating the site, but also buying geo-targeted Google search terms to drive people to it. When voters in these districts type in candidate names the search engine lists this Republican generated page at the top of the results. It's not against any rules, but Democrats who reviewed the sections and what is designed to look like analysis on the site told CNN the tactic was ""misleading and underhanded."" Robert Howard, spokesman for Bennett's campaign, criticized Comstock's party for the strategy, telling CNN, ""Without a record to stand on and an agenda more in line with Trump than her constituents, it's no shock she and her allies would resort to deceiving voters with a fake website."" But according to advertising strategists this approach is a natural extension of how the parties already use contrasting messages. Outside advocacy groups regularly prepare voter guides to give to voters to specify which candidates back their causes. ""Over 40% of all digital advertising is search. It would be silly to ignore this, whether you are selling soap or political candidates,"" one leading digital ad strategist, who is not affiliated with either political party, told CNN. The NRCC's ""independent expenditure"" or ""IE"" arm is responsible for the site not the committee itself, according to one senior Republican source. This separate group uses millions to run ads and support GOP candidates but cannot coordinate with the NRCC or individual campaigns. No one from the IE would talk to CNN about what they are spending on the site or why they chose to use the model it on a voter guide. Independent expenditure groups are established by both party committees and frequently produce some of the more negative political ads during the campaign season. They give the candidates and the party some cover because while they can't talk directly about their content, they can mimic messaging to help reinforce how races are framed. Katie Martin, spokeswoman for the NRCC views the new website as part of the broader effort to reach voters, telling CNN Republicans are ""constantly working to find new, creative, and innovative ways to target voters online."" Many House candidates on both sides already establish websites to attack their opponents. But when they buy the domain name election laws require that they disclose the campaign is behind the effort. For example, the Bennett campaign bought "" stoptrumpcomstock.com "" which links the GOP congresswoman to Donald Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, who is unpopular in the district. Democratic campaign operatives maintain that this particular voter guide site is in a different category because it is an attacking candidates under the premise that it is presenting unbiased information without making it clear that one political party is paying. Martin, not surprisingly, disagrees, telling CNN, ""While Democrats might cry foul because they want to continue to hide from their records, the NRCC is happy to make their positions known in a smart and completely transparent way digitally."" It's unclear how much traffic the site will get, and whether it will translate into actual votes in November. Democrats will have to decide whether it's worth shifting money out of ad budgets earmarked for television commercials on local stations, which are the most expensive line item with the broadest reach, or to counter with their own digital response.",0.007763975,0.00310559,0.004658385,0.01242236,0.031055901,0.242236025,0.00621118,2,-1,1
"Posted by John Prager on 21 Sep 2016 On Wednesday, talk show legend Montel Williams posed a very simple question for conservatives: when are you going to take responsibility for their role in helping to create the violent situation in Charlotte, North Carolina? Just hours after Donald Trump proposed nationwide ?Stop and Frisk? ? a policy that was declared unconstitutional in New York. Responding to a question about ?black-on-black crime,? Trump said he would ?do stop-and-frisk? to solve the problem. ?We did it in New York,? he said. ?It worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive.? Stop-and-frisk did not, in fact, ?work incredibly well.? In 2011, for example, black and Latino residents made up about 90 percent of people stopped, and 88 percent of those were innocent. Even in predominantly white neighborhoods, blacks and Latinos were stopped more than whites. ?Donald Trump is having trouble with the facts,? New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark Viverito said in a statement regardingTrump remarks. ?Stop and frisk as it was applied in New York City was unconstitutional, itdidn reduce crime and it severely corroded the relationship between the police and the communities they serve.? Yes, ?stop-and-frisk? is a racist practice, but his suggestion that it should be implemented nationwide really resonates with some ofTrump die-hard supporters ? namely white supremacists. ?When are conservatives going to own their damn part in this?

Naturally, more ofTrump deplorablescame out to play: ButTrump acolyte apparently did not know to whom he was speaking. ?And now we know why these white supremacist bumpkins with no teeth married to their cousins love Trump,? Williams shot back: ?Big Daddy? has since slithered back into the basket and closed it, changing his name and protecting his tweets presumably because he realized that when you say racist things on the internet, people notice.It interesting how ?brave?Trump paper tigers are until someone puts them in their place.

Trump's latest additions put a sitting Republican senator who isn't supporting Trump and three non-white judges onto Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees, bringing the list to 21 names from the previous 10. The list, which Trump is set to release later Friday, includes: Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, US Court of Appeals Judge Margaret Ryan, Iowa Supreme Court Justice Edward Mansfield, George Supreme Court Justice Keith Blackwell, Florida Supreme Court Justice Charles Candy, US Court of Appeals Chief Judge Timothy Tymkovich, US District Court Judge Amul Thapar, US District Court Judge Federico Moreno and Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Robert Young. A Trump campaign aide confirmed the list, which was first reported Friday morning by NBC News.

"A billionaire who built up a corporate empire from hisfather inheritance now is running his first major political campaign with a promise to shake up the establishment and restore prosperity after a long period of stagnation. But in this caseit not Donald Trump.It Jim Justice, the Democratic candidate for governor in West Virginia and a coal baron to boot. Like Trump, Justice has been accused of not paying his bills and being out mainly for himself. And like Trump, Justice is running a nontraditional campaign that exists well outside the partisan pattern, eschewing Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in favor of a cult of personality based around his exploits in business. As WestVirginia only billionaire, he can self-fund, pumping $2.2 million into his campaign through mid-June. Justice faces stiff crosswinds, however, running as a down-ballot Democrat in one ofTrump strongest states. Story Continued Below West Virginia polling is scarce and often inaccurate, but a MetroNews West Virginia poll released earlier this month showed Trump with a49 advantage over Hillary Clinton, who won only 36 percent to Bernie Sanders? 51 percent in thestate May 10 primary. In an era of declining split-ticket voting, Justice must outperform Clinton by double digits to win.That led to a dynamic in which WestVirginia GOP candidate for governor, state Senate President Bill Cole, is embracing Trump while Justice is distancing himself from Clinton.It very nearly the opposite ofwhat happening in other states with close races. ?Across the nation, Democrats are trying to nationalize their races because they think they can use Trump as a weapon. In this race,it pretty clear Democrats are trying to localize, because Trump is not a drag but an asset for Cole,? says Kyle Kondik, managing editor of LarrySabato Crystal Ball at the University ofVirginia Center for Politics. ?This is one of the few places in the country where Republicans are more concerned with nationalizing a race than Democrats are.? In this race, Trumpisn a drag on Republicans;he an asset. The reason is simple: coal. Republicans have dominated Appalachia the past three cycles by bludgeoning Democrats with ?war on coal? rhetoric blaming Obama for the industry's decline.It hard to make that charge stick against a coal baron. And Justice definitely qualifies: He inherited an array of coal interests from his father, then enlarged them to become one of the biggest private coal mine owners in the East. That growth included the 2009 sale of his Bluestone Coal Corp. toRussia OAO Mechel for $568 million. Then the coal slump hit, and last year Justice bought Bluestone back for $5 million, less than 1 percent of his selling price. Cole, the Republican candidate, has more elective experience than Justice, buthe no establishment insider. Owner of Bill Cole Automall and other businesses, Cole is finishing only his first term in the West Virginia Senate, having previously served a few months in the House of Delegates when he was appointed to fill a vacant seat. However, Cole spent much of 2016 wrapped up in a state budget crisis and has focused his general election campaign on tried-and-true conservative policy proposals such as cutting spending and taxes, banning late-term abortions and opening charter schools. In a year in which voters largely have embraced personality over policy, that may not be enough, even in a Republican-tilting state with a wildly popular candidate at the top of the ticket. ?If you think about the primary races here, we saw a giant Trump win and a giant Sanders win,? says Scott Crichlow, associate professor of political science at West Virginia University. ?If you look at Trump, look at Sanders, look at Justice, they certainly have policies that areknown wall, universal health care, the coalindustry so much ofwhat driving the appeal for them is personality and image, not just a list of policy prescriptions.? Justice is running as a conservative Democrat, not unlike former governor and current U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, with whom he shares a number of campaign staff.He flip-flopped between the two major parties, giving money to both and changing his registration, most recently in February 2015, when he became a Democrat. However, he says hewon vote for Clinton and dismissedCole claim that he supports Obama as ?complete dog snot.? And while Justice spokesman Grant Herring says his candidate ?isn?t focused on the national political circus,? the language he uses to describe his appeal sounds awfully familiar. ?Jim is no politician,? says Herring. ?He is the outsider in this race who has the skills and experience to transform the state.? At the moment, it looks like that approach is working: A MetroNews West Virginia poll released September 3 showed Justice running away with the race at 46 percent, Cole with 32 percent, Mountain Party candidate Charlotte Pritt with 8 percent, and Libertarian David Moran with 5 percent. Many doubt the veracity of the MetroNews poll, which has varied wildly when measured against election results in recent years, but most, including Cole spokesman Kent Gates, agree that Justice is winning. ?Do I think Justice has a lead? Yes,? says Gates. ?Do I thinkit double digits? No.? Some of that is becauseJustice industry ties largely make him resistant to theGOP otherwise effective ?war on coal? messaging, which has proven to be Democrat kryptonite around Appalachia, even in districts beyond the coalfields. ?Ifyou going to win in West Virginia, you better be running against Hillary Clinton,? says Dave MudcatSaunders, a western Virginia political consultant known for his so-called Bubba Strategy, designed to help Democrats appeal to white working-class voters. Saunders, who has saidhe voting for Trump, says votersdon trust Clinton or care about her support for funding going to help coalfield economies transition to something else. ?She saidshe going to put coal out of business. West Virginia coal minersdon want a handout. They want their dignity. They want their jobs.? Ifyou going to win in West Virginia, you better be running against Hillary Clinton,? says one Democratic strategist. But Saundersdoesn have kind words for Justice either: ?He?s screwed every coal operator in West Virginia at one time or another.? Cole sees that reputation as his big opening. His spokesman, Gates, says the Republican campaign will open up attacks onJustice business record over the next several weeks. ?Jim Justice is a coal operator, buthe not a coal operator acting in the best interest of West Virginia,? Gates says. ?His legacy of unpaid bills is documented across the land.? That record extends from unpaid federal fines to unpaid vendors to unpaid state and local taxes in multiple states. In a 2014 series on delinquent mines, NPR reported that Justice ?stands out? among mining operators, owing nearly $2 million in unpaid fines at the time. That same year, a federal agency issued 39 cessation orders against three Justice companies for reclamation violations at Tennessee mines, including hiring a contractor who planted trees upside down. The problems have persisted. This year in Kentucky,Justice mines missed reclamation deadlines and owed nearly $2 million in delinquent property taxes.That an improvement from last year, when he owed $3.5 million in unpaid Kentucky taxes. In southwest Virginia, Tazewell County officials seized machinery, tools and other equipment from a Justice-owned mine this spring to make up for $850,000 in unpaid property taxes. When 2015 West Virginia property taxes became delinquent in April, Justice owed more than $3.9 million. The pattern apparently extends toJustice other businesses, as well: Two companies sued the Greenbrier for unpaid work on its golf courses for the PGA tournament, eventually settling out of court.Justice mining record, which includes extensive use of mountaintop removal mining, as well as his issues with mine reclamation, has made him the target of many an Appalachian environmental activist. The Cole campaign going negative on Justice might not push those green voters to vote Republican, but it might tip them toward Pritt, who is running for governor as the candidate of the Mountain Party, the West Virginia affiliate of the Green Party. Pritt served eight years in the state Legislature and is making her third run for governor. The last time she ran, in 1996, she defeated Manchin in a primary on the way to a loss in the general election. Both Cole and Justice have promised to bring back coal jobs, but whoever wins in November faces the monumental task of a state economythat suffered mightily with the collapse of the coal industry. According to the U.S. Census, WestVirginia 2014 median household income was $41,576, compared with $53,657 nationally. Its poverty rate was 18.3 percent, versus 14.8 nationally. Mining jobs have plummeted, falling 19 percent in the past calendar year, 26 percent from a decade ago, and 39 percent from 2011, when the market for metallurgical, or steel-making, coal spiked on the strength of a then-strong Asian economy. Mines sit idle as a string of industry giants? Alpha Natural Resources, Arch Coal, Patriot Coal, Peabody Energy and WalterEnergy for bankruptcy due to a convergence of factors including a slumping Asian economy, competition from cheap natural gas, and federal clean-air regulations that resulted in a wave of older power plants closing or converting to natural gas. While the market for metallurgical, or steel-making coal may eventually return,it unlikely the same will be true for steam, or power-producing, coal. The coalindustry struggleshaven just hurt WestVirginia employment rate, but also its state budget. The reduction in coal and natural gas severance tax collection contributed to its budget crisis, along with an economy that generally has failed to transition from its fossil fuel roots. In this gubernatorial campaign, neither candidate seems eager to push that process forward. Justice, however, has experience operating in economic sectors such as farming and tourism that may be part of the recipe for recovery. He previously owned Wintergreen Resort in Virginia before selling it last year, and in 2009 he bought the famed Greenbrier Resort out of bankruptcy. Since then,he brought an annual PGA tournament and the New Orleans Saints? training camp to the Greenbrier. In late June, a month and a half after Justice won the Democratic nomination and two weeks before the Greenbrier Classic PGA tournament was scheduled to start, tragedy inadvertently threw a spotlight on the Greenbrier and the communities around it when West Virginia was slammed by historic rains and flooding that qualified as a 1,000-year event in parts of the state. Twenty-three people were killed, including 15 in Greenbrier County, and hundreds of homes were destroyed. Justice canceled the PGA event and closed the Greenbrier Resort, though it opened its doors, free of charge, to house about 200 people who had been displaced from their homes. He shut down his campaign for roughly 10 days following the flooding, appearing only at a brief press conference to announce theGreenbrier reopening date. Should he win in November, however, his response to the flooding and actions at the Greenbrier will be remembered as a defining moment. Whether Justice will win, however, remains an open question, double-digit poll lead notwithstanding.Sabato Crystal Ball recently moved the West Virginiagovernor race from ?Leans Republican? to ?Toss-up.? ?We?re being cautious because of the fact that Justice will need to run so far ahead of Clinton,? Kondik says. Trump will easily win West Virginia, but the winner of thegovernor race will be determined by how willing voters are to split their tickets, and whether Democrats remain loyal to their party or break for Pritt.That whyCole campaign is attacking Justice on his record as a coal businessman, even as they decry the federal ?war on coal.? Whether those voters go to Cole or to Pritt ultimatelydoesn matter, so long asthey not voting for Justice. In his attacks on Justice, Cole spokesman Gates repeated one line a couple of times: ?At the end of the day, Jim Justice is going to dowhat best for Jim Justice.? That line has been used about Donald Trump, too. The question for West Virginia voters on Election Day will be whetherwhat in Justice andTrump best interests is in theirs, too.

"Saying ?you guys? is one of many microaggressionsthese days. Using the incorrect pronoun to refer to someone else is also considered a microaggression, and in severe cases can carry with it criminal penalties. Now, mispronouncing astudent name ? even ifit particularly difficult ? is considered a microaggression.I talking about people from other countries who speak other languages and come from different cultures who have names that are difficult for us English-speaking people to pronounce.We all had encounters with people from Central America, or India, or China, or somewhere in Eastern Europe, and have to have them repeat their name slowly so that we can ? to the best of our abilities ? pronounce it correctly. But unless you speak their native language fluently,you not going to get it. Itdoesn matter how close it sounds to you, inside,they laughing at the way you say their name. And I think most of these people understand that their names might be difficult for others ? such as in America ? to pronounce. But now, teachers mispronouncing their students? names ? even ifthey difficult ? is a ?microaggression.? Andthere a national movement to make sure teachers across the countryaren guilty of this microaggression. CNS News reported: According to ?My Name, My Identity: A Declaration of Self,? a national campaign launched in 2015 by the Santa Clara County, Calif. Office of Education (SCCOE) and the National Association for Bilingual Education, a teacher who mispronounces astudent name can cause that student ?anxiety and resentment?. ?Mispronouncing astudent name truly negates his or her identity, which, in turn, can hinder academic progress,? according to Yee Wan,SCCOE director of multilingual education services. Rita Kohli, assistant professor of education at the University of California at Riverside, says it is a sign of microagressionwhen a teacher mispronounces, disregards, or changes achild name, because ?they are in a sense disregarding the family and culture of the student as well.? The Washoe County School District in Reno, Nevada is one of 528 school districts across the country that have recently implemented a campaign to ?pronounce students? names correctly? ? including names teachers and administrators find difficult or unfamiliar ? in order to be sensitive to the ancestral and historical significance of achild name. CNS News linked to a 2014 blog post by a former teacher Jennifer Gonzalez who argued that ?mutilatingsomeone name is a tiny act of bigotry.? She continued: ?Whether you intend to or not, whatyou communicating is this: Your name is different. Foreign. Weird.It not worth my time to get it right?. ?And before you get all defensive about the bigotry thing,let be clear: Discovering that something you do might be construed as bigotrydoesn mean anyone is calling you a bigot.It just an opportunity to grow.? Whatwasn brought up, of course, is how people from outside the U.S. pronounce Americans? names. My name is easy for me to pronounce, but non-Americans often have a hard time pronouncing it. And guess how much it hurts my feelings when they mispronounceit? Not a bit.

"On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen criticized a Barack Hussein Obama appointed federaljudge order reinstating DACA as offensive for even suggesting that ending the said program is racist. In addition, she went as far as to rightly declare DACA unconstitutional and unapologetically affirmed that her oath of office is to follow the U.S. Constitution. Nielsen appeared on the show Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace discussing various issues facing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, but of course, a large majority of the interview concerned the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). DACA is an amnesty program for 800,000 illegal aliens announced by then President Barack Obama and developed by former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. DACA, which is a predecessor of an even wider program named DAPA was based on the same legal argument but instead covered over four million illegal aliens. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that DAPA was illegal and once President Trump was inaugurated, the federal government, under his order and that of Attorney General Sessions, dropped the remaining legal appeals and let the larger program lapse. Via Breitbart: DACA Amnesty Chain Migration Would Exceed Four Years of U.S. Births NEW YORK CITY, New York ? The Democrats? draft Dream Act amnesty would likely add as many chain-migration foreigners to the United States population as are added by the total number of Americans who are born in four years? time. As House and Senate Republicans, Democrats, the big business lobby, the cheap labor industry, and the open borders lobby have teamed up to push an amnesty for potentially millions of illegal aliens who are enrolled and eligible for the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, the impact the move would have on Americans would be likely unprecedented. Under the current legal immigration system, immigrants who are given a pathway to U.S. citizenship are eventually allowed to bring extended family members, children, their parents, siblings, and extended family members to the country. This process, which makes up more than 70 percent of the current legal immigration, iswhat known as ?chain migration.? Research by the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) reveals that under a DACA amnesty deal, between about 800,000 and 3.5 million illegal aliens could be eligible for legalization to permanently remain in the U.S. Of those, MPI notes that 1.5 million of the estimated 3.5 million would be allowed to obtain U.S. citizenship. According to Princeton University researchers Stacie Carr and Marta Tienda, newly naturalized Mexican immigrants in the U.S. bring an average of six foreign relatives with them. Therefore, should all 1.5 million amnestied illegal aliens bring six relatives each to the U.S., that would constitute a total chain migration of nine million new foreign nationals entering the U.S. Chain Migration of Potentially 19M Foreign Nationals Would Follow Amnesty for Illegal Aliens -? Amnesty for illegal aliens would lead to unprecedented chain migration of upwards of 10 million foreign nationals, under current law. If the number of amnestied illegal aliens who gained a pathway to citizenship under an amnesty plan were to rise to the full 3.3 million, and if each brought in three to six foreign family members, the chain migration flow could range from 9.9 million to 19.8 million foreign nationals coming to the U.S. This chain migration flow triggered by a DACA amnesty ? where an end to chain migration is not coupled with the plan ? would be more than double the number of babies born in the U.S. every single year, which stands at about four million a year. Should a DACA amnesty trigger a chain migration flow of 19 million foreign nationals, it would be more than quadruple the number of American births every year. The chain migration of a DACA amnesty would potentially outpace the populations of American cities like New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston. Such a chain migration would boom the number of foreign-born residents in the U.S. to a historic high. Currently, the foreign-born population is already at historic levels, reaching 44 million this year with no end in sight as legal immigration reductions to give relief toAmerica working and middle-classes are stalled in Congress. Trump has previously stated that an amnesty deal for DACA illegal aliens would have to include an end on chain migration in order to stop surges of legal immigration to the U.S., though it remains unclear how many Republicans would be willing to break from their big business donors to help pass a law to end chain migration. Most recently, a group of Senators released legislation known as the SECURE Act that would end chain migration ? thus reducing legal immigration to 500,000 admissions a year to give relief to Americans ? but couples the pro-American immigration reform with an amnesty for DACA illegal aliens. Nearly 120,000 foreign nationals have been allowed to enter the U.S. since 2005, despite coming from countries designated as state-sponsors of terrorism, including Iran, Syria and Sudan, Breitbart News reported. Chain Migration Imported 120K Foreign Nationals from Terrorist-Funding Countries Since 2005 -? Nearly 120,000 foreign nationals have been allowed to enter the US since 2005 despite coming from state-sponsors of terrorism. In total, about 9.3 million foreign nationals have entered the U.S. since 2005 because of chain migration, making it the largest driver of legal immigration to the country. As Breitbart News reported, chain migration makes up more than 70 percent of all legal immigration ? with every two new immigrants bringing seven foreign relatives with them. What we all need to keep in mind is the fact that almost a million illegals who would be covered under DACA would account for another 23 new immigrants each, because of the idiotic laws concerning chain migration. That would mean that DACA would add another 19 million people to the US. That would most certainly mean another 18 million Democrat voters in the future. Many of which are located in the Republican stronghold of Texas. If the GOP ever does lose the state of Texas there will never be another Republican President again. And if you believe Texasisn in play? Let me remind you that California went to Nixon, even in 1960, and then to Reagan twice and George H.W. Bush in 1988.

"Story highlights A New Jersey Port Authority official said Chris Christie was aware of traffic problems in 2013 His testimony is part of a case in progress against two of Christie's former aides (CNN) New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was informed about the traffic problems at the George Washington Bridge in 2013 as they were happening, according to the testimony Tuesday from a former Port Authority executive. While at Ground Zero during a 9/11 memorial event on September 11, 2013, Bill Baroni, the former Port Authority deputy executive director, and David Wildstein, the Port Authority director of interstate capital projects, had a discussion with Christie about the traffic issues, Wildstein testified Tuesday in federal court. The testimony is part of the trial for Christie's former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, and Baroni, who have both pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges in connection to the lane closures that caused the traffic problems, an incident that has come to be known by some as ""Bridgegate."" Christie has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing or involvement with the lane closures, and he has never been charged with any crime related to the handling of the incident.

" For as far as Chris Christie has fallen politically over the last three years, there has always been one saving grace: No evidence existed to directly tie him to the incident that sank his presidential ambitions. Until, at least according to US prosecutors, now. It was an unexpected moment during the Monday opening statement by Vikhas Khanna, an assistant US attorney prosecuting two former Christie administration officials now charged with fraud -- the assertion that Christie was aware of the alleged political retribution being carried out by aides. It was one that directly contradicted years of Christie's statements to the contrary, including one as recently as Sunday. ""I have been investigated by three different entities, two of them led by partisan Democrats, who have all found that I had no knowledge of this incident and no involvement in it,"" the New Jersey governor told Jake Tapper on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Christie has never been charged and never listed as a co-conspirator by prosecutors. But the revelation put forth by prosecutors underscored once again, for all to see, the scope of the political scandal that played the leading role in destroying his presidential ambitions. And his vice presidential ambitions. And, quite possibly, any cabinet ambitions in a Donald Trump administration. In September 2013, Christie allies shut down lanes of the George Washington Bridge in an alleged effort to exact political retribution on the Democratic mayor of the town of Fort Lee, who had refused to endorse Christie's re-election. Christie's former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, and former Port Authority deputy executive director Bill Baroni have pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges in connection to the lane closures Christie's blanket rejection of any involvement -- and any knowledge -- of what occurred in September 2013 has been consistent and unyielding. Through investigations, both internal and by New Jersey Democrats, and a battering from local officials and the press, the New Jersey governor remained steadfast. ""How many more investigations do you want?"" a frustrated Christie would ask reporters at one point. Yet, as if to underscore how comfortable he was in his innocence, Christie still decided to launch his presidential bid. It was an effort that sought to recapture the moment -- and momentum -- Christie was party to shortly after his blowout re-election victory in November 2013. But Christie was clearly wounded. He went from leading the party's initial polls to firmly stuck in the middle tier of the pack. And that was before Donald Trump proceeded to run roughshod over the field. For a period, Christie appeared to be getting back on track. His favorability numbers, which tanked in the wake of the bridge scandal, started to turn right-side up in the crucial state of New Hampshire at the end of 2015, aided by a major advertising blitz by the super PAC supporting his candidacy. But it was short-lived. Even as the issue rarely came up during the dozens of town hall he held, Christie couldn't recapture his campaign magic. ""I have both won elections that I was supposed to lose and I have lost elections that I was supposed to win,"" Christie told supporters after his sixth place finish in New Hampshire. ""And what that means is you never know, and it's both the magic and mystery of politics that you never quite know when which is going to happen even when you think you do."" But Christie and his aides, in candid moments, couldn't help but talk about what may have happened were it not for the George Washington Bridge -- an exercise repeated in July, as Trump went through the process of selecting his running mate. Christie himself, in an interview on MSNBC, acknowledged that the ""Bridgegate"" scandal contributed to Trump's decision not to select him as his running mate. ""I'm sure it was a factor,"" Christie said. It was a position, aides said, that by the end of the selection process Christie was openly lobbying for -- and one he acknowledged afterward he was disappointed not to receive. ""I'm a competitive person,"" Christie said in a CNN interview in July. ""When it was clear that Donald wanted me to compete for this job and to be considered, I wanted to win, of course you do."" For now, Trump advisers say, Christie is firmly encamped inside Trump's inner circle. A confidante and sounding board, Christie has a three-pronged role in Trump's operation: surrogate, adviser and the head of Trump's presidential transition team. Trump, in a statement to The New York Times, made no mention of the court case or Christie's potential plight -- instead making clear he had no plans of abandoning the man who provided his first top-tier endorsement in the primary, saying Christie has ""been a spectacular advocate ever since."" He's also gained repeated plaudits for his transition efforts -- a secretive operation that nonetheless has been lauded by lobbyists, donors and GOP officials who have received briefings on its work. ""It's the most in-shape thing the Trump guys have going right now,"" one lobbyist who attended one of the briefings told CNN. But many of those looped in on the transition operations have long thought one of the recipients of a top job in a Trump administration would be ... Christie. Asked on MSNBC if he wanted a role in a Trump administration last week, Christie responded simply: ""It depends on what I'm offered."" But the question now becomes what can Christie, long considered in the running to be attorney general, can be offered. As one GOP official supporting Trump pointed out: ""Trump respects his loyalty -- and that's why he's fine now. But I have a sneaking suspicion Senate Democrats, who he'd need to get confirmed don't care much about that.""",0.023774146,0.005943536,0.007429420999999999,0.008915305,0.052005944000000005,0.249628529,0.0,2,-1,1

"Story highlights Clinton and Trump are both watching debate videos of one another Trump has huddled with his advisers, including RNC chairman Reince Priebus Washington (CNN) Donald Trump is watching videos of Hillary Clinton's past debate performances -- including both her highlights and lowlights -- ahead of their first debate Monday.

He diligently thumbed through the pages of a farewell defense, which he had been working on moments before he addressed the Clinton Global Initiative one final time. ?It?s been one of the great honors of my life,? Clinton said as he addressed crowd. ?You are living proof that good people committed to creative cooperation have almost unlimited positive impact to help people today and give our kids better tomorrows. Now, I have spent the last 15 years of my life working to advance that idea.? WHAT TO KNOW President Clinton slowly walked toward the podium, newly repositioned at the center of the stage under the spotlight. He diligently thumbed through the pages of a farewell defense, which he had been working on moments before he addressed the Clinton Global Initiative one final time. The former president stood in front of his longtime friends, many them world dignitaries and leaders of NGOs, and also in front of his Clinton Foundation staff. He meticulously laid out a detailed history of his foundation. According to Clinton Foundation staff, the formerpresident nostalgic play-by-play in some part served as his defense to repeated criticism plaguing the Clinton Foundation during the presidential election cycle. Emails released by the State Department show that some Clinton Foundation donors received meetings with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, which prompted Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to accuse the Clinton Foundation of being a ?pay for play? organization. But Bill Clinton today shied away from engaging in the politics surrounding his foundation and instead used his platform as an attempt to change the negative narrative that has been seen as a liability to hiswife presidential bid. Clinton proudly recalled trips around the world, partnering with governments, corporations and influential people to deliver HIV/AIDS medication, fight childhood obesity and provide homes for Haitian families following the devastating 2010 earthquake, among countless other initiatives. The CGI Annual Meeting runs at the same time at the United Nations General Assembly, hoping to attract world leaders who can only attend if they pledge to commit to a cause. ?Everybody who comes has to actually make a commitment to do something to make the world a better place. Wewon saythere a minimum dollar amount, wewon saythere a minimum time amount, but they got to do something,? explained the former president. And then he joked, ?And I thoughtwe about to have a meeting and nobody will come.? Attendance at the annual meeting has dragged a bit since Hillary Clinton announced her presidential bid, as some donors have tried to keep space between the Clinton Foundation and her run for president. In previous years, President Barack Obama has attended and presidential candidates on both sides have come, but not this year. But Bill Clinton did not allow the scrutiny to keep him from giving CGI members a charge to continue their work, even if it would be without him. ?Don't give up on what brought you here. You have done something good and noble and worthy andit all just beginning,? said the former president. ?If we embrace our common humanity over our interesting differences and get up tomorrow in knowing that just if we get caught trying and we do it with somebody else, chances are it will work out better than it ever dreamed. CGI worked out better than I ever dreamed.?Today meeting was the twelfth and final CGI convocation, and Bill Clinton announced last month that he would resign from the board of the Clinton Foundation if Hillary Clinton wins the presidential election.",0.01459854,0.00729927,0.01703163,0.00973236,0.024330900000000003,0.255474453,0.0,2,-1,1
" Hillary Clinton just called out the fact that Donald Trump cheered for the housing crisis in anticipation of its collapse ? which is absolutely true. Trump told The Globe and Mail in March of 2007: ?People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, andI excited if it is.I always made more money in bad markets than in good markets.? In fact, Trump thought the housing crisis was much-ado-do about nothing for high-end investments, and told investors: ?Idon see the subprime problems affecting the higher-endstuff fact, he is advising investors that there are now great deals in buying subprime mortgages at a discount and repossessed houses at low prices.? Of course, on one level, Trumpwasn wrong???in that the subprime crisis affected mostly poorer Americans who lost their homes and jobs and the ability to support their families. The collapse of home prices caused by the housing bubble cost roughly seven million Americans more than $7 trillion in equity during the Great Recession.

"The State Department initially proposed processing 250 pages every two weeks, or about 750 pages by the election. | Getty Judge sets modest pace for release of FBI-found Clinton emails State Department ordered to process 1,050 pages of recovered messages by early November. The State Department has found about 5,600 work-related emails relevant to Hillary Clinton in a set turned over by the FBI at the end of its investigation into her private server setup, but it appears only about 10 percent of those will be processed for release to the public in advance of the November election. The pace of release ordered by a federal judge Friday is far slower than the State Department managed last year when it was disclosing as much as 7,000 pages per month from the roughly 54,000 pages of email records Clinton provided to her former agency at the end of 2014. Story Continued Below After a hearing in U.S. District Court, Judge James Boasberg issued an order requiring State to process 1,050 pages of the FBI-discovered email records by the election. They are to emerge publicly in three batches, on Oct. 7 and 21 and Nov. 4. After that, State will continue to produce the emails . At the hearing, Boasberg initially said he would order the processing of 1,050 documents in the case by early November, but he later revised his direction to require only that many pages. State initially proposed processing 250 pages every two weeks, or about 750 pages by the election. The conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch urged the judge to put all 5,600 emails out before the election. ""What we are looking for is as much quick turnaround as possible,"" Judicial Watch attorney Lauren Burke said. However, the judge suggested it was ""unrealistic"" to expect all 5,600 messages to be processed in the next six weeks. The judge acknowledged a public interest in getting the records out before voters go to the polls Nov. 8, but he repeatedly expressed sympathy for the challenges State has faced in responding to dozens of Freedom of Information Act lawsuits relating to the emails of Clinton and her top aides. He also said he was reluctant to disrupt processing of records in those other cases. ?I think we all need to bear in mind the State Department has other duties beyond FOIA requests,? said Boasberg, who was appointed by President Barack Obama. ?I know the State Department has been working very hard. ... The courtcan jump to the head of the queue.? After the hearing, Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said he disagreed with thejudge ruling. However, Fitton saved his real firepower for the State Department, saying the agency is overseeing ?an absolutely corrupt process.? ?The State Department is being obstructionist. They have had these records since July andthey only released five records,? Fitton said, referring to a smattering of messages released in other cases seeking information on specific topics. ?It?s an obvious slow-walking.? A State Department spokeswoman declined to comment, but referred to a statement in which spokesman John Kirby said State ?voluntarily agreed? to turn the messages over to Judicial Watch even though they were not inState possession at the time of thegroup request. He said the records will be posted onState website whenthey been processed. Justice Department lawyers atFriday hearing provided more insight into what the FBI turned over to State. Attorney Lisa Olson said the main disk of recovered Clinton emails contained 15,171 documents, of which more than 60 percent, or over 9,400, were ?deemed purely personal? during a recent ?appraisal.? That left about 5,600 considered work-related at least in part, she said, althoughKirby statement said some of those may also be deemed entirely personal after further review. Just how much new information will emerge by the election or thereafter remains unclear, for a variety of reasons. Many of the 5,600 emails are likely to be duplicates or what State calls ?near-duplicates? of the ones Clinton already turned over. (State says a ?near-duplicate? is an already-processed message with a nonsubstantive notation, like a request to print it out.) Olson said atFriday hearing that the duplicates appear to be a significantand substantialnumber of the overall set. Another Justice lawyer, Marcia Berman, said she believed a sampling of the 5,600 found ?almost half? were duplicates or nearly so. In addition, State could decide to withhold some of the messages in their entirety, in which case they would still count as processed pages even though the publicwouldn see them. Classified emails are being treated separately. Olson said a set of those records FBI turned over to State appears to be almost entirely duplicative of material State already processed. State could exceed thejudge order but seems unlikely to proceed much faster given the litany of statements the agency has made about being under-staffed and overburdened by FOIA requests and lawsuits relating to emails exchanged by Clinton and her close aides. There also the possibility another judge handling a related case could order faster production, but the chance of that also seems remote. DuringFriday hearing, Berman said the State Department no longer has the level of staffing in the FOIA section that it did when the agency was cranking out thousands of pages a month from the main set of Clinton emails. ?Many of those folks have returned to their regular duties,? Berman said. ?There?s been a lot of attrition.It a very difficult and demanding job these days ... and not a lot of fun.?",0.077531646,0.003164557,0.001582278,0.02056962,0.113924051,0.27056962,0.0,2,-1,1

"The American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity has been running radio ads focused squarely on Tuesday's oral argument about the EPA's Power Plan. | Getty Coal industry mounts unusual court-focused ad campaign Radio ads urge a favorable decision from judges hearing high-stakes case Tuesday over Obama administration's greenhouse gas policy. As the coal industry and the Obama administration brace for a potentially momentous legal showdown over climate-change policy at a federal appeals court this week, the industry is mounting part of its argument in an unusual venue: on the radio. For the past few weeks, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity has been running radio ads focused squarely on Tuesday's oral arguments before a 10-judge, en banc sitting of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Story Continued Below ""On September 27th the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has an important decision to make onEPA Power Plan.It a decision that affects everyAmerican ability to have affordable energy and jeopardizes everystate ability to make their own energy policies and it will be a clear violation of the 10th Amendment to the Constitution,"" a serious-sounding announcer declares as ominous music plays in the background. ""It is our duty to uphold the Constitution and say no toEPA Power Plan."" A video posted online by the same pro-coal group uses similar language, suggesting a need to take action on Tuesday. ?On September 27, it is our duty to uphold the Constitution and the people it is designed to protect,"" the video says. The ads and the video never explain precisely who's being called on to do ""our duty,"" but the EPA plan to limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants is not going before Congress this week nor is there some referendum. The only people who get to vote Tuesday (or soon thereafter) are 10 of the 11 active judges on the D.C. Circuit. (Chief Judge Merrick Garland has bowed out of hearing cases while his Supreme Court nomination is pending.) Legal ethics rules prohibit lawyers involved in a case from engaging in out-of-court communications with judges under most circumstances. Judges are usually prohibited from initiating or permitting out-of-court contact about a case and are supposed to put such communications on the record when they do occur. The theory behind the rules is that cases should be decided based on written briefs and arguments presented in the courtroom. The American Coalition for Clean Coal Energy is one of the parties challenging the Environmental Protection Agency power-plant rules in the series of cases set to be heard Tuesday during an extraordinary court session planned to stretch for more than three-and-a-half hours, not counting a lunch break. A spokeswoman for the group, Laura Sheehan, said she was not available for an interview Friday. She did not respond to emailed queries about the cost and scope of the ad campaign or the target audience. ?The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals? decision is critically important as it will either put a halt toEPA out-of-control regulatory decision making or give it the green light to continue to run roughshod over states? constitutional rights,? Sheehan said in a statement posted on the group's website. Prominent legal ethics experts said there's little doubt the ads are aimed at influencing the D.C. Circuit judges. ""They're obviously aimed at intimidating the court into doing what is politically popular, letting the judges know there will be repercussions if they don't decide it the right way,"" said Richard Painter,a law professor at the University of Minnesota and a White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush. ""They're not running these ads aimed at people affected by the administration's position on coal. They're aimed at the judges and their families and friends trying to put the heat on them....This is one more step in the direction of politicizing the courts."" Painter said the ads would be improper if lawyers for the parties before the court were involved. ""I don't think lawyers litigating the case would have anything to do with this. That would be highly unprofessional,"" he said. The ads and online video quote renowned Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe saying alarmingly that endorsing the administration's crackdown on greenhouse gas emissions would be like ""burning the Constitution."" The comments come from congressional testimony Tribe offered last year. The group's video actually shows fire appearing to consume the nation's founding document Tribe did not respond to emails asking if he was involved in producing the ads or approved of them. He's set to argue at Tuesday's court session on behalf of coal mining firm Peabody Energy and several others members of the coal-industry coalition running the ads. Some ethics lawyers said the ads are protected by the First Amendment, but may not be a good idea. ""The trade group is engaging in free speech. But it risks annoying the judges,"" said Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University. ""Assuming that risk is unwise because the judges won't be influenced. I bet the industry's lawyers are themselves chagrined by the campaign. The judges are expected to ignore what they may hear just as they are expected to ignore, [such as] an editorial, and decide based only on the record."" Advertising advocating for a specific outcome in a pending court case is highly unusual, but not unprecedented. When the Supreme Court was considering the constitutionality of bans on gay marriage last year, a group of Christian pastors and activists took out a full-page Washington Post ad days before the decision, urging the court not to require states to recognize gay marriage. The court did so anyway, by 5-4 vote. In-person protests related to Supreme Court cases are common, but the court has managed to use its rules to push them off its grounds and onto the adjoining sidewalks. Last year, the D.C. Circuit upheld those rules. The Supreme Court has also upheld a state law that courthouse banned demonstrations near courthouses, even when aimed at judges rather than jurors. The lengths to which the coal industry is willing to go to try to influence the outcome of this week's arguments may reflect the unusually pivotal role the D.C. Circuit could play in thecase that may wind up being more critical than the Supreme Court. That's because it seems possible, if not likely, that the shorthanded high court could split 4-4 in the case. If that happens, the D.C. Circuit ruling would stand. On February 9, the Supreme Court voted, 5-4, to halt implementation of the EPA power-plant rules until the D.C. Circuit resolves the case and the justices have a chance to decide whether to take up a virtually-certain petition to review that decision. Four days later, Justice Antonin Scalia was found dead in his room during a trip to a Texas ranch. The earlier vote on the stay application suggests it wouldn't be granted if the issue arose today andsuggests it is far from certain? that the court could divide along ideological lines on the underlying case.",0.033128833999999996,0.001226994,0.002453988,0.02208589,0.05398773,0.295705521,0.001226994,2,-1,1
"Story highlights Obama has moved to normalize relations with Cuba He was the first sitting US president to visit in 50 years Washington (CNN) President Barack Obama on Tuesday tapped the highest-ranking US diplomat in Cuba as the first ambassador to the island in more than 50 years. But deep opposition among some senators means it's nearly impossible he'll be confirmed before the President leaves office. Jeffrey DeLaurentis has served as the United States' charge d'affairs in Havana since 2014, overseeing the reopening of the US Embassy there and helping shepherd in a new era of US-Cuba ties.

""There is no public servant better suited to improve our ability to engage the Cuban people and advance US interests in Cuba than Jeff,"" Obama wrote. DeLaurentis was long expected to be named to the ambassador post, but critics of Obama's Cuba policy have remained steadfast in their opposition to any nomination. Cuban-American Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have been among the most vocal critics, saying the Castro regime is still violating basic human rights.

"Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump's debate performance and his past statements on the housing market. | AP Photo Biden calls Trump 'painfully uninformed' after rocky debate An exasperated Vice President Joe Biden told the crowd at a Hillary Clinton campaign rally in Philadelphia that ?Donald Trump is painfully uninformed? on the issues important to the presidency and expressed disbelief at the GOPnominee rhetoric on the economy. ?DonaldTrump is painfully uninformed. No, no, thisisn for cheering. I want to make an important point,? Biden said, quieting the crowd atPhiladelphia Drexel University. ?And his policies are not very helpful for the country, but what bothers me about this race, and I knowI sort of a one-man broken record on this, but what bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.? Story Continued Below Biden alternated between speaking quietly, jokingly asking rally attendees ifthey seen Mondaynight presidential debate, and raising his voice almost to the level of outrage as he railed againstTrump past statements on the economy. The vice president slammed the Manhattan billionaire for bragging, as he did Monday night, about not paying federal income taxes, suggesting that such a message did not resonate with hard-working, middle-class Americans. The vicepresident harshest criticism of Trump concerned the real estatemogul past statement that the 2007 crash inAmerica housing market was good for his business. Of such comments, Biden rhetorically asked the crowd ?what in hell is he talking about?? ?Look,I been there for eight presidents, Democrat and Republican,I disagreed and agreed. But every president I have served with, including the Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American,? the vice president said. ?Can you imagine Ronald Reagan, the most conservative presidentwe had in a long time, can you imagine him saying, ?it?s good business to take advantage ofpeople misery,? rooting for that misery? I really mean this. I am not joking. I am not kidding. What does it say about this man?? Biden acknowledgedClinton struggles to gain traction with young voters, who polls show are dissatisfied with both major party candidates and have thus gravitated to third-party options like Libertarian Gary Johnson and the GreenParty Jill Stein. But Hillary Clinton is in lock step with the majority of young people, Biden said, on issues like marriage equality, abortion rights, and reducing the cost of college education. The vice president also told the crowd thathe spent a significant amount of time throughout this election cycle answering questions from foreign leaders nervous that Trump might win the White House. He saidhe had to reassure leaders from the Baltic states concerned that the GOP nominee might back out ofAmerica NATO commitments and Australian leaders worried thatChina influence in the Western Pacific might grow under Trump. ?Look last night, you got a good look at both the candidates, you saw them both. Hillary demonstratedshe a leader, she has courage, she cares about the circumstances of the American people, not just the super wealthy,?

"Schumer with Clinton at a campaign rally. | AP Photo/Seth Wenig New Siena poll finds Clinton, Schumer with big leads in New York ALBANY ? While Donald Trump and his supporters have recently expressed optimism the Republican presidential nominee can carry New York in November, he still has a lot of ground to make up for that to happen. A poll conducted by the Siena College Research Institute last week found Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leading Trump 51 percent to 30 percent in New York with third-party candidates included, a modest change from the 50 percent to 25 lead she enjoyed in August. Story Continued Below While the two most recent Siena pollsaren perfectly comparable ? lastmonth looked at registered voters, while the one released Tuesday deals with likely voters ? there were some demographic groups among which Trump showed improvement. In particular, voters in New YorkCity suburbs seem to have warmed to him. Clinton led there, 42 percent to 31 percent in August; the gap has since narrowed to 39 percent to 38 percent. Trump also appears to be doing slightly better among young voters (those between 18 and 34 years old backed Clinton 51 percent to 18 in August; now they back her 53 percent to 27 percent) and Jewish voters (Clinton?s lead slid from 51 percent to 25 percent in August to 45 percent to 31 percent this month). ButTrump support plummeted among low-income earners. In August, people earning less than $50,000 a year backed Clinton 46 percent to 29; her lead among that group now stands at 64 percent to 23 percent, the poll found. Additionally,Clinton lead among African Americans increased from 79 percent to 5 percent last month to 85 percent to 1 percent in the latest poll. Trump is now running fourth among thestate black electorate, with his 1percent falling short of Libertarian GaryJohnson 4 percent and the GreenParty JillStein 3 percent. The new poll also found that U.S. Sen. CharlesSchumer lead over Republican challenger Wendy Long has grown from 63 percent to 24 percent in August to 69 percent to 23 percent this month. If undecided voters break the same way as those who have already made up their minds, Schumer is on pace to received 75 percent of the vote in November, passing the modern record of 72.2 percent Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand received when she defeated Long in 2012. In other findings, Gov. AndrewCuomo favorability stands at 57 percent, up slightly from the 53 percent favorability rating he enjoyed in August. But voters said they ?prefer someone else? to Cuomo in the 2018 gubernatorial race by a margin of 49 percent to 45 percent, up slightly from 47 percent to 46 percent last month.

" Debate stages have long doubled as presidential burial grounds. With a few sharp lines, an acid quip, or just a well-timed nod, the candidates can do more to unravel their opponents than in a hundred speeches or television commercials. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have made no secret of their disdain for each another. But on Monday night, there will be no safety net and nowhere to hide -- just two people on stage and, as some analysts believe, 100 million more watching their every move. Here are some of the most devastating lines in presidential debate history -- will Trump or Clinton need to be added to this list? Reagan rolls Carter The incumbent President Jimmy Carter wanted to talk about Ronald Reagan's work as governor of California. But Reagan had heard enough -- and bet that voters felt the same way. As Carter finished a long point with a comment on his opponent's ""typical"" positions, Reagan stepped in with four words: ""There you go again."" Obama mocks Mitt Mitt Romney had been hammering President Barack Obama for having downsized parts of the armed forces. But Obama turned it around on his 2012 challenger, mocking and painting him as out of touch with modern foreign policy questions. On the question of the smaller number of Naval ships, Obama said: ""Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines."" A killer joke In 1984, Reagan sent Republicans into a panic with a garbled opening debate performance against Walter Mondale. The Baltimore Sun's Henry Trewhitt asked if the President's age would keep him from being able to do the job. Here is Reagan's cheeky response, which Mondale would later describe as having effectively ended the race: ""Not at all. And, Mr. Trewhitt, I want you to know also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience."" Lloyd Bentsen knew Jack Kennedy, then he owned Dan Quayle You can see it about 15 seconds into the clip. Vice presidential candidate Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's brow shoots up as Dan Quayle, George H.W. Bush's 1988 running mate, answers a question about his relative inexperience, saying, ""I have as much experience in the Congress as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the presidency."" Bentsen fired back: ""Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy."" Mondale buries the ""hatchet man"" Before he was a warmly remembered war hero who lost his own presidential race in a 1996 landslide to Bill Clinton, Bob Dole had a different kind of notoriety. During a 1976 vice presidential debate with Walter Mondale, he showed why. Asked if Watergate, and then President Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon, were off-limits, Dole launched into a long rant essentially blaming ""Democrat wars"" for killing millions of Americans. Mondale hit back with one line: ""I think Sen. Dole has richly earned his reputation as a hatchet man tonight."" Perot sets himself apart With his Texas twang, Ross Perot made a serious dent in the 1992 presidential race. Here he underlines why his lack of experience in government was going to be a political asset: ""I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. I don't have any experience in gridlock government, where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent crime-ridden society in the industrialized world. But I do have a lot of experience in getting things done."" Lincoln prints and publishes his debate zingers Abraham Lincoln and Steven A. Douglas square off in a cartoon titled, ""The undecided political prize fight"" (1860) Though the words were spoken during one of their celebrated 1858 Senate debates, Abraham Lincoln was so pleased with his performance against Stephen A. Douglas, he took the transcripts (which he edited, liberally, on his own) and published them in a book before their 1860 presidential rematch. In arguing that Douglas was using a flimsy principle as a bogus pretext for spreading slavery nationwide, Lincoln mockingly asked what remained of the substance of his rival's position: ""Has it not got down as thin as the homeopathic soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had starved to death?"" Gore questions (the first) Bush's resume Al Gore was running for vice president in 1992, but that didn't mean he wasn't aiming high. Here is the shot he took at George H.W. Bush, who had sought to attach his record to that of his former boss Reagan, during a three-way debate with Dan Quayle and Adm. James Stockdale: ""George Bush taking credit for the Berlin Wall coming down is like the rooster taking credit for the sunrise."" Bush shakes off Gore Sometimes, words are unnecessary. At 11:58 in this clip, early on in his debate with Al Gore, George W. Bush responds to the vice president's ill-timed stroll and apparent attempt to intimidate him with a simple -- but devastating -- silent shake of his head.",0.006097561,0.006097561,0.006097561,0.006097561,0.030487805,0.21189024399999998,0.004573171,2,-1,1

" Every Presidential nominee since 1976 has released their tax returns except for Republicans Donald Trump and Gerald Ford. Debate moderator Lester Holt put Trump on the spot about releasing his returns, and he filibustered, hemmed and hawed intensely, used the old ?I?m waiting for an audit to finish? excuse, and then actually dropped a shocking revelation ? sayinghe been under audit for 15 years now! ? before unleashing a horde of ?4 Pinocchio? level lies. The IRS has confirmed time and time again that there is nothing preventing Trump from releasing his returns, and noting that it is very unusual to be under audit for so long, implying thatthere something foul at play. But thishasn been just a dodgy situation in this campaign; Trump promised to release his returns if President Obama released his birth certificate. We all know how that turned out: In 2011, when Trump was spearheading the movement questioning whether President Obama was born in the United States, Trump told ABC News that he would release his tax returns if Obama released his long-form birth certificate. ?I?d love to give my tax returns,? he said. But once Obama released his birth certificate, Trump hedged. ?At the appropriate timeI going to do it,? he said. The appropriate time never came. It turns out that Trump has been under audit for 15 years! It also turns out that the repeated questions aboutTrump missing tax returns did yield one revelation from the Republican nominee ? he tacitly admitted hedoesn pay income tax, and he thinksthat great because it makes him smartand not greedy. In the end, Hillary Clinton scored her very best zinger of the night after Trump looked like a one armed wall-paper hanger with crabs, trying to cover up a very large wall, with nothing more than shameful lies and promises, and certainly none of his tax papers which the American people deserve to see before voting for thiscountry President.

"CRAZY Liberal Flips Off ?Big Redneck? Trump Supporter ? Then Calls the Cops to Save Herself (VIDEO) Liberals are not known for their rationality and logic.

One liberal learned the hard way that the rest of the worlddoesn always play along. Some crazy liberal girl was driving along to pick up her son from school when she was confronted with the worst thing she could possibly come across: a homeowner with Trump signs on his lawn. She said that she drives past his house occasionally and it makes her absolutely enraged, having to see a private citizen expressing his own First Amendment rights.

"A Treasury Department spokesman acknowledged on Saturday that on at least two occasions, the U.S. did make payments to the Iranian government via wire transfer. U.S. wire payments to Iran undercut Obama The United States made at least two separate payments to the Iranian government via wire transfer within the last 14 months, a Treasury Department spokesman confirmed Saturday, contradicting explanations from President Barack Obama that such payments were impossible. Responding to questions at an Aug. 4 press conference about a $400 million payment delivered in cash to the Iranian government, Obama said, ?[T]he reason that we had to give them cash is precisely because we are so strict in maintaining sanctions and we do not have a banking relationship with Iran that we couldn't send them a check and we could not wire the money.? Story Continued Below But a Treasury Department spokesman acknowledged on Saturday that on at least two occasions, the U.S. did make payments to the Iranian government via wire transfer. In July 2015, the same month in which the U.S., Iran and other countries announced a landmark nuclear agreement, the U.S. government paid the Islamic republic approximately $848,000. That payment settled a claim over architectural drawings and fossils that are now housed in the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art andIran Ministry of Environment, respectively. Then, in April 2016, the U.S. wired Iran approximately $9 million to remove 32 metric tons of its heavy water, which is used to produce plutonium and can aid in the making of nuclear weapons. While some sanctions relating toIran nuclear program were lifted with the implementation of the nuclear agreement, others imposed over the IslamicRepublic human rights policies and support for terrorist organizations remain in effect. The July 2015 wire transfer was made while the full weight of sanctions against Iran were intact, while the April 2016 payment for heavy water was made after the lifting of nuclear-related sanctions. The Treasury Department spokesman explained that the lifting of those sanctions allowed Iran ?to gain incremental access to the international financial system, which opened up more options for executing transactions, such as the heavy water transaction? that occurred in April 2016. The spokesman declined to offer an explanation as to why the July 2015 payment was possible despite the full array of sanctions in place at the time. That $400 million cash payment that Obama said could not have been delivered any other way was part of a larger $1.7 billion settlement with Iran, the remainder of which was also delivered in cash. The $400 million, paid in January to settle a decades-old dispute over military equipment order by the late shah of Iran, was sent through intermediary central banks in Europe, who then delivered pallets of euros, Swiss francs and other currencies to Tehran. The Treasury Department spokesman said that the January settlement specified that payment be made in cash because Iran had previously had difficulty accessing wire-transferred funds and was ?very aware of the difficulties it would face in accessing and using the funds from the January 2016 settlement payment if they were in any other form than cash.? A senior Obama administration official contested that the TreasuryDepartment confirmation of the twin wire transfers contradicted what the president said at his press conference early last month. The official repeated what the president said at the time, that ?we do not have a direct banking relationship with Iran, which means that we cannot wire money directly to Iran,? but did not directly address either the July 2015 or April 2016 wire transfers. ?Sanctions had effectively cut off Iran from the international financial system and after several years of trying to gain limited access to its own money held in accounts outside of Iran, Iran was very aware of the difficulties it would face in accessing and using these funds if they were in any form other than cash,? the official said of negotiations surrounding the $1.7 billion settlement. ?Therefore, effectuating the payment in foreign currency banknotes was the most reliable way to ensure that they would receive the funds in a timely manner.? Republicans in Congress and on the campaign trail have alleged that Iran requested a cash payment specifically because it would make the money difficult to trace. GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump made an issue of the cash payment over the summer, suggesting that the cash delivery likely wound up funding terrorism or found its way into ""some of the mullahs' bank accounts."" Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), who discovered the two wire transfer payments in briefings with Obama administration officials, echoed those concerns in an interview with POLITICO on Thursday. ?Oh, Idon have any question that Iran wants the money in cash because they wanted it faster than what a wire transfer would be andit fungible,? Lankford said. ?They announced pretty quickly afterward that they were expanding their defense and their military budget by $1.7 billion dollars, an exact amount that we had just sent over to them. So Idon think that was accidental.? ?But when you give cash, wecan track,? he continued. ?Did that go to Hezbollah? Did that go to the Russians? Did that go to the coup in Yemen?There no way to be able to track that.? Republicans, including Lankford, have also suggested that the $1.7 billion delivery constituted a ransompayment because it was delivered on the same day that U.S. prisoners were released by Iran. The president dismissed such claims during his Aug. 4 press conference as ?the manufacturing of outrage? and said unequivocally, ""wedon pay ransom for hostages.? But State Department spokesman John Kirby acknowledged two weeks later that the U.S. had refused to deliver the cash to Iran until its prisoners were wheels up from Tehran, a decision Kirby said the U.S. made to ?retain maximum leverage? over the Iranians. Despite that admission, he maintained that the arrangement did not in any way constitute a ransom payment.",0.027696792999999997,0.0,0.0014577260000000001,0.017492711,0.051020407999999996,0.22448979600000002,0.011661808000000001,2,-1,1

" North Korea went on the offensive Friday, blasting the US for ""aggression"" in Asia, blaming Washington for its pursuit of nuclear weapons and threatening the US with ""tremendous consequences beyond imagination."" The Democratic People's Republic of Korea ""had no other choice but to go nuclear,"" Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly, to defend itself ""from the constant nuclear threats from the United States."" Ri's comments came as the US and Asian nations gathered in New York Friday with a fresh reminder of what they consider the gravest threat facing the region: North Korea's announcement this week that it had successfully tested its most powerful rocket engine yet. The test Tuesday was followed by a US show of force, as the Pentagon on Wednesday flew two B-1B bombers alongside the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea, setting the the stage for US-South Korea joint military exercises in October that will include a simulated nuclear facility strike. The heightened tensions, North Korea's steady drumbeat of tests and its nuclear ambitions have put the region on edge and the Pentagon on notice. ""North Korea's unpredictable behavior and capability development also continues to threaten allies and potentially the homeland,"" Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday in Maryland. ""It's consumed an awful lot of time -- I think it's fair to say -- of senior leadership's time over the past few weeks."" The North Korean minister offered a through-the-looking glass version of the same events. ""Only a couple of days ago, the United States has again threatened the DPRK by flying the strategic bombers 'B-1B' over the military demarcation line on the Korean peninsula and landing in South Korea,"" Ri said. ""We will never remain onlookers at it and the United States will have to face tremendous consequences beyond imagination."" Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry met Friday on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly with foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-member bloc dedicated to economic, political and security cooperation. ""The United States will do whatever is necessary to defend our own citizens and to honor our security commitments to our allies,"" Kerry told the ASEAN meeting. He called on allies to ""vigorously"" enforce sanctions against the isolated regime and urged ASEAN members to ""ensure that the DPRK pays a price for its dangerous actions."" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a blunt call for international action at the UN Wednesday. ""Right before our eyes, North Korea is carrying out a plan about which there can be no doubt,"" Abe said. ""There is no alternative but to say that the threat has now reached a dimension altogether different from what has transpired until now."" The perceived threat is changing regional dynamics, bringing old rivals Japan and South Korea closer together. It's putting China on the spot as Washington pushes Beijing to do more to rein its ally in, even as tensions over the South China Sea complicate cooperation. And it will likely prompt a new international push for tougher sanctions, the likes of which were used to force Iran to the negotiating table. That's still unlikely to stop North Korea, formally known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, experts said. Indeed, US officials and scientific experts expect another nuclear test as soon as early October. ""From North Korea's perspective, it only makes sense to continue these tests and continue to develop these weapons until there's a substantial shift in dialogue with the US,"" said Alison Evans, a country risk senior analyst at the global consulting firm IHS. ""For North Korea, it's the recognition that's the important thing. It needs its status as a nuclear power to be recognized,"" Evans said, adding that, ""The leadership sees developing a nuclear deterrent as a guarantor of survival."" US officials say the Pentagon is watching carefully for another nuclear test. Meanwhile, the Union of Concerned Scientists said there is some speculation that Pyongyang may try another satellite launch around October 10, the anniversary of the founding of its Worker's Party of Korea. North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test in January. In the ensuing months, it has followed that detonation with a total of 21 ballistic missile tests, including land- and submarine-based launches. In May, North Korea's 32-year-old leader Kim Jong-un made the country's ambitions official, announcing that Pyongyang was on a dual track of developing nuclear weapons and the economy. JUST WATCHED US B-1 bombers fly over South Korea Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH US B-1 bombers fly over South Korea 02:52 Pyongyang then staged its largest nuclear test yet on September 9, the anniversary of the DPRK's founding in 1948. And Tuesday's rocket launch was ""substantially larger and more powerful than anything North Korea has tested before,"" according to 38 North, a program devoted to analyzing North Korea at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies. All this testing is unlikely to win it the US recognition it craves, though. After the more recent nuclear test, President Barack Obama made clear that ""the United States does not, and never will, accept North Korea as a nuclear state."" Obama said that the US would work with Asian allies, the UN Security Council and international partners to implement existing measures and ""take additional significant steps, including new sanctions to demonstrate to North Korea that there are consequences to its unlawful and dangerous actions."" However, the rhetoric from the presidential campaign trail is a constant reminder that Obama administration will soon no longer calling the American shots on the issue. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has held out the possibility of meeting with Kim in a dramatic break with US political conventions. He earned criticism for the remark, as well as for suggesting that South Korea and Japan should consider developing their own nuclear weapons. ""At some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea,"" Trump told Anderson Cooper at a CNN town hall in Milwaukee in March. ""We're better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself."" The statements have rattled Tokyo and Seoul, and while Trump has said that China must play a stronger role in checking their neighbor and ally, his promise to play tough with Beijing on trade could also roil that effort. The Republican candidate's tough talk has only heightened the uncertainty surrounding American policy in the region and is likely to be something that US officials are asked to address in their consultations Friday.

On North Korea, specifically, she has emphasized ratcheting up US sanctions. International sanctions levied in March after the January nuclear test were the first on North Korea to do more than target weapons development or luxury goods for the elite. They ban all weapons trade and require inspections of all cargo to and from the country, among other steps. The international community could squeeze North Korea further by targeting the export of its resources, said Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, echoing the way UN sanctions targeted Iran by banning the export of its oil.

"NASCAR is under fire like never before, quite like this nation. Earlier this week we reported that NASCAR was getting sued $500 million after being accused of having unfair advantages for race car drivers. Specifically white race car drivers. Terrance Cox III, who is the CEO of Diversity Motorsports, filed the racial discrimination claim due to minorities being denied basically any chance in the sport of NASCAR. NASCAR quickly came out with a statement explaining why all of that was wrong.Here what Cox stated: ?In 2016, motorsports remain the most racially segregated sport in the United States. [NASCAR has] been complicit in, and supportive of, the racially discriminatory environment that virtually excludes African Americans from meaningful participation in motorsports racing in the United States.? NASCAR however completely disagrees seeing that they have programs designed specifically to end racial discrimination in the sport. ?Diversity both on and off the track continues to be a top priority for NASCAR and its stakeholders. We stand behind our actions, and will not let a publicity-seeking legal action deter us from our mission.? Whether we believe it or not, racial discrimination is still present here in America. NASCAR may not be guilty of it, but America as a whole is. Recently police in Charlotte, NC shot a black man and killed him. Keith Lamont Scott was approached by police when they were searching for a man under warrant. Scott was not the man they were looking for, but police stated that he appeared to be holding a gun. According to onlookers and family, Scott was reportedly holding a book that he was reading beforehand, and it looked like that was enough to lead policemen to believe it was a weapon. Because of this act, people of Charlotte were completely outraged. They began protesting on that day and have not stopped protesting since. Just last night, protesters went wild and violent. One person was shot while multiple shops and buildings were looted. One of those buildings was the NASCAR Hall of Fame in Charlotte.

"There?s one state where DonaldTrump ground game appears to be a model of efficiency, rather than a ramshackle operation lacking organizers and field offices: Israel. As part of an effort to target what the Israeli chapter of Republicans Overseas says are as many as 300,000 U.S. citizens living there ? many of them registered in places ranging from safe Democratic states like New York, New Jersey and California to swing states like Florida and Pennsylvania ? the pro-Trump group is employing all the traditional tools long eschewed by the campaign itself. Story Continued Below In some ways, the Trump organizing efforts are more extensive in the West Bank than in West Palm Beach, Fla. While the Trump campaign and its allies spent much of the summer waving off the importance of brick-and-mortar offices in the U.S., the Israeli team is expanding its physical footprint. So far, there are five offices open in areas around Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, as well as in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. And the group has plans to open three more offices starting as soon as this week: In Gush Etzion, which is also in the West Bank, near Jerusalem; and two others around Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.There even coalition-specificengagement top adviser to the Chief Rabbi of Israel is focused on courting the ultra-Orthodox vote for Trump, according to the campaign manager for the Israel effort. Compare that to the Trump campaign in Florida, for example, where there is little evidence of tailored Jewish outreach at all, much less constituency-focused outreach to various Jewish subgroups. Marc Zell, who heads up Republicans Overseas Israel, said they are ?closely coordinated? with both the RNC and the Trump campaign on messaging. But the Israeli-based Trump effort is supported by local fundraising, not the GOPnominee campaign or the RNC. A Marco Rubio backer in the GOP primary, Zell tried to resign his GOP leadership position after Trump won, he said, initially distraught overTrump nomination. But Zell has since come to support the Republican nominee, heartened by the strong pro-Israel language included in the platform passed atTrump convention. Many Israelis who whole-heartedly embrace Trump appreciate his tough talk on terrorism and the fact that he represents a clear break with the Obama administration, which has had a tumultuous relationship with conservative Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. One poll of Israelis from June, however, found that 42 percent of Israeli citizens overall would vote for Hillary Clinton if they were American citizens, and 35 percent would back Trump. Other organizations estimate that there are only around 200,000 U.S. citizens in Israel. But whatever the number, the pro-Trump forces are targeting a group that includes many Orthodox Jews, who tend to be more conservative ? and more likely to vote for Trump. ?People,they back from work,they going to get help through the registration process from our specialists,? said Tzvika Brot, a former Israeli journalist who is campaign manager of the Israel effort. ?Every evening,we come to that office or some base in the houses of our volunteers. We even appoint area captains for each area in Israel.? To American political operatives who have worked with the Jewish community stateside, the intensive Israeli efforts to target U.S. citizens onTrump behalf underscore how little the Republican is doing to court Jewish voters in key American swing states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and especially Florida. ?Instead of focusing on expats who are Floridians who live in Ashdod [in Israel], I would focus on Jewish Americans who live in Boca Raton,? said Michael Fragin, a consultant who worked on Jewish outreach for the Republican National Committee in Florida in 2004, and remains plugged in to the Jewish political world. In the U.S., he continued, ?Nobody I know is aware of anything going on specific to Jewish outreach.? Added Lisa Spies, who ran Jewish outreach for Mitt Romney and remains heavily involved on the pro-Israel donor landscape: ?With Trump, yes, there are pro-Israel Republicans listed on invites, or that go to events, but what they stillhaven done, and every campaign before has done, and Hillary is doing, is have a concerted Jewish outreach.? While the Jewish vote in the U.S. is traditionally heavily Democratic, there have been major efforts in recent years to convert more Jewish voters to the GOP. In 2012, Romney surrogates like former Sen. Norm Coleman hit the synagogue circuit for Romney and billboards reading ?Obama?Oy vey!? littered South Florida roads. Romney personally visited Israel. And four years earlier, former Sen. Joe Lieberman was a top surrogate for John McCain. For several election cycles, Florida Republicans have targeted Orthodox Jews, Israeli-American Jews and Jews from South America, some of whom tend to be more conservative than their generally liberal co-religionists. And Jewish Republicans could claim some success in 2012: President Barack Obama won 69 percent of the Jewish vote in 2012 ? down from 78 percent in 2008. But Trump, who has had to spend time swatting down accusations of racism and anti-Semitism following support from bigoted backers like former Ku Klux Klan head David Duke, already has built-in challenges with the community. And his lack of campaign infrastructure and outreachdoesn help either, some Jewish political operatives say.It a missed opportunity, they add, especially in Florida, a battleground state crucial toTrump path to victory, where five percent of the electorate is Jewish and presidential elections are routinely close. ?Who are their surrogates doing rallies, getting out the vote, speaking to this specific group?? Spies asked. ?Theredoesn seem to be an actual effort.? Aaron Keyak, the co-founder of the firm Bluelight Strategies and a former top executive at the National Jewish Democratic Council who worked to counter Republican Jewish outreach in 2012, said he was surprised at the barebones effort in the U.S. this year. ?Incompetencewas never a word that came up when it came to [Republican] Jewish voter outreach in 2012,? he said. ?Youdon even know where to start now.? This time around, Coleman refuses to back Trump, Lieberman is supporting Hillary Clinton ? and doing pro-Israel events with moderates and Republicans on her behalf ? and Jewish supporters and detractors of Trump both agree there has been virtually no Jewish-focused outreach from his campaign in Florida, something the campaign itself acknowledges. ?We welcome and include everybody, so I would say our approach is more general,? said Susie Wiles, who this month took overTrump Florida campaign, an operation that until recently had almost no field offices at all. ?Our approach is also more aggressive, our outreach, our voter contact is unprecedented, that includes everybody in Florida.? Shedidn deny the absence of a specific Jewish voter outreach plan in Florida. ?I would saythat not wrong,? she said. But the lack of concerted Jewish outreach effort from the campaign itselfdoesn bother some ofTrump Jewish supporters in Florida, who think the campaign is wise to focus on more sizable, less liberal-leaning constituencies. ?Those of us who are Republican Jews are plenty outspoken about the sell-out of Israel by liberal Jews, butthere no part of us that thinkswe going to change their minds,? said Sid Dinerstein, a former chair of the Palm Beach County GOP. ?There are bigger fish to fry.? The Clinton campaigndoesn see it that way. They have both a director of Jewish outreach and a Florida-specific Jewish vote coordinator, as well as operatives in Ohio and Pennsylvania who focus on the Jewish vote. They conduct ?bubbe banking? ? using the Yiddish term for grandmotherto describe programs through which Jewish senior citizens call their grandchildren and urge them to vote for Hillary Clinton.They also encouraging rabbi-to-rabbi phone banking. There are Jewish Women for Hillary events across the swing states, and weekly calls with rabbis and community leaders. The campaign has plans for more surrogates to hit swing-state synagogues, and they are highlighting centrist validators like Lieberman, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and billionaire Seth Klarman, a major donor to Jewish causes and to Republicans.That part of an outreach effort to moderates and Republicans who care about a muscular foreign policy and strong support for Israel. Jews for Progress, a super PAC chaired by former Congressman Ron Klein ? who lives in Boca Raton, Fla. ? is also planning to advocate onClinton behalf in swing state Jewish communities, with the goal of raising a sum in the seven figures, Klein said, to fund that effort. While there are Clinton volunteers in Israel as part of activities run by Democrats Abroad, their effortsdon appear as extensive as those from Republicans Overseas Israel. Asked whether there was a similar Democratic effort, Israeli operative Nimrod Dweck replied, ?No! No.There no reason. Three hundred thousand people,that like a small town.? Dweck, who works on center-left issues in Israel and has partnered with 270 Strategies, a consulting firm whose founders played key roles onObama campaigns, continued, ?If you want to work on your effort, go to key states in the U.S. Do get-out-the-vote in the United States.?",0.025067144,0.0044762759999999995,0.0035810209999999998,0.013428826999999999,0.034019696,0.276633841,0.007162041,2,-1,1
"A Dallas police officer, seeing red after several shootings of police officers, has decidedhe had enough and he and his lawyer, are going to punish everyone they absolutely can for allegedly conspiring to create a race war. Yes, this is the same ?race war? that the entire right sees whenever people call attention to the racism that permeates our justice system. Police Sergeant Demetrick Pennie, a 17-year veteran of the Dallas police force, is suing leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement ? along with the Rev. Al Sharpton, billionaire George Soros, Louis Farrakhan, former Attorney General Eric Holder, President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and many more. The bizarre part is that he and his attorney, right-wing nut Larry Klayman, actually see an active conspiracy here: ?This is a civil action for the deprivation of Plaintiffs and other members of the class herein of their civil rights, conspiracy against the Plaintiffs and other members of the class herein civil rights and obstruction of justice to prevent the enforcement of civil rights.? The complaint also says this: ?Klayman received a call from Defendant New Black Panther Party and Black Lives Matter acting in concert with the other Defendants, all of whom are working together to ignite and continue the race war they have fomented, threatening to kill him and his family.? [emphasis mine] In discussing the July 7 murders of Dallas police officers, the lawsuit states that the shooting suspect claimed he was acting alone, and was not affiliated with Black Lives Matter or anything else. An investigation into his background allegedly revealed that he was a member of the Nation of Islam and the New Black Panther Party. Apparently,that enough to tie him and these groups directly to Hillary, Obama, Holder, and everyone else, althoughit hard to see how Klayman and Pennie actually knowthere a conspiracy here.It like they just know ? the complaint repeatedly states something along these lines: ?Defendants, acting in concert, and each and every one of them are inciting the imminent serious bodily injury and killing of police officers and other law enforcement persons?? ?Acting in concert? meansthere a knowing cooperation between two or more people to accomplish something.There no real, concrete evidence that anybody is actively working with anyone else to incite violence against police officers. Yet, they keep using that phrase. We do not think it means what they think it means. Either that, or a frightening amount of paranoia fueled this. Or both.It probably both. The complaint also accuses everyone of spreading the fiction that police officers ?are intentionally and systematically targeting and hunting blacks and other minorities to kill them for no reason other than racism or sport.? Exaggerate much, Klayman? Lords, gods and minor deities,it amazing these conclusions are in an actual complaint filed in an actual court. Other known problems, such as arresting or shooting black people not guilty of any crimes, and that minorities are arrested and prosecuted disproportionately to the general population, are fiction on the planet from whence this complaint arose, too. Klayman, however, has been looking for a reason to file a suit like this for some time. Back in July, he threatened to sue Obama, Farrakhan, Sharpton and Black Lives Matter for putting his life in danger ?as a white person.? At the time, he said things like this: ?It is no wonder some cops, fearing for their lives in this anti-white, anti-Semitic and anti-Christian environment, sometimes are prone to literally pull the trigger too quickly.?He not exactly the most credible person here. He has an axe to grind, and itdoesn make Pennie look good for retaining him for this suit (or did Klayman persuade Pennie to finally give him what he needs to make a suit stick? We may never know). The discovery phase of this lawsuit ought to be interesting.

"Respondents preferred Hillary Clinton on the issue of immigration by a 51-41 margin and on trade. | Getty New poll: Clinton's lead over Trump narrows nationwide HillaryClinton nationwide lead over Donald Trump has tightened to single digits with just three days to go before the first presidential debate between the two candidates. A new McClatchy-Marist poll released Friday puts the former secretary of state 7 percentage points ahead of the Manhattan billionaire in a head-to-head matchup among likely voters, 48 percent to 41 percent. That lead is down significantly from the 15-point advantage she held in an earlier McClatchy-Marist poll that surveyed registered voters nationwide in early August. Story Continued Below In a four-way race that also includes Libertarian Gary Johnson and the GreenParty Jill Stein, Clinton leads Trump by 6 points, 45 percent to 39 percent. Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico, polled at 10 percent and Stein polled at 4 percent. Respondents preferred Clinton on the issue of immigration by a 51-41 margin and on trade by a 52-42 spread. Asked which candidate would better address the issue of terrorism, respondents favored Clinton, 52 percent to 41 percent. Fifty-seven percent of those reached said Clinton has the experience to serve in the White House, compared to just 30 percent who said the same of Trump. Likely voters reached by the poll also gave her the edge on the question of temperament, preferring her by a 50-38 margin. While recent nationwide polls have favored Clinton of late, it is Trump who has received mostly good news in swing state polling. Surveys released in recent days have shown him ahead in North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada and Ohio, while another put him and Clinton in a statistical tie in Florida. Winning in battleground states like those are crucial for Trump, who faces a relatively narrow electoral path to the White House relative to Clinton. The McClatchy-Marist poll was conducted from Sept. 15-20, reaching 1,298 adults via landlines and cell phones. Of those 1,298 respondents, 758 were considered likely voters based on a probability turnout model.

"Pat Toomey is your classic, pro-trade Republican. The former president of the free trade-promoting Club for Growth has backed a slew of trade deals during his 12 years in Congress, and last year he even praised President BarackObama Trans-Pacific Partnership as an economic boon that would helpPennsylvania economy. Then along came Donald Trump and his America-first, trade-bashing platform. Now Toomey ? among the most vulnerable incumbent Republicans up for reelection this fall ? is urging Obama to dump the TPP. Story Continued Below Toomey has plenty of company among Republicans on the Senate ballot. TheGOP unshakable faith in free trade has been decidedly broken in the year of Trump ? with everyone from a former U.S. trade representative, Rob Portman of Ohio, to free-market devotee Marco Rubio of Florida striking a much different tone. Indeed, the upended politics of trade offer a major conundrum for establishment-minded Republicans running for reelection this year, particularly in Rust Belt states that could help determine control of the Senate next year. Perhaps more than any other issue, trade has illustrated the tightrope GOP candidates have to walk in trying to appeal to Trump-fueled voters while not abandoning theGOP core economic principles. ?I?ve always believed that you actually have to get an agreement that merits the support,? Toomey said in an interview when asked whether his TPP opposition was inconsistent with his record. Pointing to its dairy and intellectual property provisions, Toomey, who was careful never to explicitly endorse the trade deal as it was being negotiated, added: ?There are real problems with TPP.? Of the Republicans who are running in the most closely watched Senate races this cycle, just two have publicly embraced the controversial trade deal: John McCain of Arizona ? who warned that the United States? future in Asia hinges on the TPP ? and Mark Kirk of Illinois. One other Republican, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, is favorable towardTPP agriculture provisions butwon weigh in on the other parts. Back in April 2015, Rubio wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal and urged passage of TPP, which would ?further our strategic goals in Asia and increase prosperity at home.? In an interview with POLITICO this week, Rubio said he is still evaluating the trade deal but noted that he was disappointedwith results of a report from the International Trade Commission that gauged theTPP economic impact. Pressed on whether his concerns about the TPP constitute a reversal, Rubio responded, ?How can it be? Youcan endorse a deal thatisn written yet.? ?The TPP as a concept is something I support.I love to have a free trade agreement with the Asia-Pacific region. But it has to be the right deal,? Rubio said. ?Just like I support home ownership, but it has to be under the right terms.? Rep. Todd Young (R-Ind.), running for the Senate seat in Indiana, says he has ?real problems? with TPP because its intellectual property provisions could harm Eli Lilly and Co., a pharmaceutical company headquartered in Indianapolis. And Republican Sens. Roy Blunt of Missouri and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire have their own problems with the trade deal with Asia. InAyotte case,she even cited trade as one area on which she agrees with Trump. All of them voted in favor of a procedural measure last year that would allow Obama to ultimately fast-track the trade deal without any amendments. The election-year shift on trade is not limited to Republicans. Hillary Clinton famously pivoted on TPP after praising the deal as the ?gold standard? of trade agreements as secretary of state. And Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia was praising provisions of the TPP just days before he was selected asClinton running mate. As soon as he joined the ticket, Kaine came out in opposition to the Pacific Rim deal. Back in Pennsylvania, Toomey and his allies correctly point out that Katie McGinty,Toomey Democratic challenger, supported and touted the North American Free Trade Agreement as an official in the Clinton administration. But the Republican sprint away from the TPP is a remarkable policy reversal for a party that has traditionally championed itself as the party of free trade. ?On the campaign trail,it just too difficult to quantify the gains from free trade and too easy to point at a plant that closed and scapegoat trade,? Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said. He added that Trump was obviouslya factor and said in an election year, ?it always comes up like this. But it seems to be bigger this year.? McCain has warned that U.S. influence in Asia could diminish if Congressdoesn approve TPP. And another reason that explainsMcCain warmth for trade, despite its decreasing popularity:Arizona robust trade relationship with neighboring Mexico that amounts to $16 billion in goods and services exchanged per year. ?I believe in free trade, andI a student of history,? McCain said in defending his support for the deal, which Democratic challenger Ann Kirkpatrick opposes. Nowhere does the political toxicity over trade resonate more than in labor-heavy states, with unions vehemently opposing the deal and Democrats trying to stoke that sentiment to turn out those voters against Republicans. In Nevada, Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto expressed her opposition to the TPP months ago and has underscored that stance in front of union audiences such as the AFL-CIO. Meanwhile, Republican Rep. Joe Heck ? who also voted to fast-track the trade deal last year ? has declined to take an official position on the agreement, though he said he had ?some concerns? about some of the tradedeal provisions. ?I thinkit difficult when you have a trade agreement with so many disparate partners thatit hard to strike a good balance,? Heck said in an interview. He did not elaborate on his concerns. The massive tradedeal prospects this year on Capitol Hill have all but evaporated, despite an intense public relations campaign from the Obama administration that continued through last week. An undeterred Obama hosted an elaborate event promoting the 12-nation deal last week, even marshaling Ohio Gov. John Kasich ? a GOP presidential candidate vanquished by Trump earlier this year ? to the White House to help press his case. YetOhio own incumbent GOP senator,Portman has a lengthy pro-trade record and counts Kasich as one of his most powerfulboosters out in opposition to the Pacific Rim trade deal in February. Democrat Ted Strickland, who has struggled to gain traction, has hammered Portman over his past support of trade deals. But Portman, like Toomey, said his stances on trade have been consistent. ?Ithasn put me in a tough position becauseI taken the same position for years ? which is balanced trade,? he said. ?We should open up more markets but we also have to make sureit fair as imports come into our country. SoI very comfortable with that position andthat where most Ohioans are.? Few expect Capitol Hill to act on the TPP while Obama remains in office, despite pressure from its advocates to take it up in the lame duck. Details of the massive trade deal remain largely unknown to voters; an August poll from Morning Consult showed that 62 percent of registered voters said they had heard little or nothing about the agreement. That same poll found that about 35 percent of voters support the trade deal and 22 percent oppose it, but 43 percent had no opinion. Meanwhile, other Republicans running for reelection have simply declined to answer questions about their TPP position. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson has yet to take a stance on TPP and declined in an interview to say whether he even has any concerns. He rebuffed Democratic challenger RussFeingold attempts to needle him into a position, accusing Feingold of making a ?knee-jerk snap decision? on TPP. ?This is over 6,000 pages. He read a 60-page leaked version on WikiLeaks?? Johnson said of the deal, which has numerous chapters and totals more than 5,000 pages, especially because it includes extensive lists of every tariff being cut. ?I?m not feeling any pressure whatsoever.I actually doing my job and doing the hard work that I think Wisconsinites expect out of their senator.?

Hillary Clinton said when discussing the recovery from the Great Recession. ?He said back in 2006, ?Gee, I hope it does collapse because then I can go in and buy some and make some money. Well it did collapse.? Story Continued Below ?That?s called business, by the way,? Trump said, interrupting.

"Story highlights Clinton is offering voters an implicit contrast with Trump Clinton will outline a series of policy proposals for people with disabilities Chappaqua, New York (CNN) Hillary Clinton's economic speech on Wednesday in Orlando will focus on how the United States can create an economy that values people with disabilities, an attempt to contrast the former secretary of state with Republican nominee Donald Trump. Clinton, an aide said Tuesday, will propose an economy that ""welcomes people with disabilities, values their work, rewards them fairly, and treats them with respect."" Wednesday's speech is Clinton's fourth in a series of addresses where the former first lady is attempting to talk more about her values and proposals and less about Trump. Clinton has so far given ""Stronger Together"" speeches on faith, community service and children and families. While those speeches have focused more on Clinton, they have not been devoid of Trump contrast. In all three speeches, Clinton has tried to keep her talk of Trump to a minimum, but they have cast him as an ill-prepared candidate who should not be president. And Wednesday's speech will be no different. Read More",0.023076923,0.0,0.023076923,0.0,0.038461537999999997,0.238461538,0.0,2,-1,1
"Last week, Donald Trump said that Hillary Clinton started the birther movement against President Barack Obama while he ended it. | Getty Simon says If you can't remember all your lies, you're telling too many Truth be told, itisn really about Hillary anymore. Her picture comes on the screen, and you are very tempted to channel surf away from it. Story Continued Below But The Donald comes on, that orange pumpkin face fills the screen, and you stop to listen to what new outrage gushes forth from his lips. It does not matter if what he says is false. That Trump lies on a regular and dismal basis is no longer a question. It is a fact. For months and months, the national press corps has been tiptoeing around this. But now it has stopped clutching its pearls and has decided to call the truth the truth and a falsehood a falsehood. ?Trump Gives Up a Lie, But Refuses to Repent,? was the front-page headline on MichaelBarbaro tough-as-nails piece in The New York Times on Friday. The article, labeled a news analysis, was about ?birtherism,? the racist lie that sought to discredit Barack Obama by saying he could not have been born in the United States because no African-American could honestly ascend to such a job. ?It was never true, any of it,? Barbaro wrote. ?Mr.Obama citizenship was never in question. No credible evidence ever suggested otherwise. ?Yet it took Mr. Trump five years of dodging, winking and joking to surrender to reality, finally, on Friday, after a remarkable campaign of relentless deception that tried to undermine the legitimacy of thenation first black president.? ?He nurtured the conspiracy like a poisonous flower, watering and feeding it with an ardor that still baffles and embarrasses many around him.? But not everybody around Trump is embarrassed. And his staff is paid to be baffled on a full-time basis. ?We own both the momentum and enthusiasm dynamics right now,? Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said a few days ago, in the Trump version of English. ?Everybody loves a winner, so people now see these polls tightening wherewe up, tied or within the margin of error in nearly all of the swing states,? Conway said. ?People are starting to see that Trump can actually pull this off.?That right. Trump is exposed as a liar and this gives him the ?enthusiasm dynamics? to pull off a victory, because lies make the polls tighten and tight polls make everybody love a winner even if he lied to get his victory. Poisonous flowers grow in such word salads, I guess. What was Conway really saying? A translation was provided in a Washington Post story on Sunday: ?After five years of peddling lies and innuendo about the circumstances of PresidentObama birth, Trump on Friday bowed to the facts and acknowledged for the first time that Obama was born in the United States, although he refused to apologize for his efforts to delegitimize thenation first black president.? There it was in a news story by Philip Rucker and Dan Balz: A major party candidate had peddled lies for five years, had finally been forced to admit the truth, but was refusing to take any responsibility for his lies and their outcome. ?Everybody loves a winner,? Conway said. On Friday, Trump said he was going to make a ?major statement? about the whole birther mess. And he was going to make this statement from his lavish, which is to say tasteless, new hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, just blocks from the White House. The press usually goes along withTrump buffoonery, giving him virtually unlimited airtime, Internet coverage and newspaper space regardless of what he has to say. This time, however, he went a little far. He managed to squeeze a lie into the nothing he had to say. ?Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it, you know what I mean,? Trump said. ?President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period.? With that, Trump left the stage, taking no questions and making no apologies. Two days later, John Dickerson had Conway on ?Face the Nation.? Dickerson: Donald Trump advocated something for five years that was a lie. Why did he do that? Conway: Well,you going to have to ask him, but again, I think this is a sideshow now. Dickerson said our next president might have to send young Americans off ?to die in wars? and, therefore, it might be important whether the president was a truth teller or a liar. Conway reacted as if Dickerson was speaking Martian and said the press really ought to be concentrating onTrump new child care plan. (Though she did not say if Trump was telling the truth about his new child care plan.) On Saturday, President Obama addressed the annual Congressional Black Caucus Foundation dinner. ?Now,there an extra spring in my step,? he said with a broad smile. ?Idon know about you guys, but I am so relieved that the birther thing is over.? ?I mean, [ISIS], North Korea, poverty, climate change ? none of those things weighed on my mind like the validity of my birth certificate!? he said as the audience laughed. Truth and falsity are important, but so is balance. Having just quoted a Democrat,I end with the words of a Republican, Abraham Lincoln: ?No man has a good enough memory to be a successful liar.? Which may be why Trump will fail in the end: He simplywon be able to keep track of all his lies.

"Clinton suggestsTrump rhetoric could be treasonous Trump fires back, accusing Clinton of being tougher on his supporters than terrorists. Hillary Clinton on Monday leveled some of her most charged attacks against Donald Trump yet, accusing the nominee of enabling Islamic State fighters with his rhetoric and hinting he may be committing treason. With a spate of domestic attacks over the weekend refreshing terror fears, Clinton and Trump hurled insults at each other on Monday, trying to convince voters that the other candidate would be a disastrous commander in chief. Story Continued Below Clinton held an impromptu news conference in the morning in which she presented herself as a steady hand in the face of terror threats and Trump as a reckless leader who is already making the United States less safe. ?We?ve heard that from former CIA Director Michael Hayden, who made it a very clear point when he said Donald Trump is being used as a recruiting sergeant in and for the terrorists,? Clinton said. ?We know from the former head of the Counterterrorism Center, Mike Olsen, that the language that Mr. Trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries,? she added, using the constitutional definition of treason.Trump camp fired back, blaming Clinton for the rise of the Islamic State because she supported pulling back on troops in Iraq in 2011. ?HillaryClinton comments today accusing Mr. Trump of treason are not only beyond the pale,it also an attempt to distract from her horrible record on ISIS,?Trump senior communications adviser Jason Miller said. Trump himself piled on, trying to shame Clinton and tying her to President Barack Obama on the terrorism issue. ?Today, Hillary Clinton showed again that she will say anything ? and blame anyone ? to shift attention away from the weakness she showed as Secretary of State,? Trump said in a statement. ?The Obama-Clinton doctrine of not taking ISIS seriously enough has emboldened terrorists all over the world. They are hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes President so that they can continue their savagery and murder.? And during an afternoon rally in Florida, Trump accused Clinton of being tougher on his supporters than she has been on terrorists. ?Hillary talks tougher about my supporters than she does Islamic terrorists, right?? he said, to cheers. ?She called patriotic Americans who support our campaign, many of them cops and soldiers, deplorable and irredeemable, and she means it. Millions and millions of people,? Trump added, recalling remarks Clinton made earlier this month when she lumped half of his supporters into a ?basket of deplorables.? The heated language on both sides comes as each are trying to reassure rattled Americans that they are the most capable of stepping into the commander in chief role. The series of planted bombs around New York and New Jersey over the weekend as well as the mass stabbing at a Minnesota mall has freshly raised fears of the reach of the Islamic State, even though details are still emerging about the inspiration for the attacks. While Clinton tried to present herself as the clearheaded alternative toTrump reckless bombast, she also had to thread the needle when it comes to her own legacy as secretary of state andObama track record. ?This is a serious challenge,? Clinton told reporters, as she sought to reassure voters that the U.S. is on the right track in combating that challenge. ?We are well-equipped to meet it. And we can do so in keeping with smart law enforcement, good intelligence and in concert with our values.? She warned against getting ?diverted and distracted? by Trump's inflammatory words, and dismissedTrump attacks on her past efforts to combat terrorism while at the State Department. ?Well,it like so much else he says:It not grounded in fact.It meant to, you know, make some kind of demagogic point,? Clinton said. ?I am prepared to, ready to actually take on those challenges, not engage in a lot of, you know, irresponsible, reckless rhetoric, but to do the hard work asI done before, to put into place the strategies for local and state law enforcement for an intelligence surge, for the kind of preventive actions we need to take here at home and to intensify our efforts to defeat ISIS.? Clinton also suggested Americanswon hear heropponent plan, and not because it's secret. ?He keeps saying he has a secret plan. Well, the secret is he has no plan,? she said. ?Solet focus on what we really can do, and what I've laid out is a path forward that will keep us safer, protect our country and go after the terrorists to finally destroy them.? But Trump was eager to tether Clinton to Obama, and also pounced on a remark from White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who referred to the terrorism fight as a ?narrative battle? against whether the U.S. and the West is battling against the Muslim religion. ?I will bring an end to these senseless acts of violence. They are wrong to say thatwe in a fight about ?narratives.? These terrorists pose an existential threat to our country, our values, and our way of life,? Trump said.Trump running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, joined in the sniping, saying he was dumbfounded by the WhiteHouse use of the term ?narrative fight? and linking Clinton to it. ?I?m not sure that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama know thatwe at war,? Pence told conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. ?The White House spokesman today actually said that we were in a ? quote ? narrative fight, in a narrative battle. Idon even know what that is.?

"Defending Donald Trump is no easy task, but even his most prominent campaign members are struggling to make sense of his behavior and comments. WhenMSNBC Morning Joe had campaign manager Kellyanne Conway on board to talk ahead of the Monday night debate between Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton,Trump righthand womancouldn have been any more defensive and avoidant. In all honesty, she failed miserably to make her candidate look good, and choked under the pressure. Bloomberg Politics host Mark Halperin, who was also a guest on Morning Joe with Conway, asked the Trump campaign manager about Trump falsely accusing the debate moderator,NBC Lester Holt, of being a Democrat. He asked: ?He said Lester Holt was a Democrat. Lester Holt is a Republican. How could he say such a thing that just black-and white factually incorrect?? It was a fair question, and Conwaywasn ready for it. Her response was basically that Trump was not a liar; he just spoke without knowing the truth. Conway responded: ?Idon know that he knew what LesterHolt voter registration is.? Halperinwasn letting it go. He pressed Conway, repeating back to her whatshe just said: ?Without knowing then, he asserted he was a Democrat?? Conway then tried to use one of her boss? favorite interview tactics ? dancing around questions. She fired back: ?First of all, if you tell me the media are not overly populated with Democrats,that false.? At this point, Halperin is getting frustrated and tries to keep Conway focused. He points out just exactly what was wrong inTrump comments about Holt: ?I?m asking about a very specific thing. He made a factual claim about the moderator who deserves the right to be treated fairly and it was just wrong. Andit a metaphor for his frequently in public stating things with no basis, that are wrong.? Again, instead of responding, Conway began talking about the backlashNBC Matt Lauer received after being ?too nice? to Trump. It then becomes obvious that MorningJoe Mika Bzrezinki is also losing her patience, when she says, ?This is a filibuster? while Conway rants on. Halperin once again tries to bring the conversation back: ?You?re not answering what I asked you.I asking you how someone running for president can assert on the eve of the debate that the moderator is a Democrat, which is factually incorrect? How can he do that?? ?Heshouldn have asserted? hedidn say, ?Idon know what he is, but I thinkhe biased,? he saidhe a Democrat.? Conway left this topic again to attack Hillary Clinton and the media, and Brzezinski had to refocus her by saying, ?Idon understand what that has to do withMark question. We were asking why he lied about Lester Holt.? Conway finally says, ?Idon think he lied? and Brzezinski corrected her, ?Um, I think he did.? Conway then gave this moronic reply: ?Mika, a lie would mean he knew theman party registration.? Co-host Joe Scarborough had to cut the conversation short, but not before an exasperated Halperin could ask, ?So as president, would he say things that are false without knowing the truth??

"Under the Radar Blog Archives Select Date? December, 2017 November, 2017 October, 2017 September, 2017 August, 2017 July, 2017 June, 2017 May, 2017 April, 2017 March, 2017 February, 2017 January, 2017 The State Department has been swamped with lawsuits seeking emails sent or received by Hillary Clinton during her tenure as secretary of state. | Getty Judge gives State Department tongue-lashing over Clinton classification training records A federal judge lashed out at the State Department on Monday over what he charged was foot-dragging over Freedom of Information Act requests relating to Hillary Clinton's service as secretary of state. ?You have a client that, to say the least, is not impressing the judges on this court, myself included. ? It is in yourclient interest to start being more obviously cooperative,? U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon warned Justice Department lawyers representing State during a hearing Monday. ?The State Department is at risk of being perceived as obstreperous. [They] need to get with the program.? The 10-minute hearing took place on a suit for records on how ? and whether ? Clinton and her aides were trained to handle classified information. State had proposed a deadline of Oct. 17 to produce about 450 unclassified documents relating to the training issue sought by the Daily Caller News Foundation. However, Leon ordered the diplomatic agency to complete processing and disclosure of those records by Oct. 10. He also said State must produce the records in three installments ?of comparable size? andcan leave the bulk of the records to the last batch. ?We will do our best,? Justice Department attorney Jason Lee told Leon. ?Do better than your best. ? You do it,? Leon shot back. The issue of classified-information training for Clinton and her aides has drawn attention in recent weeks, after FBI Director James Comey observed that three emails received by Clinton had paragraphs marked with a (C) for information classified as ?confidential,? although the entire messages were not properly marked as classified and appeared to have involved a cut-and-paste job. Comey also said that any senior official should have realized the topics being discussed in other emails were not suitable for an unclassified system. According to an FBI report, Clinton said she could not recall receiving any training or briefing on how to handle classified information. However, when the extent of her use of a private email account as secretary was revealed last year, Clinton said: ?I?m certainly well-aware of the classification requirements.? An initial search for records responsive to the Daily Caller request turned up no records at all about training for Clinton or deputy chief of staff Huma Abedin, while some were located for chief of staff Cheryl Mills and Director of Policy Planning Jake Sullivan. However, a lawyer representing the Daily Caller, Brad Moss, asked State to do a more thorough search. That turned up over 1,000 records last week, the bulk of them classified files about the process State uses to approve access to a highly classified program and to withdraw it when it is no longer necessary or a person leaves government. In an interview broadcast Monday on NPR, former President Bill Clinton said he trusted the State Department to make sure there was no conflict of interest with the Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. Lee said many of those records are classified ?Top Secret or higher than Top Secret.? That complicates the processing because people have to be granted the proper clearances, he said. He offered no estimate when those records will be processed, although most of them are expected to be withheld as classified. Leon also made clear that he believes the case should be prioritized because of the looming presidential election. ?It?s time sensitive because it involves a national election for president,? the judge said. Moss had objected toState plan to finish production of the roughly 450 documents by Oct. 17, because that is only two days before the final presidential debate. The judge appeared to agree, saying the Daily Caller should have ?time to go through them ? for whatever newsworthy value they believe they have.? State has been swamped with dozens of lawsuits seeking emails sent or received by Clinton during her four years as secretary, as well as emails of her top aides and records on various other topics related toClinton tenure. As the election draws nigh, State has faced demands from many quarters to get particular records out prior to the election. However, Leon, a George W. Bush appointee,didn seem interested in hearing much about that Monday. Instead, he noted that no lawyer from State was present atMonday hearing. ?Impress upon them this way of doing business needs to stop,? the judge told Lee. ?They?re not feeling the heat.? The verbal fusillade prompted Lee to step forward with further explanation, but he only managed to utter the words, ?Your honor ?? before the judge stood and walked off the bench. ?We?ll issue an order,? Leon declared, passing up whatever Lee had planned to say and brusquely leaving the courtroom. State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau declined to comment on the case that was in court Monday but sent POLITICO a statement defending her agency's broader transparency efforts. ""The Department strongly believes the Freedom of Information Act is a critical part of maintaining transparency to the public. Generally speaking, there has been a significant surge in FOIA requests to the State Department in recent years and we are working diligently to respond,"" Trudeau wrote. ""The volume of FOIA requests received by the Department has increased 300% since 2008 (6,000 requests per year to over 20,000 per year). In fiscal year 2015 alone we received approximately 22,000 FOIA requests."" Trudeau also said efforts are underway to improve State's responsiveness to public records requests. ""We are taking steps to improve our FOIA process ? including conducting FOIA training sessions for staff and working to implement new technologies and best practices. Last year, Secretary Kerry appointed Ambassador Janice Jacobs as Transparency Coordinator to help address records management challenges across the Department,"" the spokeswoman said.

They used words like ?capable,? ?well-informed,? ?responsible,? and ?qualified.? They dutifully praised her positions on issues like abortion, student debt, mass incarceration, and climate change, while emphasizing the importance of stopping Trump and his inflammatory rhetoric. But most of them did not sound particularly inspired. ?Bernie was a genuine grass-roots kind of guy, and he really spoke to the younger generation,? said Nicole Brigstock, a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania who wore a ?NO WAR? pin next to her ?Ready for Hillary? pin. ?He truly cared about progressive issues. I guessI like to believe that she does as well.?Clinton campaign staff acknowledges that after losing millennials to Sanders by blowout margins in the Democratic primary,she still underperforming in that age group in the general. They described the Temple speech as an effort to earn the votes of young people who might not know where she stands on issues like equal pay for women, gay rights, the minimum wage, and college affordability. She also appealed to their sense of tolerance and multiculturalism, attacking Trump as a racist, sexist, and generally divisive figure, repeatedly pushing her campaign themes of Stronger Together and Love Trumps Hate. The conventional wisdom on millennials is thatthey swayed more by passion and emotion thansubstance in politics as well as smartphones,they always looking for the shiny new thing. But coming of age with the first black president, very few of them expressed excitement about the prospect of the first woman president. On the other hand, her young supporters here almost all name-checked her more traditional liberal views, in contrast toTrump calls to build a wall and undo most ofObama work, as well as her knowledge of policy, in even sharper contrast to Trump. In her speech, Clinton admittedshe not much of an entertainer, but touted her commitment to the ?slow, hard business of governing,? pointing out that she knows the interest rate on student loans down to the decimal point. ?She?s showing thatshe experienced,she reality-based, she cares about policies we care about,? said junior Mike McDermott, a former Sanders supporterwho on the executive board of the Temple Democrats. ?Young people want to see that kind of positive message.It not sexy, butit about getting the job done.? Margaret Strolle, a graduate student in history at Villanova, said Clinton gets a bad rap from starry-eyed Sanders types who think politics is about waving magic wands and making everything better. She said Clinton is a realist, and like Alexander Hamilton in the Broadway musical, has been in the room where it happens. ?People deride her for being part of the system but I like her experience,? Strolle said. ?She?s not making big promises about howshe going to change everything, butshe committed to getting things done, even ifit incremental.? Trump is wildly unpopular with millennials, so the real danger for Clinton is that they could vote for third-party candidates or stay home, and she warned Monday that Trump could win if the youth turnout is stagnant. Judging from the students at her event, that might be her strongest millennial message. Tom Quinn, a nursing student and a registered independent who had considered voting for Libertarian Gary Johnson, sayshe now convinced that only two candidates have a path to victory, and that Trump is unacceptable. ?Wecan have a racist president,? he said. Bernie Mann, a diehard Sanderssupporter noted they even share anameshe realized she can vote for his platform by voting for Clinton: ?It felt a lot more real from Bernie, butshe way, way, way better than Trump.? Vicki Gouvalis, a moderate Republican and voted for John Kasich in the primary, said she was undecided before Clinton spoke, then told me after the event she will vote for Clinton. ?I was shocked by how much I agreed with her,? Gouvalis said. The good news for Clinton is she has room to grow with undecided millennials who loathe Trump and share many of her views. The bad news is that many of them are undecided because theydon like her or trust her. Several Clinton supporters who showed up Monday saidthey still concerned about her emails, her support for the Iraq war, and her ties to Wall Street. They said most of their Bernie-or-Bust friends are coming around as the election nears, but not all of them. ?Everyone keeps sayingshe a liar, andI like, what politicianisn?? said Jeffrey Fuentes, a junior whose parents are Salvadoran immigrants. ?I think people will come around, butthey not amped up like they were for Bernie.? At Temple, Clinton tried to reach out to reluctant millennials, telling unusually personal stories about her mother and other women who influenced her, urging them to resist the notion that politics is all corrupt and no one ever changes. And there was one group of millennials at the event whose enthusiasm seemed to defy all the punditry: young black voters, who never felt the Bern in the first place. James Walton, a 30-year-old buyer for a Philadelphia manufacturing company, said African-Americans appreciateClinton attention to the minimum wage, police brutality, and gun control;he lost three friends to gun violence. ?We?re millennials, too,? he said. ?Andshe speaking to our demographic.? Jeanmarie Elican, a senior at the University of Pennsylvania, said that as a black woman, she appreciatesClinton concern about discrimination against minorities, immigrants and gays. But like so many of her fellow Clinton supporters, she saidshe most energized about stopping Trump, a candidate who has dismissed Black Lives Matter, retweeted white supremacists, and argued that blacks should vote for him because their lives are so abysmal they have nothing to lose. ?I have plenty to lose,? Elican said. ?Donald Trumpdoesn see black people as people. Ifthat not a reason to vote, Idon know what is.?

"Some of thenation largest for-profit college chains are suffering steep declines in enrollment amid heavier government scrutiny. | Screengrab Education Department issues death penalty to for-profit college accreditor The Obama administration on Thursday terminated the federal recognition of the nation's largest accreditor of for-profit colleges ? a rare move that could ultimately jeopardize the ability of hundreds of schools to access federal funding. The decision against the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools amounts to what is effectively a death penalty. The sanction had been sought by prominent critics of for-profit colleges like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who on Thursday called the accreditor a ""negligent"" organization that had ""rubber-stamped shady institutions"" for years. Story Continued Below The accreditor's seal of approval had allowed billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded Pell Grants and federal loans to flow to the now-defunct Corinthian Colleges chain of schools, which shut down last year amid allegations that it lured in prospective students using false, inflated job placement rates. ACICS was also the accreditor for ITT Tech, another troubled for-profit college that declared bankruptcy last week. The accreditor says that about 600,000 students across the country are enrolled at colleges that it approves. ACICS officials on Thursday pledged to appeal the decision directly to Education Secretary John B. King Jr. ? a move that would temporarily put the termination on hold.There no timeline for when King must act on that appeal, but earlier this week he pledged to get it ?resolved quickly.? Roger Williams, the interim president of ACICS, said in a statement that the group was disappointedin the decision but confidentit could show ?ongoing progress? toward coming into compliance with federal rules. If the Education Department stands by its decision, ACICS-accredited colleges would have 18 months to find a new accreditor, or else their students would lose access to federal money. Congress earlier this week passed legislation that allows GI Bill educational benefits to continue to flow to student veterans for up to 18 months after theirschool accreditor loses its federal recognition. Like other college accreditors, ACICS acts as a gatekeeper for federal money: Last year, it allowed 243 colleges to tap into $4.76 billion worth of Pell Grants and federal student loans. The Obama administration's termination decision was based upon earlier Education Department findings that ACICS failed to properly monitor and discipline the colleges it oversees. ?ACICS?s track record does not inspire confidence that it can address all of the problems effectively,? wrote Emma Vadehra, King's chief of staff, who issued the ruling. ?Many of the problems identified in the staff report are serious and long-standing.? ACICS has been a prime target of for-profit critics and some Senate Democrats in recent years. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), on Thursday praised theadministration decision in a statement, saying that ?far too many schools have maintained their institutional accreditation, even while defrauding and misleading students.? But Rep. John Kline (R-Minn.) blasted the EducationDepartment decision as ?an unprecedented action that could disrupt the education of hundreds of thousands of students, particularly low-income and minority students.? The for-profit industry's trade association argued that thedepartment decision is yet another example of the unfair targeting of their industry by the Obama administration. ""The U.S. Department of Education's decision today will have horrible ramifications for hundreds of thousands of students, thousands of dedicated faculty and staff, and hundreds of communities and employers that rely on institutions accredited by ACICS,? said Steve Gunderson, who leads the Career Education Colleges and Universities trade group. ""No Administration has politicized accreditation like the current one.? Ben Miller, senior director of Postsecondary Education at the Center for American Progress, authored a report criticizing the record of ACICS that was frequently cited by a federal panel in making its recommendation to nix the accreditor. Miller praised Thursday's decision, calling it a ""landmark step for protecting students and taxpayers."" Terry Hartle, senior vice president at the American Council on Education, said schools without any red flags can probably find a new accreditor in one year to 18 months, but it could take two years or much longer for other schools to find a new home. ?It?s a major step,? Hartle said. ?The department has done it at least once before, but never with an accreditation agency of this size.?

Add Hillary Clinton as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hillary Clinton news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest The Democratic presidential nominee today held a millennial-focused campaign event at Temple University in Philadelphia, where she made her pitch to the voting bloc that has been unwilling to fully rally behind her. ""Even if you are totally opposed to Donald Trump, you may still have some questions about me. I get that,"" Clinton, in a moment of self-reflection, told the crowd of 300 people. ""And I want to do my best to answer those questions.? She explained that the servicepart of ?public service? has always been easier for her than the publicpart. ?I will never be the showman my opponent is and, you know what, that's OK with me,? she said, referring to Donald Trump. Over the past week, the Clinton campaign has redoubled its efforts to attract millennials, whom demographers define loosely as people born in the early-1980s through the early-2000s. Clinton surrogates President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have all been tapped to hit the trail. The main focus: urging young people to vote. ?We need everyone off the sidelines,? Clinton said today. ?Not voting is not an option. That just plays intoTrump hands, it really does.? Clinton, who started her remarks calling on the country to ?remain vigilant? in the wake of the bombings in New York and New Jersey, also used the opportunity to contrast herself with her Republican opponent. ""You want something to vote for, not just against,"" she told the crowd. ?Optimism, not resentment. Answers, not anger. Ideas, not insults. Bridges, not walls. ?You're also here because you know this election isn't a reality-TV show. It shouldn't be about birth certificates or name calling or stunts to get on the cable news,? she added, referencingTrump long-held and false belief that Obama was born outside the United States. ?This election comes down to a choice between two very different visions for America,? she concluded. Trump has since said that he believes Obama was born in the United States. Although Clinton is polling better with young adults than Trump (a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found that she has 40 percent support among youth versusTrump 28 percent), the demographic, as a whole, has shown less enthusiasm for her candidacy than other Democrats. According to that same poll, 60 percent of Democratic adults under the age of 30 said they had hoped Sanders would win theirparty nomination, while 26 percent said Clinton. That number, however, is better than it was four months ago. (During the primary in spring, 75 percent of Democrats under the age of 30 supported Sanders, while only 25 percent said they supported Clinton, according to the ABC News/Washington Post poll.) Clinton campaign officials, who hope to close that gap further, say they plan to continue these outreach efforts throughout the rest of the campaign. ""The millennial generation is a key voting bloc in this election and it's clear that the campaign must do more to earn their vote,? Clinton spokesman Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement today. ?That is why the campaign has recently ramped up efforts to engage millennial voters through a stretch of events with surrogates like President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, Senator Tim Kaine, Anne Holton, Chelsea Clinton, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders. ?The campaign has also brought on board staff at headquarters and in states to organize and mobilize millennial voters,? she added. ?And over the coming weeks, the campaign will continue to host discussions in communities on how Hillary Clinton is fighting for them.?

" Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump claims to have ?a great relationship with theblacks nearly every poll shows Trump losing the constituency by 80 percent or more. One ofTrump vile advisers went so far as to say Trumpdoesn speak in front of predominately black crowds because he fears for his life, and withTrump recent disgusting comments in North Carolina about black voters, it is no surprise as to why. The failed businessman gave a rambling, fact lacking, nonsensical speech in Kenansville, North Carolina where he lamented about Democratic presidential nominee HillaryClinton lack of foreign policy experience, despite Clinton being the most qualified presidential candidate in American history. AfterTrump failed attack, he moved on show the nation why black voters do not support his candidacy : Our African American communities are in the worse shapethey ever been? Ever. Ever. Ever. This single tweet explainsTrump racism perfectly: It is quite convenient for Trump to neglect eras of history in the United States where black individuals were in, as he put it, ?worse shape.? Apparently, Trump forgot the ancient times of less than 60 years ago, where black people were dehumanized, beaten, and shot with fire hoses while they attempted to fight for equal and fair treatment under the law. If Trump were to look at his history book, whichisn going to happen because the only books he owns are about how Hitler was a swell guy,he find itwasn until 1967 that the Supreme Court struck down anti-interracial marriage laws in seventeen states making it legal for black and white people to marry anywhere in the United States. Perhaps the fake billionaire meant that black people were better off in America as slaves? That would be one ofTrump best business concepts towards profits. Trump would reason black individuals would be fools not to prefer slavery, as they would be losing out on confirmed lifelong job security. The pandering by Trump to the vilest racists among his ignorant constituency is no longer a dog whistle, but a blatant declaration that America as a nation is divided by race. He is implicitly longing to return to an era of segregated bathrooms, restaurants, and water fountains. Trump highly preferred America when good honest white folks were given all of the best seats on public transportation, and black people, of who Trump said ?laziness is a trait in black people? is doing them a favor by forcing them to walk to the back of the bus. Trump? deplorable ?s character is on display for all to see, and his ignorant comments have done him no favors in helping to win over a key constituency he needs to win if he hopes to capture the White House.

"One Critically Wounded As Charlotte Police Endure Second Night Of RIOTS? [VIDEO] In a second night of violent protests in Charlotte, North Carolina after a black police officer shot and killed an armed, black suspect, Keith Lamont Scott, things are spiraling out of control and the governor has declared an emergency there. One protester is clinging to life by a thread after being critically wounded by a protester who shot into the crowd randomly. He was hit in the head and is on life support. Three other protesters and four officers were wounded in the chaos. I even heard that protesters tried to throw a reporter into a fire. I also saw white people in their cars with guns for protection. Ican say that I blame them. The NASCAR Hall of Fame and many other businesses were hit by vandals during all of this. The National Guard has now arrived to help fight the increasing violence in Charlotte. From the Daily Mail: National Guard troops have arrived in Charlotte after a protest turned violent on Wednesday night. A state of emergency has been declared in response to the chaos that has taken over the North Carolina city, two days after a father-of-seven was shot dead by a police officer. One of the demonstrators was shot in the head outside the Omni Hotel and is fighting for his life. At least three other protesters and four police officers were also taken to hospital after they were injured in the riot. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV were also attacked while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast. It was the second night of unrest following the deadly shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by black cop, Brentley Vinson, on Tuesday afternoon. Police insist he was armed, but family members maintain he was only reading a book when he was gunned down next to his car. Many businesses and buildings, including the NASCAR Hall of Fame, were hit by vandals and looters. Major companies with offices in the downtown area ? including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Duke Energy ? all told employees to stay away from the area Thursday. Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts is considering putting a curfew in place in a bid to control the disorder. A number of black people defended the police officers, but there were far more that wanted to get their violence on there. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV was attacked, while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast. On Thursday morning, hotel and restaurant employees and security guards started cleaning up dozens of broken windows after protesters smashed buildings and painted the slogan ?Black Lives Matter? on walls. Demonstrators were also seen breaking into a convenience store and a shop that sells merchandise for the NBA franchise, the Charlotte Hornets. Others set fire to trash cans. Some protesters expressed anger at the lawlessness exhibited by fellow demonstrators. One woman was heard shouting, ?Stop ?that not what this is about,? as young men broke bottles in the street. After a black man shot another protester, demonstrators began throwing bottles, dirt clods and fireworks at the officers. The police fired flash grenades and then tear gas back, dispersing the crowd of several hundred. Protesters responded by hurling trash cans and potted plants. A riot is an uncontrollable beast? once you unleash it, it takes on a life of its own and the message is usually lost in the violence and chaos that ensues. I fear this is another step in a race war and all out chaos in our streets. Russia must be smiling.

Rahami, the suspect in Saturday's bombings in New York and New Jersey, was captured Monday. Following a frantic manhunt and shootout, Rahami was shot multiple times before being taken to a hospital for surgery. ""He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world. He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he will probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer,"" Trump said at a Florida rally.

"David Brock is the founder of the left-wing media watchdogMedia Matters for America. It has a stated goal of ?comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media.? Brock is also the head of super PAC in support of Hillary Clinton called Correct the Record. Like Media Matters, Correct the Record seeks to monitor all conservative news and coverage of Hillary Clinton and attempt to debunkany criticism of her. Sincethey also in the business of opposition research,they wanting to pay anyone to come forward with some embarrassing dirt on Donald Trump. As long as the dirt was legallyobtained.They dubbing this project ?TrumpLeaks.? The Washington Free Beacon reported: Brock asked for video or audio of Trump that has yet to be released. ?One of the most important things for voters to evaluate in any election is the full measure of acandidate views, ideas, and temperament over time,? the website states. ?In making a choice for president, voters must also consider how various candidates present themselves to the public and to the world. There are few things more important in that regard than access to video or audio in the form of prior television or radio interviews or more candid video from events a candidate may have attended.?Brock super PAC goes on to say they can offer compensation to anyone who has new video or audio that has been obtained legally. ?TrumpLeaks is an effort to uncover unreported video or audio of Donald Trump so voters can have access to the Donald Trump who existed before running for president and before his recent affinity for teleprompters,? the website says of the project. ?TrumpLeaks can provide some compensation to those who have usable, undoctored video or audio that has been legally obtained or is legally accessible.? NBC News noted that the project is ?highly unusual? and seems to ?cross a new line? in modern day politics. I think the only way in which this is ?crossing a new line? is thatthey so out in the open about it. This is how they get dirt on opponents.It just that acandidate super PACdoesn usually make a public announcement about it.There got to be something out there that someone knows that will be damaging to Donald Trump.Everyone got skeletons in their closet. I imagine that TrumpLeakswill get a hold of it and wait until the most opportune time to release it. If for nothing else, it does show how desperate Hillary Clinton and her surrogates are in trying to make a comeback. It shows thatthey concerned thatthey not going to win.

" After months of quiet, mass shootings once again shake the nation. Around six a.m this morning, a ?disgruntled lawyer? opened fire at a mall in Houston, Texas, injuring nine before he was killed by police officers. Shooter Nathan Desai was found to have had multiple weapons in his vehicle ? all of them legal, as was his right to openly carry his weapons into a public space. As this man was not a Muslim, the media narrative is that Desai was apparently a disgruntledlawyer who was frustrated with hisfirm closing due to lack of customers. But this story gets even weirder. Law enforcement sources said that the shooter was wearing what appeared to be an antique German uniform with swastikas on it, and reports indicate that more Nazi paraphernalia was discovered in his apartment. Why Desai was wearing a Nazi uniform, where he got it, and any relation to white supremacy or neo-Nazi groups are still unclear at the moment. But his attempt to slaughter his countrymen was the 288th mass shooting in this country so far this year, according to watchdog group GunViolenceArchive.org. Texas? absurdly lax weapons laws resulted once again in a man opening fire into innocents. There was no good guy with a gun to save the day; just an angry Nazi lawyer.

"Washington  At a rally in North Carolina on Tuesday, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee states: ""Our African American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever, ever, ever."" The statement is so patently absurd, fact-checking it seems kind of silly. But rather than just give the general response of ""What about slavery?"" or ""How about segregation?"" or ""How about when black people couldn't vote?"" a couple of empirical data points and a bit of history provide just a few examples of how wrong the statement is. The famous and horrifying image of the killing of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith in Marion, Indiana, in 1930. Consider: - A number of black men have been shot and killed by police officers in recent years. That is tragic. But between 1882 and 1931, there were 3,318 black people lynched.

Assistant US Attorney Vikas Khanna said former Christie confidante and Port Authority executive David Wildstein will testify that he told Christie about the plan to close lanes on the George Washington Bridge while it was causing traffic problems in Fort Lee, New Jersey, where the mayor was a political rival of Christie.

" Congressional Black Caucus members demanded that the Justice Department ""aggressively pursue investigations, indictments and prosecutions"" regarding the recent deaths of two black men, which stemmed from fatal police shootings. ""We come to you today to urge you to aggressively pursue investigations, indictments and prosecutions through the Office of Civil Rights against any and all law enforcement officers who harm or kill innocent unarmed black men, women and children,"" said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, reading excerpts from a letter members later presented to Attorney General Loretta Lynch decrying violence. ""We will not continue to ask our constituents to be patient without any hope for change,"" she added. ""Madame Attorney General, you have the unique opportunity and constitutional responsibility to change this narrative."" Caucus Chair G. K. Butterfield said the incidents this week are not isolated. ""The Congressional Black Caucus is outraged with the dozens of unlawful police shootings that are taking place all across America involving unarmed, innocent African-American citizens,"" Butterfield told reporters. ""If we were to identify each of these, it would consume this entire press conference,"" the North Carolina Democrat added. Multiple members of the group, which includes dozens of African-American members of Congress, have spoken out following the death of Terence Crutcher, who was shot and killed last week in Tulsa, Oklahoma, after his car broke down. The 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot him. Crutcher was unarmed at the time. ""He posed no threat. He had no weapon. And yet he was confronted by the Tulsa Police Department and he was both tasered and shot to death,"" said New Jersey Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman in a video posted on the caucus' page. ""This is disgusting. And I am angry and I am hurt."" In a news conference Thursday, Lynch expressed sorrow about the ongoing conflicts between law enforcement and people of color. ""One of my top priorities as attorney general has been to do everything in my power to help heal those divides. And the Department of Justice will continue working tirelessly to protect the rights of all Americans,"" she said. ""We have come together with thoughts and prayers far too many times for victims of violence -- civilians and law enforcement alike,"" she added. Multiple police officers and citizens have been injured this week during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by a police officer. Police say Scott was armed at the time he was fatally shot, but his family claims that he was reading a book in his vehicle when police officers approached and shot him. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said Thursday that the department would not be releasing a video of the encounter between Scott and law enforcement. Rep. Joyce Beatty told CNN's John Berman that lawmakers ""can't be silent."" ""I think transparency is of the utmost. I understand the legalities. I understand that you have to have a full investigation,"" she said on ""At This Hour."" ""We want to make sure that the US Department of Justice is engaged. We want to have independent investigators going into these communities so we take away all doubt or perceptions of the biases,"" the Ohio Democrat said. ""We're losing too many lives."" Both presidential candidates have spoken out this week about the need to improve the relationship between black communities and law enforcement. Hillary Clinton, who the Black Caucus' political action committee endorsed, addressed the shootings in a speech Wednesday in Orlando, Florida. ""There is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African-Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,"" Clinton said. ""It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable."" And Donald Trump said Wednesday he was ""very troubled"" by the fatal police shooting in Tulsa and suggested the officer in question ""got scared"" or was ""choking,"" a slang term for failing under pressure.",0.035196687000000004,0.004140787,0.00621118,0.010351967,0.060041408,0.27743271199999997,0.002070393,2,-1,1
"Rebecca Francis, winner of the reality television show ""Extreme Huntress,"" has been receiving death threats for pictures that she has posted to social media. The photos show her posing next to animals that she has killed while hunting. Metro reported that the Utah native has killed bears, moose, zebras and antelopes during her hunting career. She recently posed with a big smile next to a dead giraffe and posted it to Facebook. Many social media users reacted negatively; some even said that they wished the hunter was dead. Twitter user @AsapGinger1 wrote, ?I know this is very hypocritical of me but I want to f****** shoot her just for this picture.? Actor Ricky Gervais is also an animal rights supporter and tweeted the photo of Francis next to the dead giraffe. His message was retweeted more than 17,000 times. According to the Independent, Francis has eight children. However, multiple pregnancies and babies have not prevented her from hunting in the United States and Africa. ?We hunt elk and deer every year without fail, even through pregnancy, and nursing babies. Our hunting trips are self-guided,? she said. Francis has also hosted the television show ""Eye of the Hunter."" She claims to have killed a wide range of animals, including, ?A 10 1/2 ft. brown bear, black bear, shiras moose, alaskan moose, dall sheep, stone sheep, desert bighorn ram, rocky mountain bighorn ram, mule deer, whitetail deer, elk, mountain goat, antelope, arapawa ram, kudu, zebra, black wildebeest, giraffe, springbuck, blesbuck, lynx, badger, and squirrel.?

" The New York Times has joined a number of other major print media publications in denouncing Donald Trump as a liar. Writers at Quartz have noted that ?in at least five articles in the New York Times on Sept. 17, including the lead story in the print edition, the words ?lie,? ?false,? ?falsely claimed? and untrueappeared in headlines, lead paragraphs, and top sections of thepaper Trump coverage. Executive editor Dean Baquet? said that ?I think our investigativework [the Sept. 17] story onTrump taxbreaks always been hard hitting. But we have decided to be more direct in calling things out when a candidate actuallylies birther issue represents, well, outright lying. And he lied over a long period. It is a real word and we will use it when warranted.? Hopefully this dramatic shift in tone will be a cue to the rest of the mainstream media to abandon their insistence on treatingTrump statements with more legitimacy than they deserve out of a desire to remain impartial. The right-wing has been exploiting that impartiality for far too long. The Republican primary debates were filled with outright falsehoods and imaginary statistics that largely went unchallenged; andTrump entire campaign is based on statements which are simply untrue. But it appears thatTrump attempt to gaslight the nation and convince us that it was actually Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton that created the birthermyth (which is decidedly false) was the last straw for the highly respected editors at the New York Times.

"Story highlights Hillary Clinton's response to suspected bombings contrasts with her opponent Donald Trump The Democratic presidential nominee says she's 'ready' to tackle terror White Plains, New York (CNN) Hillary Clinton cast herself Monday morning as the only presidential candidate who has fought terrorism and slammed Donald Trump's response to the incidents in New York, New Jersey and Minnesota over the weekend as ""demagogic."" In a news conference on the tarmac of Westchester County Airport, the Democratic presidential nominee said she has been ""part of the hard decision to take terrorists off the battlefield,"" and contrasted her steadiness to what she called Trump's ""irresponsible, reckless rhetoric."" ""It is like so much else he says: It is not grounded in fact, it is meant to make some kind of demagogic point,"" Clinton said. ""I am prepared to, ready to actually take on those challenges, not engage in a lot of irresponsible, reckless rhetoric."" An explosive device went off in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan over the weekend, once again thrusting the politics of terror into the center of the 2016 election. Clinton and Trump initially responded to the incident in contrasting styles: Trump was quick to announce that a bomb had gone off in New York, even before there was much information about the incident; Clinton, meanwhile, urged caution, and the importance of waiting to draw conclusions until more information was available.

" Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump offered vastly different proposals Wednesday to change police practices following fatal shootings of African-American men in Oklahoma and North Carolina. When asked how he would stop violence in the black community, Trump said he would take the controversial stop-and-frisk practice nationwide. ""I think you have to,"" the Republican nominee said at a town hall with Fox News host and Trump supporter Sean Hannity. ""We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.""

""To me it looked like he did everything you're supposed to do. And he looked like a really good man."" Christie vs. Clinton Meanwhile, one of Trump's top supporters -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- lambasted Clinton for her response on conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham's show. In a radio interview Tuesday, Clinton had cited the need to address ""systemic racism"" and ""implicit bias"" in police forces -- while praising ""honorable, cool-headed police officers."" Christie labeled those remarks a ""disgrace"" Wednesday. ""She's a disgrace. She's a disgrace and those comments are a disgrace,"" Christie said Wednesday on ""The Laura Ingraham Show."" ""It's typical of Hillary Clinton. She knows nothing but the mouth never stops."" Trump, however, has also displayed a tendency to speak about events before all the facts are made clear. He notably called the explosion in New York City over the weekend a ""bomb"" 30 minutes after the incident, despite a lack of official confirmation. African-American outreach The shootings come as Trump and Clinton confront unique challenges with African-American voters. Clinton's weakness is among millennial voters across the board -- many of whom have told pollsters they are gravitating toward Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein. Trump, meanwhile, is attempting to chip into Clinton's commanding lead among African-American voters overall while also appealing to white voters who tend to support the GOP but have been turned off by his rhetoric. That effort hit turbulence Wednesday when Trump campaigned alongside long-time boxing promoter Don King Wednesday in Ohio. King, who is black, used the N-word while introducing Trump, arguing that African-Americans cannot achieve success while emulating whites because they will remain ""negroes."" ""If you're poor, you are a poor negro -- I would use the n-word -- but if you're rich, you are a rich negro. If you are intelligent, intellectual, you are intellectual negro. If you are a dancing and sliding and gliding n***** -- I mean negro -- you are a dancing and sliding and gliding negro,"" King said, laughing along with the crowd after the slip-up. ""You're going to be a negro 'til you die."" Trump also caused controversy Tuesday night when he told a nearly all-white crowd in North Carolina that ""we're going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before. Ever. Ever. Ever."" His remark -- ignoring the nation's deeply flawed history of slavery, Jim Crow laws, segregation and more -- drew a stern rebuke Wednesday from Rep. John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and hero of the civil rights movement. ""Is he saying that the conditions are worse than slavery? Is he saying that the conditions are worse than the signs that I that saw when I was growing up that said 'white men,' 'colored men,' 'white women,' 'colored women?'"" Lewis said. ""Where is he coming from?""",0.017652251,0.001765225,0.002353633,0.006766696,0.027949397,0.217416887,0.0008826130000000001,2,-1,1
" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani accused the United States Thursday of ""a lack of compliance"" with the nuclear deal agreed between Tehran and world powers last July. Speaking to global leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Rouhani then attacked the US for what he described as ""illegal actions,"" referring to the US Supreme Court decision in April to allow US victims of terror to claim nearly $2 billion in compensation from Iran's central bank. The decision allows impounded Iranian assets to be distributed to more than 1,000 US survivors of terror attacks for which the US deems Iranian groups responsible. Rouhani blamed the ruling on the influence of ""Zionist pressure groups"" in Washington. Success of 'moderation' But the Iranian President, who faces an election in May and has been sharply criticized by hardliners for making concessions the US to accomplish the nuclear pact, did offer some positive words about the agreement. The ability of Iran and world powers to negotiate the deal indicates ""the success we can achieve through moderation, constructive interaction, dialogue -- the policy that brought an end to a long, complicated and unnecessary crisis by adopting a win-win approach,"" he told the gathered international luminaries. He added that ""it was a political deal that also represents a creative method ... to resolving international challenges."" But Rouhani still lit into the US at one point for its ""lack of compliance"" with the terms, saying that ""represents a flawed approach that should be rectified forthwith."" And he warned Washington that any failure to implement it ""will further erode the credibility of the US in the world."" US rejects accusations The US rejected the accusation that it is failing to keep up its end of the bargain. ""The United States has and will continue to implement its commitments under the deal with good faith and without exception,"" said a US State Department official, who added America has ""unequivocally met"" its terms and has ""made absolutely clear that we are committed to full and effective implementation of our sanctions-related commitments."" After Iran agreed to limit its nuclear activities, years of tough economic sanctions were lifted under the deal, allowing Tehran's oil to be sold internationally. Iran has been frustrated that it has not seen more of an economic benefit stemming from the deal, with many countries still wary of doing business with the country. Spread of terror Rouhani's critique didn't stop there, blaming global powers' post 9/11 security strategies for ""the genesis of borderless violence and terrorism"" in the world. Speaking in New York 15 years after the mass terror attack, he said that ""no one imagined that this occurrence would lead to larger disasters resulting in a devastating war in the Middle East and the spread of insecurity across the globe."" He pointed to the plight of the Syrian, Iraqi, Yemeni, Afghan and Palestinian people, while calling on neighbors to ""stop bombing each other and accept responsibility for past mistakes"". Saudi Arabia Iran's President also pointed his finger at regional rival Saudi Arabia, warning that the country must ""cease and desist from divisive policies"" if peace is to be found in the Middle East. ""If the Saudi government is serious about its vision for development and regional security, it must cease and desist from divisive policies, spread of hate ideology, and trampling upon the rights of neighbors,"" Rouhani told world leaders. Shi'ite-led Iran and the Saudi Arabian Sunni monarchy are on opposing sides of the Syrian conflict, with Iran sending forces and advisers to back Syrian President Bashar al-Assad while its rival supports Syrian rebel groups. They are also divided over Yemen. The Saudis have accused Iran of backing the Houthi rebels, who seized power from the government in March. At least 30 Yemeni civilians were killed Wednesday in Saudi-led airstrikes in the port region of Hodieda.",0.01754386,0.002192982,0.010964912,0.006578947,0.061403509,0.291666667,0.026315789,2,-1,1

"There's hope that the U.S.-sponsored event on Tuesday will lead to tangible results. | AP Photo Terror attacks complicate Obama's refugee push UNITED NATIONS ? The New York-area hunt for an Afghan-born bombing suspect cast a pall on this week's gathering of international leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, a session U.S. President Barack Obama plans to use to rally support for helping the world's refugees. Instead, the search for and eventual capture Monday of 28-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami gave a fresh talking point to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who wants to dramatically curtail U.S. admissions of refugees and other immigrants and who has criticized his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton's more welcoming stance. Story Continued Below ""I just saw that and wanted to weep,"" a U.S.-based refugee advocate told POLITICO as news spread of the manhunt. ""Trump is going to be all over this bullshit."" And he was. ""Think of it,"" the real estate mogul told Fox News on Monday morning. ""Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands of these same people that are, you know, they have such hatred and sickness in their hearts.It sickness, butit ?it sickness andit hatred, and she wants to allow hundreds of thousands."" Clinton responded, in a hastily arranged news conference on an airplane tarmac near her New York home, with a reiteration of her call for stricter ""vetting"" of immigrants and an ""intelligence surge"" to better identify terrorist threats. ""So I am absolutely in favor of and have long been an advocate for tough vetting for making sure that we don't let people into this country, and not just people who come here to settle, but we need a better visa system,"" she said. But she sought to distinguish between terrorists like the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks and refugees in general, while taking a shot at Trump for good measure. ""These were not refugees who got into airplanes and attacked our city and our country,"" Clinton said. ""So let's not get diverted and distracted by the kind of campaign rhetoric we hear coming from the other side."" Authorities were still piecing together details about Rahami, a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Afghanistan but whose last known address was in Elizabeth, New Jersey. According to media reports, he was wounded in a shootout with police in Linden, New Jersey, but taken into custody by noon Monday. He is wanted in connection with a blast that hurt 29 people over the weekend in the Chelsea area of New York City, as well as other bombs found in the city and in New Jersey. It was not immediately clear how Rahami reached the United States, or whether he even arrived as a refugee. But activists acknowledged that such nuances would likely get lost in the debate this week as terrorism will likely become an even more prominent issue than it already is. This year's General Assembly, and the many events on the sidelines, are tackling issues ranging from how to stop growing microbial resistance to antibiotics to climate change. The bloody civil war in Syria, the battle against the Islamic State terrorist network and the dilemma over North Korea's nuclear program are also key topics. The world's refugee crisis ? in which an unprecedented 65 million people are either displaced in their own countries or sought help in other states ? is receiving special attention, however. On Monday, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon kicked off a summit of world leaders to discuss the topic. And on Tuesday, Obama will host his own refugee summit. Of huge concern is the plight of Syrian refugees, hundreds of thousands of whom have trekked to Europe to escape the despair of refugee camps. During his opening remarks on Monday morning, Ban, who will leave the secretary-general's seat in just a few months, called on nations not to be afraid of refugees fleeing violence and persecution. ""Refugees and migrants are not to be seen a burden; they offer great potential, if only we unlock it,"" he said. ""Acting together, we can respond to rising xenophobia and turn fear into hope."" As the U.N.-sponsored summit kicked off, millions of people in the New York area received alerts on their cell phones about the search for Rahami, who authorities warned was likely armed and dangerous. Refugee advocates say they have mixed feelings about the two summits. They believe the U.N.-sponsored event Monday is falling short of concrete steps groups such as Amnesty International and Oxfam sought. The leaders gathered Monday adopted the so-called New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, but the statement puts off much of the heavy lifting of coming up with a new strategy for handling mass migration crises until 2018. There's more hope that the U.S.-sponsored event on Tuesday will lead to tangible results, including serious commitments from the private sector on ways to assist refugees. But activists are disappointed that while Obama is calling on other countries to double their intake of refugees, he isn't willing to lift the U.S. intake as much. Obama has set a target of 110,000 refugee admissions, including a significant number from Syria, in fiscal year 2017; some activists had hoped for 200,000. Opposition among Republicans in Congress, which controls funding for the U.S. refugee resettlement program, likely stayed Obama's hand. Clinton said last year that she'd like to see the U.S. accept some 65,000 refugees from Syria; but in the year since, she's stayed silent on any numbers. Her campaign stresses that while Clinton believes in keeping the U.S. refugee resettlement program intact as a symbol of American generosity, she believes newcomers must be properly screened. Her relative reticence on the subject ? at least as compared to Trump ? has rankled some refugee advocates, who now wonder whether, with the latest attack in New York, whether she will become even more shy. ""It's really important that Hillary make a strong statement supporting the fiscal year 2017 admissions goals set by President Obama and make a commitment to continue to increase our annual refugee admissions once she's elected,"" said Yasmine Taeb of the Friends Committee on National Legislation, a Quaker lobby. Taeb acknowledged the ""tough political climate,"" noting ""the rise in anti-Muslim and anti-refugee rhetoric."" But she urged world leaders not to ""turn our backs on innocent women, men, and children fleeing violence and persecution."" Trump, Clinton and Obama were all set to hold bilateral meetings with world leaders in New York on Monday. Clinton and Trump are due to meet Egypt's president, while Clinton also will meet Ukraine's president and the prime minister of Japan. Obama's meetings include one with Iraq's prime minister; the pair will likely discuss ways to keep up the fight against the Islamic State. Nolan D.

"Bryan R. Smith/AFP/Getty Images | Getty Images Fourth Estate Was the Terror Coverage More Explosive Than the Bombs? Goaded by politicians and cable, a safer-than-ever America goes into full red alert mode. In a rational world, we would interpret the inept crimes of accused pipe bomber Ahmad Khan Rahami as evidence that 15 years after the big one, the terrorist threat in America is akin to a brushfire kind of thing that inevitably flares up and causes some damage before the experts put it out. Instead, thanks to the cable news channels and some in the Web and print space,we turned it into a mighty conflagration. Donald Trump, ever the opportunist, sounded this alarm Saturday shortly after the bomb went off inManhattan Chelsea district. ?Nobody knows exactlywhat going on. But boy, we are living in atime better get very tough, folks,? Trump said, when the shrapnel was still sizzling. The cable news channels jumped on the story in a galvanic fashion for a number of reasons. First, the story happened in their New York backyard. It is an unwritten rule of assaults, murders, natural disasters and other injurious acts that their news potential is inversely proportional to the distance from the newsorganization headquarters. For example, if a pipe bomb went off in Kansas City, the news response of the New York-based networks would be middling. But if a New York City cop broke his toe kicking a suspect in the butt,we be just a few chyrons away from a breaking news alert. Story Continued Below Second, the detonation of one bomb is an indicator that additional bombs might exist until proved otherwise. In this case, they did, in alarming numbers. The multiplicity ofdevices bomb exploded in New Jersey on Saturday morning, a second bomb was found (undetonated) in Manhattan, and then early Monday in New Jersey a third bomb went off in the face of a policerobot the story additional velocity like booster stages on a rocket. Third, the date 9/11 has made us all a little anxious about a repeat attack in September, and this anxiety helps to stoke coverage of any suchincident in New York. Even if the networks were based in Chicago, the story would have become big news: Terrorism is to New York as hurricanes are to Miami. Even the near-misses are big stories. So, measured by the usual yardsticks, nobody can deny that the New York bombing story and the capture of the accused were big stories.I be the last person to say the press ?over-covered? an incident in which 29 people were injured. But neither am I carrying a load of dread that the next pipe bomb will ignite in myworld Washington, D.C., metro area, another bull's-eye for terrorists. Living, as I do, in a rational world, I interpret the clumsy bombing and misfire, and the speedy apprehension of the suspect, as evidence that the genuine threat from terrorists is low. Very low. I feel safe unless I start watching TV, after which, if I let my reptilian brain take over, I feel a bit panicked. You probably feel the same way. After all,there no cost to overreacting to the minor threat of terrorism. The payoff for overreacting could be the preservation of your life. President Barack Obama has tried to convey this gist of the low threat a number of times, but whenever he tries to assure the country, it comes out sounding likehe counseling us to put our heads in the sand. Then, opportunists like Trump do us no favor by inflating the event into something itisn. ?Once again someone we were told is OK turns out to be a terrorist who wants to destroy our country & itspeople did he get thru system?? Trump tweeted Monday afternoon. The fact that the 28-year-old Rahami, born in Afghanistan, is the naturalized son of an immigrant seems not to have penetrated Trump's coiffure. If Rahami ?got through the system,? he did so as a youth. The current spate of violencedoesn even come close to the volume of bombings recorded by FBI statisticians in an 18-month period spanning 1971 and 1972, Bryan Burrough reports in his book Days of Rage. Despite more than 2,500 domestic bombings in that period, the nation did not lose its marbles; no demagogue campaigned on the peril they posed. Because fear is not rational, wonks never get too far with the public by explaining that backyard swimming pools, quick drives to the supermarket for bread and milk, obesity or falling furniture are more likely to put your indeath cross hairs than an act of terrorism. In the current atmosphere, every terror-motivated crime has come to feel like a dire assault on the homeland, exploding in the news with much more success than the actual bombs involved. Though the fear is understandable, the result has a huge distorting effect on our national psyche and politics. The culture appears to be too scarred by the 9/11 attacks to place pressure-cooker bombs of the type that Rahami is alleged to have built in their proper perspective. Maybe the next generation, one with no direct memory of the attack, can guide us out of our paranoia. The fact is, everywhere you look in modern life,we safer. Airline flight is safer, cars are ridiculously safe, violent crime has fallen through the floor, the food supply has never been safer, and consumer devices come with so many safety doodads attached that it takes an act of determined negligence to cut off a finger or put out an eye. Helmeted to avoid concussions, GPS'ed up the wing-wang to make it impossible to get lost in the forest, protected by surveillance cameras around the clock, we now live in a fully airbagged world, where accidental death is blocked by technology at almost every juncture. The paradox of all this safety is that it ends up making a lot of us feel all the more unsafe whenwe reminded that random tragedies dohappen to clamor for an even bigger airbag when they do, even though the rational mind tells uswe reached a diminishing point of returns on that investment.I not counseling anybody to ?get over? 9/11 and slough off new attacks as ifthey pinpricks. But neither am I encouraging everybody to throw themselves into a full 9/11 wallow every time a bomb explodes, even if it blows up right in Manhattan. The low, low risk that a terrorist attack might injure you may not deserve the round-the-clock coverage the current incident is getting. It deserves some, and the press should feel free to pick on the 9/11 scab as much as itlikesit not too much to ask the press to toss a little ointment and a bandage on the wound every now and then. ******* My autobiography will be titled A Little Ointment and a Bandage.

"Brad Paisleydoesn seem like one who would call out any other dude, but apparently he is! Brad Paisley is one of our favorite country artists, and he has more American pride than almost any other country artist. Although we were surprised at his latest statement, we kind ofweren surprised at the same time. If you have any kind of social media, or you read the news anywhere you have probably heard about a man by the name of Colin Kaepernick. He is the San Fransisco 49ers quarterback and he refused to stand up during the National Anthem. Of course, this caused a lot of controversy all over the U.S considering the fact that football isAmerica sport. Kaepernick stated his reasoning behind sitting during the National Anthem and it only madeAmerican moremad most of them at least. ?I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people ofcolor me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.? In response to his comment his team made a statement saying that it is an individuals choice to choose wether they stand for the anthem or not. ?The national anthem is and always will be a special part of the pre-game ceremony. It is an opportunity to honor our country and reflect on the great liberties we are afforded as its citizens. In respecting such American principles as freedom of religion and freedom of expression, we recognize the right of an individual to choose and participate, or not, in our celebration of the national anthem.? Thisdidn set well with Brad Paisley though, and he made sure that his fans knew hedidn supportKaepernick decisions. The country star was recently performing at then PNC Music Pavilion in Charlotte and a video came up behind him that had fans rolling laughing. Paisley was performing a fan favorite song Celebritythat talks about stars who let fame get to their heads.It a humorous song, but the best part was the video that was playing behind Paisley while he sand the song. The video was of making fun of celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Justin Bieber, and Donald Trump. The crowd was laughing hysterically but then a video of a cartoon Kaepernick was kneeling on the football field and other players were standing around him! The crowds tone changed quick and they turned their laughs into yelling and BOOING.

"Story highlights Clinton said Trump does not share the values of young voters Her campaign needs to keep millennials from voting for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein Philadelphia (CNN) Hillary Clinton made a direct appeal Monday to a demographic group that continues to be deeply skeptical of the Democratic nominee: millennials. Addressing a largely younger crowd here at Temple University, Clinton argued that her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, does not share their values, and that in contrast, she has fought her entire life for children and young people and would be their biggest advocate in the White House. Clinton said that young people she has spoken with to over the course of this campaign have expressed concerns about divisiveness and discrimination. ""Too many young black men and women made to feel like their lives are disposable; too many immigrants living in fear of deportation; too many young LGBT Americans, bullied; too many young women and men assaulted,"" Clinton said. Clinton emphasized efforts to promote affordable tuition and combat college debt. These topics were at the core of the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders -- the raspy, populist Vermont senator who proved to be formidable challenger to Clinton as he overwhelmingly won the support of young people and liberals.

"The conflicting accounts came after Donald Trump on Friday accused Hillary Clinton of starting what he called ?the birthercontroversy."" | AP Photo Did Sid Blumenthal really push birtherism? He says no, but he did urge journalists to look into Barack Obama's ties to Kenya back in 2008. DonaldTrump campaign is claiming vindication after one of HillaryClinton longtime confidants was accused last week of spreading false rumors about BarackObama origins during the 2008 Democratic primary. But the real story turns out to be a little more complicated, and does nothing to proveTrump argument that Clinton and her campaign startedthe so-called birther controversy. Story Continued Below Last Thursday, after former McClatchy editor James Asher tweeted that Clinton associate Sidney Blumenthal ?told me in person? that Obama was born in Kenya, the Trump campaign pounced. ?SIREN: Former McClatchy DC Bureau Chief speaks out,? senior communications adviser Jason Miller tweeted. McClatchy followed up with a story that quoted a statement from Asher, ?During that meeting, Mr. Blumenthal and I met together in my office and he strongly urged me to investigate the exact place of PresidentObama birth, which he suggested was in Kenya. We assigned a reporter to go to Kenya, and that reporter determined that the allegation was false.? Blumenthal swiftly denied pushing any birther rumors. And Asher, when pressed for more detail, was less definitive in an email to POLITICO. ?To the best of my recollection, these are the facts about my interaction with Sidney Blumenthal in late winter of 2008,? Asher said. ?Blumenthal visited the Washington Bureau of McClatchy, where he and I met in my office. During that conversation and in subsequent communications, we discussed a number of matters related to Obama. He encouraged McClatchy to do stories related to Obama and his connections to Kenya.? ?On the birther issue, I recall my conversation with Blumenthal clearly,? Asher said, but acknowledged having ?nothing in writing memorializing that conversation.? ?This story is false,? Blumenthal reiterated in an email. ?I never spoke to Mr. Asher about this. Period. Donald Trump cannot distract from the inescapable fact that he is the one who embraced and promoted the birther lie and is responsible for it.? ?Well I still have his biz card. So it's his word against mine,? Asher tweeted on Friday after other news outlets publishedBlumenthal initial denial. But two other former McClatchy staffers, includingMcClatchy Nairobi correspondent at the time, Shashank Bengali, said they were aware that Asher and Blumenthal were in touch. ?Sid was definitely speaking to Asher,? Bengali said. Bengali, who is now a Los Angeles Times correspondent based in Mumbai, said he had been asked to investigate ?Obama?s Kenya ties? atBlumenthal behest, butcouldn remember whether anyone had asked him ?to check out the birther angle specifically. No one in Kenya took that seriously."" ?What I remember is that you told me to look into everything about Obama's family in Kenya. I can't recall if we specifically discussed the birther claim, but I'm sure that was part of what I researched,? Bengali said in an email to Asher that was shared with POLITICO. Bengali interviewed Obama's siblings and friends of his father, but came up empty. ?There was nothing there. We didn't even publish a story,"" he said. Blumenthalwon say if the meeting with Asher ever happened, but did not deny urging him in an email to have Bengali report on whether Obama had offended Kenyans by making disparaging remarks about his late father, an economist who once worked for the Kenyan government. The email, which was dated March 17, 2008, and shared with POLITICO, reads: ""Jim, on Kenya your person in the field might look into the impact there of Obama's public comments about his father. I'm told by State Dept officials that Obama publicly derided his father on his visit there and that was regarded as embarrassing and crossing the line by Kenyans for whom respect for elders (especially the father, especially a Muslim father, in a patrilineal society) is considered sacrosanct. Sidney"" Asher says he also asked Bengali, after discussing the matter with Blumenthal, to look into ?any connections between Obama and Raila Odinga, who had described himself asObama cousin and would run for president of Kenya; and, second, possible relationships between Odinga and unspecified controversial Muslim groups.? Asked about the email, Blumenthal would not clarify the nature of his interactions with Asher. But he wrote, ?What you sent has nothing to do with birtherism at all. It is untrue I had anything to do with birtherism. Obama's relationship with his father is at the heart of his memoir, ?Dreams of My Father,? and has been a commonplace subject of interest for everyone.? Nor would Blumenthal say if he had discussed ties between Obama and Odinga with Asher. ?I can say with certainty that I never trafficked in birtherism,? he repeated when asked. Blumenthal sent along an email he sent to friends in February 2011, pointing to POLITICO ?s write-up of a poll showing that half of Republican primary voters at the time that Obama was born abroad. He said his subject line -- ?It's official: they're nuts? -- ?reflects my constant view of the matter.? He also pointed to a series of tweets Asher made in which he attacked Clinton in strident terms and used a pro-Trump hashtag. ?#Snowden should be pardoned since #hillary wasn't #indicted. Only fair! #wikileaks #Election2016,? one tweet reads. ?#HillaryClinton #Election2016 #TrumpPence16 Note Colin #Powell's reference to #HRC's #?character,?"" reads another. A third tweet reads: ?What is really going on with #HillaryClinton? #Election2016 # HillarysHealth.? Asked about those tweets on Monday, Asher said, ?I support neither Trump nor Clinton. It would be incorrect to read support for Trump into my tweets about Clinton.? The conflicting accounts came after Trump on Friday accused Clinton of starting what he called ?the birthercontroversy? -- a campaign of scurrilous rumor-mongering that he did more than anyone to stoke, only to concede last week that he was mistaken. The Clintoncampaign response toTrump charge came fast and furious, and POLITICO found no evidence to suggest that the former secretary of state or her 2008 operation ever trafficked in birther rumors. ""As multiple, independent fact checkers have affirmed in the years since, neither the 2008 campaign nor the candidate ever questioned the president's citizenship or birth certificate,? Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon said when asked about Blumenthal, who was never paid by the 2008 Clinton campaign. Indeed,Clinton former campaign manager, Patty Solis Doyle, told CNN on Friday that she fired a volunteer coordinator in Iowa who had forwarded a birther-esque email, calling it ?so beyond the pale of the campaign Hillary wanted to run.? Blumenthal, a longtime confidant of both Bill and Hillary Clinton, emerged as a frequent correspondent in the former secretary ofstate email records, peppering her with hundreds of notes offering advice, sharing tart observations about her administration rivals, or passing along articles and intelligencereports from his contacts. He also sometimes boasted of having planted articles in the press on her behalf, though there is no evidence that she ever asked him to do so.Blumenthal relationship with the Clintons dates back to their battles with the right-wing media during the 1990s, in which he was a sharp-elbowed participant. After writing a well-received book about those years, ?The Clinton Wars,? he returned briefly to journalism before playing an informal advisory role during the 2008 campaign. He sought a job in the State Department when Clinton was named secretary of state, but White House aides blacklisted him due to his role in pushing negative stories about Obama during the Democratic primary. He remained in the Clinton orbit, however: In 2009, the Clinton Foundation put him on its staff and paid him $10,000 per month , though the arrangement ended in March 2015. Blumenthal then did consulting work for American Bridge, Correct the Record and Media Matters, three groups that supportClinton presidential bid and are run by another close Clinton ally, David Brock. In a portion of a deposition that was accidently put online, Blumenthal told a congressional committee that he was paid around $200,000 by the Brock groups. Hillary Clinton has never repudiated Blumenthal, though she has distanced herself from him, while he has continued to be her ardent defender. As recently as May, he described himself as a friendofClinton, though he did not say whether they still exchange emails. In her testimony before the House Benghazi Committee last year, Clinton described him as a ?personal friend? but downplayed the extent to which she relied on him for advice as secretary of state. ""He was not advising me,"" Clinton told the committee. ""I did not ask him to send me the information that he sent me,"" she said, though the emails show that she did sometimes thank him for the information or ask him to ?please keep them coming.? She also sometimes forwarded his emails and asked State Department officials to look into his findings. During her subsequent interview with the FBI, Clinton described him as ?a prodigious writer whose information was sometimes accurate and sometimes not,? according to thebureau report summarizing its investigation into her private email server. WhenBlumenthal emails first emerged, Clinton was slightly less circumspect. ?He sent me unsolicited emails, which I passed on in some instances, and I say thatthat just part of the give and take,? she told reporters last year. ?I have many, many old friends and I always think thatit important when you get into politics to have friends you had before you were in politics and to understandwhat on their minds,? Clinton said. ?Andhe been a friend of mine for a long time.?",0.035413152999999996,0.001686341,0.002529511,0.009274874,0.075885329,0.215851602,0.002529511,2,-1,1

Arpaio told POLITICO of the GOP nominee's statement. ?Hedidn say the document was legitimate. Hedidn go that route.? Story Continued Below OfTrump statement onObama birthplace, Arpaio added: ?Itdidn bother me.? Arpaio, a prominent Trump supporter known for his hard-line views on immigration, opened an investigation into the legitimacy ofObama birth certificate in August 2011, several months after the White House published it online, further demonstrating that he was, in fact, born in Hawaii. Trump rose to political prominence in part through insinuating, falsely, that Obama was not born in the United States ? a claim thepresident supporters have long decried as racist. He backed down from it under pressure last week, in a short statement at an otherwise drawn-out press conference at his new luxury hotel in Washington. Trump also attempted to blame his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for starting the rumor, another claim independent fact checkers have debunked. But while Trump has sought to sidestep the birther issue, Arpaio has refused to back down from his own claim thatObama birth certificate was forged.

On Wednesday, Arpaio told POLITICO the investigation into the document is ongoing.

There's at least one Muslim country that Donald Trump has ""great respect"" for. The Republican presidential nominee Monday showered Egypt's increasingly autocratic ruler, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, with kind words during a special meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. Story Continued Below Trump, who has called for a ban on immigration from countries ""compromised by terrorism,"" which presumably would include Egypt, promised to invite Sisi to visit the White House if he's elected president. Trump also suggested he'd like to visit Egypt. In a strikingly praise-filled summary of the meeting released by his campaign, the Republican was said to express to Sisi ""his strong support forEgypt war on terrorism, and how under a Trump administration, the United States of America will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that Egypt can count on in the days and years ahead."" Trump also was said to have ""emphasized"" to Sisi ""his high regard for peace-loving Muslims."" The statement came the same day that the real estate mogul, responding to a suspected terrorist attack in New York, lamented that police officers weren't allowed to use racial profiling. Sisi also met with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Both the 2016 candidates have been criticized by people across the political spectrum for sparing any time for Sisi, whose harsh rule has infuriated human rights activists. But Egypt is still considered a vital ally for the United States, not least because it maintains a peace deal with Israel and is a relatively stable Arab country in an increasingly volatile Middle East. It also is considered an important partner in the battle against Islamist militancy. The meeting between Trump and Sisi also included Trump advisers, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. According to the readout, Trump expressed ""great respect forEgypt history"" and a ""great fondness"" for the Egyptian people.

""And in difficult and life-threatening situations, mistakes are made and people have to be held to strict account, but we both believe that it's important that we have a president who, as the chief law enforcement officer of the United States, stands behind the men and women who serve in law enforcement."" Story Continued Below Pence said that police officers are ""the best of us."" ""We ought to set aside this talk, this talk about institutional racism and institutional bias,"" he said, calling such assertions ""rhetoric of division."" Asked by Bishop John Brannon, who is African-American, what Pence would ""personally do"" to heal divides in the country, Pence brought up the recent shootings. ""When there's any loss of life, we have to speak with compassion, we have to make it clear that there will be a thorough investigation and that justice will be served and that high standards will be upheld,"" Pence said. Pence sought to strike a tone of unity in his remarks, repeating that ""there will always be more that unites us in this country than could ever divide us."" At a town hall event shortly after the pastors roundtable, Pence used the same line ? that there is too much talk of ""institutional racism"" ? to take aim at Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. ""But in the wake of these tragic events in Tulsa and Charlotte, sadly our opponent once again refers to what she calls the institutional racism in law enforcement,"" Pence said. ""We heard this week again of the 'systemic racism' in law enforcement in this country."" Pence said people expect a ""thorough, immediate and transparent investigation"" in the wake of police shootings. Pence went on to say that police are ""not a force for racism in America, they are a force for good, they stand for our families, they protect our homes and they deserve our support and respect."" He also said he respected protesters' constitutional right to assemble, but added ""there is no right to engage in violence against our citizens or against our property.""

"In a shocking, sudden turn of events, one of thecountry most controversial cases that went to court over a year ago has just ended with all charges dropped against this person. Three others involved in this massive news piece have also been exonerated. While there will be much excitement over this stunning decision, there are likely to be riots as well from the opposition. Was justice effective served? It depends on where you stand on the issue of what this crimewas. Barack Hussein Obama was thispatriot biggest nemesis whose orders led to a deadly standoff. With a new president in charge, things have changed dramatically on one of thecountry biggest cases that would have gone much differently had President Donald Trump not been in office. Fox News reports: A federal judge dismissed all charged against rancher Cliven Bundy and three others U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro cited ?flagrant prosecutorial misconduct? in her decision to dismiss all charges against rancher Cliven Bundy, two of his sons and another person. This comes after a standoff two years ago that ended in a court battle that began in October of 2017. Fox explains the unprecedented move made today that was not expected: The embarrassment a federal judge dealt to government prosecutors last month in the Cliven Bundy case could be set to resume Monday, at a hearing to determine whether the cattle rancher who became a folk hero long before he beat the feds can be retried. U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro on Dec. 20 declared a mistrial in the high-profile case. It was only the latest, stunning development in the saga of the Nevada rancher, and served as a repudiation of the federal government. Navarro accused prosecutors of willfully withholding evidence fromBundy lawyers, in violation of the federal Brady rule. The Brady rule, named after the landmark 1963 Supreme Court case known as Brady v. Maryland, holds that failure to disclose such evidence violates adefendant right to due process. ?In this case the failures to comply with Brady were exquisite, extraordinary,? said Fox News legal analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano. ?The judge exercised tremendous patience.? The 71-year-oldBundy battle with the federal government eventually led to what became known as the Bundy standoff of 2014. But it began long before that. In the early 1990s, the U.S. government limited grazing rights on federal lands in order to protect the desert tortoise habitat. In 1993, Bundy, in protest, refused to renew his permit for cattle grazing, and continued grazing his livestock on these public lands. Hedidn recognize the authority of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) over the sovereign state of Nevada. The federal courts sided with the BLM, and Bundydidn seem to have a legal leg to stand on. Nevertheless, the rancher and the government continued this dispute for 20 years, and Bundy ended up owing over $1 million in fees and fines. Things came to a head in 2014, when officials planned to capture and impound cattle trespassing on government land. Protesters, many armed, tried to block the authorities, which led to a standoff. For a time, they even shut down a portion of I-15, the main interstate highway running through Southern Nevada. Tensions escalated until officials, fearing for the general safety, announced they would returnBundy cattle and suspend the roundup. Afterward, Bundy continued to graze his cattle and not pay fees. He and his fellow protesters were heroes to some, but criminals to the federal government. Bundy, along with others seen as leaders of the standoff, including sons Ammon and Ryan, were charged with numerous felonies, including conspiracy, assault on a federal officer and using a firearm in a violent crime. They faced many years in prison. The Bundy case finally began in late October, 2017. But just two months later, it ended with Navarro angry, the feds humiliated and Bundy ? at least to his supporters ? vindicated. In fact, Navarro had suspended the trial earlier and warned of a mistrial when prosecutors released information after a discovery deadline. Overall, the government was late in handing over more than 3,300 pages of documents. Further, some defense requests for information that ultimately came to light had been ridiculed by prosecutors as fantasticaland a ?fishing expedition.? ?Either the government lied or [it?s actions were] so grossly negligent as to be tantamount to lying,? Napolitano said. ?This happened over and over again.? Navarro offered a handful of examples of theprosecution failure to disclose. One had to do with a video showing government surveillance of the Bundy ranch, as well as government snipers, before the standoff. ?Timing is everything when it comes to these documents,? said Napolitano. ?The tapes show that the defendants were telling the truth when they said they brought a militia to the property to protect them from snipers, rather than thegovernment version, which is that the snipers came to protect the government agents from the militia.? Other instances of the government holding back included the failure to produce an internal affairs report on BLM misconduct, which the defense requested and the government denied existed, and threat assessments by federal agents declaring the Bundys were not likely to use violence. ?The court does regrettably believe a mistrial in this case is the most suitable and only remedy,? Navarro said in declaring a mistrial. Ammon and Ryan Bundy were arrested. LaVoy Finicum was dead. The standoff in Oregon between ranchers and the federal government seemed to be at an end as the leaders of the revolt had either been killed, or were in custody. Four holdouts remained at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in eastern Oregon, though. Negotiations were underway for their surrender. The son of famed preacher Billy Graham, Franklin Graham, said he would meet with the four holdouts at the national refuge, presumably to bring the revolt which has captivated Americans nationwide to a peaceful resolution. Elected officials joined in the fray, telling the holdouts to ?stay alive? so their story could be told. While this was happening, Cliven Bundy announced he would come to Oregon to bolster the holdouts stand against the federal government. As the holdouts somehow managed to break an FBI blockof internet and cell communications, and stream audio, and video of what was happening, Cliven Bundy landed at Portland International Airport, and was immediately surrounded by SWAT teams. USA Today reports that the elderly rancher was arrested, and booked into Multnomah County Jail. Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy has been arrested after flying into Portland International Airport. The father of Ammon Bundy, the leader of the occupation at an Oregon wildlife refuge, was detained by the FBI and booked into Multnomah County Jail on Wednesday night, theprison records show. A post on BundyRanch Facebook page said: ?Cliven Bundy just landed in Portland; we are being told by eyes on ground that he was surrounded by SWAT and DETAINED.? The 74-year-old, who intended to travel to Burns, close to the wildlife refuge, faces federal charges related to a standoff at his ranch in 2014, The Oregonian reported. The newspaper said he faces a charge of conspiracy to interfere with a federal officer and weapons charges. The elderly Bundy was good friends with Arizona rancher LaVoy Finicum, who was killed by authorities during the Oregon standoff. During the standoff, Finicum told reporters that he just wanted to go home. Finicum was a foster parent to 4, and hosted 50 foster children at his ranch in Arizona. Finicum explained in a video why he disliked the federal government so much. The Bureau of Land Management stole his water. The ?Oregon Standoff? began because Amanda Marshall, an Obama appointee for U.S. attorney for Oregon, recommended that the government sentence Oregon rancher Dwight Hammond and his son, Steven Hammond as terrorists for a controlled burn on their land which reached federal land.

"Story highlights Recent cyber hacks have targeted state election boards and the DNC Clinton issued an implicit threat to Russia that the US could hit back hard on cyber (CNN) Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump disputed Monday that Russia may be behind a series of cyberattacks on election systems in the US and on the Democratic National Committee -- a conclusion that US officials and lawmakers have come to. The New York real estate mogul questioned Russian culpability in response to comments by Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton at the first presidential debate pointing the finger at Russia for recent breaches.

He continued, ""It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds."" But Clinton said there was ""no doubt"" that Russia has been responsible, an assessment top US security authorities and members of congressional intelligence committees support.

"History Teacher Stomps on the American Flag in the Classroom There is no law against burning the American flag. There is no law against stomping upon it either. However, thatdoesn mean that parents should have to accept a teacher teaching their kids to hate America. Hatred for America and her history and values is all the rage these days amongst the left. Believing it to be chic and edgy, many liberals are apt to stomp upon the flag that greater Americans than they fought and died to defend. One history teacher at a public school stomped on the American flag to prove some kind of point and now, unsurprisingly, people are upset. A teacher on Monday at Massey Hill Classical High School in Fayetteville, North Carolina ? home of Fort Bragg andAmerica Special Forces ? stomped on the flag to prove a point about the value of the First Amendment. The school district claims that they are investigating the incident. However, with teachers being fiercely guarded by union extortionists,it doubtful that this man will see any repercussions unless he dares to mention Christ. ? 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

"Story highlights $28 million is set to be spent this week Groups tied to Andy Beal and Ben Carson are responsible for part of the spending Washington (CNN) Spending by super PACs tied to Donald Trump friends such as Ben Carson and banker Andy Beal will help make this week the general election's most expensive yet. Republicans and Democrats will spend almost $28 million on radio and television this week, according to advertising records, as Trump substantially increases his advertising buy for the final stretch. He's spending $6.4 million in nine states, part of what aides have said will be a $100 million television campaign through Election Day. Trump on Tuesday began reserving time on broadcast and cable through November 8. And he's getting help on other mediums, too. Beal, a Dallas billionaire who doubles as a semi-professional poker player, has started his own super PAC that has spent $1 million on pro-Trump newspaper and digital advertisements. With a net worth estimated to be $9 billion, Beal is effectively spurning the other Trump super PACs who had courted him relentlessly. It is unlikely that Beal's group, Save America from Its Government, will do television. But Jacob Cherner, a Beal aide, said he could not put a limit on how much Beal would spend.

" Democratic President Barack Obama pulled off a historic diplomatic coup when he engineered an accord with Iran to freeze their nuclear program for ten years in exchange for lifting the sanctions that had been strangling their economy. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton engineered the tough economic sanctions that dragged Iran to the negotiating table after ex-Vice President Dick Cheney rebuffed their efforts at negotiation, convincing countries like China and Russia to act in unison with the United States and against their own short term business interests. It was a major diplomatic accomplishment and made our world safer. Did Trump just say US gave Iran $150 billion? Did I really hear that? ? Arash Karami (@thekarami) September 27, 2016 Republican nominee Donald Trump keeps spewing complete fabrications about the Iran accords which President Obama concluded at the start of this year. He started by repeating the lie Fox News planted about America paying $400 million dollars ofIran own cash back to them, at the conclusion of the agreements. It was money America owed Iran under a legal agreement. The State Department returned $400 million to the Iranian government, but it was money that we owed them. Wedidn givethem anything. In the 1970s, the United States made a deal to sell $400 million of fighter jets to the Shah of Iran. The Shah paid upfront but was then deposed in the Iranian revolution, so the United States never delivered the jets. As part of the nuclear disarmament deal, the Iranian government simple wanted their money back if weweren going to cough up the jets. InTrump mind, that money inflated to $150 billion. Cash to paid to Iran as part of the lifting of sanctions rises from $400million to $1.5 billion to $150 billion according to Trump. #debates ? Albert Rapacioli (@speedlinefoto) September 27, 2016 Bingo! Trump's Iran cash lie. Much debunked. ? Sarah Reese Jones (@PoliticusSarah) September 27, 2016 Not only has the Republican nominee devoted most of his false statements about Iran to lying, he thinksit a great idea to start a needless war, with a country whose help we need to settle the disastrous Syrian Civil War.That when Hillary Clinton blew Trump out of the water for his empty threats about Iran which either look horrifically weak, or are calculated to start a war which would cost Americans dearly in blood and treasure, all to satisfy the outsize ego of a Republican that no sane voter should choose in November. #Debates2016 Clinton- Trump said he'd blow Iran boaters out of water & start another war.

"2016Obama teamisn laughing at Trump anymore Thepresident aides worry the Republican represents more of America than a fringe. Obamaworld laughed as it watched DonaldTrump hostile takeover of the GOP. After eight years of Republican opposition, inconsistent policy demands and racialized hate against the first black president, President BarackObama aides, past and present, thought Republicans had gotten what they deserved--and more, all but forfeiting the 2016 race to the woman they defeated eight years ago.They not laughing anymore. Story Continued Below Going into Mondaynight debate,Obama team is feeling that same anxiety expressed by some top Hillary Clinton aides: maybe the countryisn what they thought, maybe the resistance to Obamacare and gay marriage and the progressthey so proud of is broader than the vocal fringethey always dismissed. Maybe, thepresident aides ? current and former ? now concede,they going to have to live with the fact that Trump could end up in the Oval Office in part due to a backlash against Obama. ?I?m trying to think of a series to compare it to, which was a series that started as a comedy and became a high stakes drama,? said Ben LaBolt, a former White House aide and press secretary forObama 2012 reelection campaign. ?I feel likewe maybe in the fifth season of ?Breaking Bad? here.We way beyond the laughs, and just sitting on the edge of our seats in terror.? ?There's not a lot of mirth in the circles I run in about him,? said another former senior Obama campaign staffer. Privately, Obama has expressed mixed feelings, according to people close to the president.He still nursing amusement at Republicans for being hapless enough to get railroaded by Trump, butit mixed with frustration that there are so many Americans he failed to reach. People who've spoken to him say the president wonders what he might have done differently to break through in a way that would make peoplewho benefited from hispolicies those enjoying added health benefits courtesy ofObamacare Democrats. For Obamaworld staffers who had just been starting to settle into a new buoyancy about the president's climbing approval numbers,Trump growing strength is an agonizing reminder of how far short they have fallen in delivering on ?hope.' Even if Clinton wins, the Republican has shown not only that America is divided between red and blue but thatthere an America that Obama never connected with at all, and where all his data and rational arguments and appeals to sensibilities are as useless as Monopoly money. ?We are still the country that elected Barack Obama in 2008, and we are capable of that and more,? said Jim Papa, a former special assistant for legislative affairs in the White House. ?Butwe also capable of making bad choices and being seduced by someone who plays to fears and anxieties and racial differences.?Trump already done things they never thought he could, like mainstreaming racist rhetoric and racking up so many small donors that they worry about the extent of his support. And that was even before he riled up Obama doubters again with his birther pirouette. And the result:Trump doing better in the polls at this late stage thanObama team imagined. With 43 days to go, Trump and Clinton are essentially tied, polls sitting within the margin of error, even in battleground states. Though only a few weeks ago, current and former Obama aides would joke about how thepresident great political legacy might be the Republican Party destroying itself in front of him. Now, on the record, they push back on the very suggestion thatObama legacy should be viewed in any frame that Trump also occupies. ?Idon think he thinksit his legacy, Idon think any of us thinkit his legacy,? said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to the president. ?Trumpism is a lot of things in this country. President Obama is the face of that for some Republicans, but the Republican Party got themselves into this mess.? But they worry about what even a Trump loss says aboutObama America. ?I think he will lose badly in this election, but I think the impacthe had on our political process is incredibly damaging, and will be lasting,? said Tommy Vietor, a former national security spokesman who noted that his own amusement at Trump ended a year ago. ?He?s made us look stupid. I think he is stupid.? For any efforts Obama made in urging people to disagree without being disagreeable, as the president likes to say, ?Trump has shattered that,? Vietor said. ?He has brought back a brand of politics that is you punch your opponent as hard as you can, itdoesn matter ifit a low blow, itdoesn matter ifit not of substance.That a bad lesson for people to learn.? According to Earnest, Obama is serious about wanting a functional opposition and wishes thathe had one to negotiate with on immigration reform, trade, infrastructure and other priorities. The sense of lost opportunity eats at them, as does the sense thatit not going away, despite their confidence inClinton chances. ?I?m not sayingwe all be playing acoustic guitar in a circle on the National Mall, but I am saying we would have progress to show for our efforts,? said White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who's been with the president since the first campaign. Noteveryone inside Obamaworld is down. Some schadenfreude remains. ?He's still exposed and ripped apart factions of the GOP, enhanced their brand as hostile to a rising electorates, and will leave them with no infrastructure,? said a more upbeat former Obama 2008 campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan. And Democrats? sense of the vacuous GOP that Trump represents continues to resonate, particularly as they see the Republican nominee attack an economythat gone wrong with the support of many of the same people who opposed the policies that the president credits for the economic rebound that includes the longest period of sustained growth and taxpayers repaid with interest from the bailouts that caused so much trouble. ?The eight-year legacy of the recovery from the Great Recession is clear evidence that the Tea Party movement,? said Earnest, ?is intellectuallybankrupt about something other than the economy.? But that doesn't take care of their grief about the state of American politics. ?I?d rather live in a world where the two parties really compete,? Papa said, ?than have a political edge on the Republican Party but have to live in a world where white supremacists have a channel and are legitimized.?",0.03638814,0.0053908359999999995,0.0053908359999999995,0.016172507,0.060646900000000004,0.323450135,0.0040431270000000005,2,-1,1

"It?s really starting to look like former President Barack Hussein Obama and his partner in crime Secretary of State Crooked Hillary Clinton had a real big soft spot for Iran and its funding of terrorism around the world. According to the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida, three years ago the Obama Administration actually went as far as to warn the Iranian government that Israel was about to assassinate General Qassem Soleimani. Soleimani is the commander of the Quds Force, which is a branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards that manages foreign military operations. Otherwise known as terrorism to the peace-loving world. Although the allegations of this treasonous action by the Barack Obama himself is still uncorroborated it is said to have caused the collapse of the whole Israeli operation. The Washinton Examiner Reports: Why is Iranian master terrorist Qassem Soleimani distributing photos of himself in Iraq? DUBAI, United Arab Emirates ? CIA Director Mike Pompeo confirmed that Iranian Qods Force commander Qassem Soleimani was in Kirkuk against the backdrop of Iraqi moves to restoreBaghdad authority over the city and surrounding disputed areas. Many analysts in Washington take that as a sign that Iraq and largely Shiite militias ? the so-called Hashd al-Shaabi ? were operating under the orders and guidance of Iran. This may be overstated for two reasons. First, Soleimani acts not only as an operative but also asIran most trusted diplomat and, second, Soleimani was coordinating with the Kurds and so the narrative of pro-American Kurds versus pro-Iranian Iraqis simplydoesn make sense. True,Iran influence in Iraq is serious and presents a challenge both to U.S. and Iraqi interests, but exaggeratingSoleimani role based on photos he tweets out may actually play intoSoleimani strategy. At first glance, it seems strange that Soleimani, given his position asIran chief operative in the covert world of terrorism and special operations, would allow his photo to be taken. That he does so, however, is the rule rather than the exception. In 2015, Iran released a Soleimani documentary, proudly announced on his now-defunct website.Soleimani penchant for photos in the field has become so pronounced that many analysts ? especially in Gulf Cooperation Council countries ? suspect he might be laying the groundwork for a presidential run. ButSoleimani photos also have another purpose: to suggest thatIran role is more pervasive and effective than it actually may be.It an influence operation, plain and simple, and one in which Iran often engages. In Beirut, Baghdad, and Basra,I found donation boxes belonging to the Imam Khomeini Relief Committee, a charity funded byIran supreme leader and designated by the U.S. Treasury Department for activities that are decidedly uncharitable. When I have called out Lebanese and Iraqi officials on how they can deny Iranian influence when the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-linked charity manages to drill boxes into public streets in the center of major cities, the response is always the same: The Iranians do so without permits or permission, but countering the move is simply not a fight either Lebanon or Iraq are willing or able to pick. That, of course, is an acknowledgement of Iranian power. But what isIran point? After all, in all my years traversing the Middle East,I never seen anyone put money in those collection boxes, nor has anyoneI met. Frankly, after billions of dollars in sanctions relief and ransom payments provided to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in the last years of the Obama presidency, they do not lack money. The answer is simply that Iranian officials want to project an image of all-pervasive presence and influence.It not just Soleimani or the Imam Khomeini Relief Committee. Consider this 2015 photo, supposedly from the Ashura Brigade Situation Room from which the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps supposedly controlled unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, in support of efforts to defeat the Islamic State. Of course, when the Iraqi military and Hashd al-Shaabi subsequently liberated Fallujah and Ramadi, there was no mention of Iranian UAVs. They played no effective role. But ask many Iraqis, and it was the Iranians who best supported Iraqi forces, both on the ground and by air. Indeed, the majority of Iraqis believe the U.S. supported ISIS and it was Iran who defended Iraq from them. The reason for such a conspiracy is multifold. In the wake of theISIS rise, Iran provided Iraq with weapons and aircraft within a couple days but, in order to display its displeasure with then-Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, the Obama administration delayed meaningful U.S. support for weeks if not months. In effect, it was like afriend house caught fire. One neighbor turned on his hose and helped dump buckets of water on the blaze, while the other stayed at home and watched ?Keeping Up With the Kardashians.? Of course, the Obama administration subsequently did help, but air support does not provide the same photo-ops that ground operations do. And even after U.S. Special Forces eventually returned to help on the ground, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and various Iranian outlets countered this simply by repeating the mantra that the U.S. sponsored ISIS. That may have been nonsense ? after all, the Iranian-backed Bashar Assad regime in Syria did not once bomb the ISIS capital at Raqqa in its years of monopolizing Syrian airspace ? but lies absent an effective response become conventional wisdom, especially when most Iraqis and Iranians (rightly) believe NATO member Turkey was culpable inISIS rise. So, back to the photos of Soleimani in Kirkuk: They are real andthat a problem. But, buying into the image ofSoleimani all-pervasive presence and influence in Iraq may actually be fulfilling the goals of Soleimani himself. Just because Soleimani takes a photo does not mean he is in direct control; it only means that he wants people to believe he is in direct control. Thatdoesn mean the U.S.shouldn try to counter Soleimani. Snatching him when, in contravention to U.N. sanctions, he is outside Iran would be a good place to start even considering the blowback which would surely follow. But getting dragged into an intra-Kurdish squabble or allowing Kurds to cynically and hypocritically play the Iran card against Iraq is simply counterproductive. ?I would simply ask him what he wants from us,? said a senior US military official. In addition to the soldiers killed this year, the US ambassador in Baghdad, James Jeffrey, said last summer that Iranian proxies accounted for roughly a quarter of US combat casualties in Iraq ? around 1,100 deaths and many thousands more injuries. Despite this, the US has landed few public blows onSuleimani close circle. In March 2007, the British SAS captured a senior Hezbollah official, Ali Moussa Daqduq, who had allegedly planned an operation that killed seven soldiers in Karbala. The same year, US troops also captured two men in the Kurdish north who they believed were al-Quds leaders. Apart from that, the trophy cabinet remains bare ? at least publicly. More troubling than the apparent dearth of tactical victories is how the rest of the year will play out. The US ? and some key neighbouring Sunni states ? believeIran strategy in Iraq as the conflict winds down is to keep the country in a permanent but manageable state of chaos. ?They keep it on simmer and turn it up and down when they want to,? said one Lebanese official in Beirut. The senior US military spokesman in Iraq, Major General Jeffrey Buchanan agreed. ?Their overall strategy has been to keep [Iraq] isolated from the rest of its neighbours and from the US, because that makes it likely that it will depend on Iran. They want Iraq to play a subordinate, weak role.? OnlyIraq lawmakers can stop the master-client relationship from becoming entrenched here.It a task that Kurdish legislator in the national parliament, Mahmoud Othman, fears may prove to be beyond his colleagues. ?Qassem Suleimani is the key man to every decision taken in Iraq,? he said. ?It is a shame to have such a man playing such a role in this country. There should be a relationship between equals like normal relations with normal states.? If these charges are indeed true then Barry Soetoro could even be tried in a court of law. He betrayed an unwavering ally in order to placate his own people in Iran. This is why you never elect a man who has an Islamic name to the office of President of The United States of America. Let this serve as a lesson to those who voted for him out of white guilt. When Obama decided it was a good idea to side with the terrorists instead of our allies it fast became obvious who he really was, an enemy to the western world. He is not a real American and his loyalties never lied with the real Americans. He was always on the wrong side of the argument, and on the wrong side of history. His presidency will always be a sore spot in American History, and rightly so. We as a nation have had to suffer bad presidencies before, but never had we had to suffer a president who clearly sided with the enemies over our own peace-loving allies.

"Donald Trump was criticized by Hillary Clinton over his involvement in the birther movement and for his buisness practices during Monday's debate. | Getty Simon Says Trump needed to be an 11. He was barely a 4 Donald Trump knows how to work a Republican room. Give him that. Give him a gym packed full of yahoos wearing backward baseball caps andhe bring down the rafters. Story Continued Below But give him a debate crowd where they let Democrats and independents in, well, hedoesn play so well. Some candidates give energy to the crowds and some get energy from the crowds. Trump is more of a getter. He needs the crowds. And when the people are not yelling and shouting and stamping their feet for him, he just seems to dry up. Give him a crowd where the audience actually wants to hear what the two candidates for president have to say and Trump is at a disadvantage. He is used to audiences that are already primed and ready. They shout the lines to him. They shout, ?Wall!? and he goes into his bit about building a wall on the Mexican border. They yell, ?Benghazi!? and he goes into his bit about how Hillary Clinton was asleep at the switch. But itwasn Hillary who was asleep Monday night at the first presidential debate at Hofstra University in New York. It was Trump. He turned out to be a snooze. He needed to be an 11 and he turned in a performance that ranked about a 4. Nothing he said seemed to work. ""It's terrible what's been going on in Chicago,? he said. ?I have property there."" Nothing like keeping your priorities straight, I guess. He was so off his game that hedidn even remember to bring up the wall or Benghazi. Maybe it was his health. Trump had not been on stage for two minutes before Twitter lit up with mentions of his sniffing into the microphone. Which he did on and on. And was interrupted only by his sipping of water. And rubbing his nose with his index finger. A nonsensical issueto bring up when talking about the presidency? If so, why did the Trump campaign make such a big thing out ofHillary recent ? and fleeting ? bout of pneumonia? Who knows what Trump really has? If, like a lot of germophobes (he hates to shake hands, but campaigning has forced him to do so) he is also a hypochondriac, then his life must be a psychological hell right now. He knew this first debate was going to be tough. Before it started I heard a TV reporter say, ?Arguably, this is the biggest night in modern American political history.? (One tip: Whenever you hear a reporter say something is ?arguably,? the answer is always, ?No,it not.?) But it was sure to be important. And Trump could have used a strategy thatwouldn have cost him the millions of dollars he has been shelling out to the dopes around him. He could have studied up. He could have practiced. Just a little. And the need for practice is hardly a secret. These 90-minute slugfests are difficult.It difficult just to stand up for 90 minutes, let alone stand up for 90 minutes and talk and make sense. Hillary knew that. She is married to the best debater I have ever seen. And Bill Clinton practiced so hard for his presidential debates that he drove his staff batty. While most campaigns do mock debates to prepare, they rarely do full 90-minute mock debates every day.It just too draining. But Bill would insist on full mock debates and then make everybody sit down and watch the debates on tape and evaluate every word he said and every gesture he made. So Hillary did not just prepare for Monday night, her staff told reporters she was ?overpreparing.? And so how did she spend the morning of the debate? By holding a mock-debate. During the real debate, she hit virtually all her talking points. Shedidn hold back. Trump, she said, had started his presidential career with racist lies over birtherism and ?he has a long record of racist behavior.? There was only one argument, in fact, that I thought she blew. ?I have met a lot of people who have been stiffed by you,? Hillary said. ?Are they not owed an apology?? Actually, they are owed more than an apology. They are owed money.

The paper lambasted Donald Trump, by contrast, as a ""thin-skinned demagogue who is unqualified and unsuited to be president.""

But it also wrestles with the former secretary of state's perceived shortcomings, noting her ""penchant for secrecy"" and dinging her ""for adjusting her positions to match popular opinion and for being a little too comfortable with the use of military force."" Ultimately, the board concludes: ""To be a great president, she will have to struggle to overcome her own weaknesses. But compared withTrump infirmities as a candidate, her failings are insignificant.It absurd ? and perilous ? to portray this election, as so many are doing, as a choice of the 'lesser of two evils' or to suggest that her flaws are in any way on a level with his.""

He probably alsodidn expect the photographer to be who he is: A refugee living in the U.K. David Kittos fled Turkish occupation of Cyprus in the 1970s and has been living in the U.K. ever since. He is (quite understandably) angry by Trump Jr.?s misappropriation of his image to promote a xenophobic, racist and anti-refugee policy: ?This was not done with my permission, Idon support his politics and I would never take his money to use it. In 1974, when I was six-years old, I was a refugee from the Turkish occupation of Cyprus so I would never approve the use of this image against refugees.? Oops.That only a minor faux pas ? oh wait.It a major embarrassment to use an image that originates with a refugee to speak out against refugees. Kittos took the picture six years ago in his studio while he was experimenting with a specific type of flash.He not on Twitter, but friends familiar with his work let him know of this unauthorized and offensive use of one of his photos, which does appear on Flickr. Just what is up with this campaign acting like copyright only applies to other people? We digress. Anyway. Kittos? photo was never intended for political use and he certainly would never release it or sell it for such usage. Trump Jr. and others, like the disgraceful former Congresscritter Joe Walsh,don seem to care, though, as long as they can make their point that refugees are dangerous.

However, he did say: ?I would like the Trump campaign to delete the image, but they are probably not interested in what I have to say. I was thinking about getting lawyers involved but Idon know if I have the patience. Thisisn about the money for me. They could have just bought a cheap image from a micro stock library.

Not voting is not an option; it just plays intoTrump hands.? Story Continued Below Embracing her inner policy wonk, Clinton asked young voters to give her candidacy a chance. ?I spend a lot of time on the details of policy, like the precise interest rate on your student loan ? right down to the decimal,? she said during a rally at Temple University in Philadelphia. Even with a less crowded field and facing an opponent like Trump, Clinton and her team admitted she has a problem reaching this peg of the so-called Obama coalition, the wide range of demographic groups that powered thenation first African-American president to the White House. ?The millennial generation is a key voting bloc in this election, and it is clear that the campaign must do more to earn their vote,?Clinton communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, said in a statement earlier on Monday. While Clinton struggled mightily among younger voters in her primary contest against Bernie Sanders, operatives on both sides of the aisle expected her to have an easier time against Trump ? largely because of Democrats? traditional advantage over Republicans among the younger set. But a spate of recent polls have shown thatClinton share of young voters is smaller than many expected, largely because of the relatively high support flowing to Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, each of whom has emerged as an option for young voters disillusioned by the two-party system and its candidates. Increasingly nervous that her lead is slipping away partly because of her weak standing with young voters,Clinton team has been ratcheting up its millennial outreach effort in recent weeks beyondMonday speech ? her first address explicitly dedicated to reaching those voters. Her campus organizing teams ? partly led by a former Sanders staffer ? have been increasing their efforts as students return to college, and her policy team put out an online ?college calculator? service that helps students plan out their education costs and demonstrates savings underClinton college plan.

"Eighteen months ago, three junior senators attempted something their chamber had never considered, much lessaccomplished to roll back the long-entrenched federal ban on marijuana. Though all first-termers, thesenators Gillibrand of New York, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rand Paul ofKentucky enough about the difficulties of marijuana politics to avoid any mention of full-scale legalization. They tailored the bill to focus narrowly on medical marijuana and the half-dozen stumbling blocks in federal law that have made it so difficult for Americans to get safe access to the increasingly popular drug. Story Continued Below They branded their bill with a clever acronym: the CARERS Act, for the Compassionate Access, Research Expansion and Respect States Act of 2015, which, if passed, would do a number of sensible things: reclassify marijuana so that it is considered to have some medical value; permit banks to handle money from legal marijuana businesses; prevent the government from interfering with state-legal medical marijuana programs; exclude non-psychoactive marijuana extracts from the definition of marijuana; grant military veterans access to medical marijuana; and break thegovernment monopoly on medical marijuana research. To noone surprise, the bill went absolutely nowhere. But itdidn die. Despite being ignored by leadership, it managed to collect 16 cosponsors by the end of 2015, a laundry list of mostly Democrats, two Republicans and an independent. Then, early this year, a 17th name was added, and a surprising one at that: Lindsey Graham. The senior senator from South Carolina, an establishment Republican if ever there was one, a foreign policy hawk who ran for president this cycle in large part because he perceived RandPaul isolationism as a threat to national security, LindseyGraham represents a state thatdoesn even allow medicalmarijuana become one of the unlikeliest and potentially most influential of thebill backers because he is unique among the bill's cosponsors (now at 20), ashe the only one with a gavel. And unlike his colleagues among Republican leadership, Graham is using his authority to move the marijuana bill forward. In mid-July, he chaired a Judiciary subcommittee hearing focused on the pros and cons of changing the way the Drug Enforcement Administration classifies marijuana like it was heroin. Over the 4? decades of the war on drugs, there have been plenty of hearings on the dangers of marijuana, but before July 13 there had never been a hearing on marijuana's medical benefits. ?If there was one, I don't know about it,? Graham told POLITICO Magazine. The emergence of Graham as an honest broker of information on this issue reflects rapidly shifting attitudes among conservative Americans. Opposition to marijuana legalization among Republicans has withered from 60 percent in December 2014 to 42 percent in July 2016, while the percentage of Republicans in favor of legalizing pot has grown from 28 percent to 45 percent over the same period. But Graham does more than just add a prominent voice. His decision to chair a hearing was a critical step (though no guarantee) toward getting a vote on the CARERS Act in the full Judiciary Committee, the only avenue by which it can reach the Senate floor. Graham, he is at pains to point out, rejects marijuana for recreational use, but he told POLITICO Magazine, ?I am open-minded to the idea that the plant may have medical attributes that could help people.?I'm convinced that we should, as a nation, research the medical applications of the marijuana plant....It could be life-changing. I just want to do it in a scientificway the current system doesn't allow for the research that we need.? ***We seen this before, when public opinion swings suddenly on a divisive cultural issue and yanks lawmakers along by the arm. It happened with gay marriage, and the impetus of the change is always personal experience.Graham conversion has been no different. ?I have several people that I personally know who have children who have some epilepsy and other diseases,? Graham told POLITICO, ?and the parents seem to think this helps.And stuns me is how little we know and how much more we could know. Some of these [diseases], like epilepsy, the families tell us that it has changed the child's life.That why I want more research. Is that anecdotal, or is it real? To me, that's very exciting.? Parents of children with epilepsy have become the most effective advocates for marijuana law reform at every level. Consequently, in a very short time frame, laws legalizing cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound found in the cannabis plant, have passed in 16 states, mostly in the south and southeast: Texas, Alabama, Mississippi and, yes, South Carolina. The problem is that most of these laws provide little access to actual CBD because marijuana is still classified as a highly addictive drug with no medical benefit. So the state laws, in some cases, have made matters worse by providing false hope for the parents of sick children, a problem the CARERS Act aims to solve. ?When you ask if it is still illegal under federal law,it almost a trick question,? said Jill Swing, a South Carolina resident and mother of a child affected by a disease that is treatable with CBD. ?Currently the federal government is in conflict with itself. The Federal Farming Act of 2014 allows for cultivation of hemp?.That being said, all forms of cannabis, including hemp, are considered Schedule I controlled substances by the DEA. That is why the CBD component of the CARERS Act is so important.?It parents like Swing who helped educate Graham on the importance of CBD, and legalizing CBD has become sort of an entry-level course for former drug warriors who are now inching toward drug policy reform. Even Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and longtimeb noire of marijuana advocates, made an appearance atGraham subcommittee hearing in July to express his support for legalizing CBD. But he made sure to limit his support to juvenile epileptics and ?children who suffer from these rare conditions.? In essence, he was acknowledging the medical benefit of marijuana but reserving the right to determine which sick people deserve access to that medicine.Graham open-mindedness on the issue goes back to an experience with his own mother, whose death he wrote about in an autobiography he released in the run-up to his presidential campaign. In My Story, a 126-page e-book available on his website, Graham relates in gripping detail his motherMillie battle with stage IVHodgkin lymphoma, her quick wasting, how the doctors pronounced her dead, and how Lindsey rushed to her bedside and revived her, if only for a few days. His mother, 56, told him, ""Lindsey, let me go.? After a week, during which the 21-year-old college student witnessed his mother convulse with seizures, Graham, fighting back tears, told his mother: ?Okay, let go.We be fine. Let go.? ?She smiled at me,? Graham wrote, ?and died five minutes later.? The book never delves into whether marijuana might have helped his mother (she died in 1976, decades before the debate would emerge so publicly), but the anecdote is just the kind of experience that could cause even a lobbyist-besieged senator to empathize with cancer survivors evangelizing the benefits of medical marijuana. So, I asked Graham ifthat what happened with him. ?Absolutely,? he said, without hesitation. ?I mean,chemotherapy kill you to make you better. And people who go through chemo treatment go through hell. If there's an application of the marijuana plant that can help patients like that? I know they need all the help they can get. I just want to make sure we do it based on science, but that is a worthy goal....Sign me up.? *** ButGraham voteshaven always matched his thinking on the issue. It took some gentle nudging from Don Murphy, director of conservative outreach for the Marijuana Policy Project, to getGraham votes to reflect his rhetoric. It was the morning of June 11, 2015, when Murphy said he caught Graham in the hallway before Graham went into a meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee to vote. Graham asked Murphy, ?How you doing?? And Murphy seized the opening. ?Well, that depends on how you vote on my amendment.? ?Well, what amendment is that?? ?It?s the medical marijuana amendment,? Murphy recalls telling Graham, ?andI read thatyou made certain positive statements about the states making these decisions and patients making these decisions, and I hope your vote reflects your previous statements.? Indeed, in February 2014, Graham had told WBTV in Charlotte, North Carolina: ??when it comes to medicinal marijuana and this [CBD] oil, I think politicians should embrace what makes sense?.This is about families with sick children.? In effect, Graham was making favorable statements for more than a year before Murphy grabbed him in the hallway. He justwasn voting that way. Murphy reminded him of this, he said, eliciting polite nods from Graham as the senator clutched the doorknob of the committee room before disappearing inside.Murphy amendment, sponsored by Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), aimed at restricting federal law enforcement from meddling with state-legal medical marijuana programs. It passed the Senate Appropriations Committee that day by a vote of 21-9, with eight Republicans in favor. At the end of the meeting, Murphy was ecstatic, shaking hands and thanking members, but then he was disappointed to see that Graham had voted no by proxy. Later that day, while roaming the halls on the second floor of the Russell Office Building, Murphy said he just happened to bump into Graham and a staffer as they left his office. Graham was holding a laundered shirt on a hanger, which impressed Murphy because Grahamhadn delegated that chore to his staffer. ?How you doing?? Graham asked Murphy, recognizing him from earlier. ?Well,I be doing better if, you know, I thoughtI get your vote.? ?What do you mean?? Graham said. ?You voted no by proxy."" Graham looked at his staffer and said, ?I did?? And the staffer said, ?Yeah, you did.? In long committee meetings, it's not uncommon for a member to step out for a few minutes and for a staffer seated behind the member to indicate with a head nod to the chair how the member intended to vote for a particular amendment. In this case, Graham's staffer guessed incorrectly. ?What!?? Graham said. ?Ididn want to do that!? And right there, Graham pulled out his flip phone and called the clerk to change his vote, but it was too late. From that moment on, Graham was thinking about the issue in a new way. About six months later, Murphy was in New Hampshire lobbying presidential candidates for the Marijuana Policy Project and he bumped into Graham at a Jeb Bush rally, just a few weeks after Graham had suspended his own campaign. Graham came up to Murphy and told him, ?I?m on that bill!??meaning the CARERS Act, which caught Murphy off-guard becauseit his job to know these things. He went back to his hotel that night and looked it up on his laptop anddidn seeGraham name listed as a co-sponsor, so the next day he hunted Graham down and found him at another Jeb rally. ?Senator, respectfully, Idon see your name on there,? Murphy said. ?It?s on there! I promise you,it on there!? Graham insisted. For whatever bureaucratic reason,Graham namewasn officially added to the co-sponsor list until March 10, a month after the New Hampshire primary. *** On July 13, 6? months after Graham withdrew from the presidential race and six months after he saw Don Murphy in New Hampshire, Graham chaired theSenate first-ever hearing on medical marijuana. Murphy was sitting in the gallery. About an hour into the hearing, Graham shuffled through his papers, found what he was looking for, and holding it up, he said, ?Idon mean to advertise for this guy, but Dr. Reefer??displaying a photo of a pot leaf-emblazoned billboard for a Las Vegas-area business that provides medical marijuana cards to qualifying residents. ?He has a billboard. I think this is in Las Vegas,"" Graham said, eliciting enough laughs from the gallery to wake the room up. Graham entered Dr. Reefer into the record to demonstrate that some states? medical marijuana programs ?have not gone down the scientific route,? and he called Dr. Reefer a prime example of a bad actor using medical marijuana as a fig leaf to cover, inGraham words, ?de facto backdoor legalization? of marijuana for recreational use. For Graham, the medical marijuana issue is a spectrum: On one end are the juvenile epileptics who need CBD, who he supports without reservation, and on the other end is Dr. Reefer, an operation that Graham sees as making a mockery of medical marijuana in order to legitimize criminal activity. During his hearing, practically in real time, it appeared Graham was trying to determine where along that spectrum he felt comfortable landing. Graham was introduced to the problem of Dr. Reefer by Miriam Adelson, a medical doctor and an addiction researcher who is also the wife of billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. ?They said, 'This is not what you want,?? Graham tells POLITICO Magazine. ?And I got a bunch of stuff from California, too. But the Dr. Reefer was just too easy, so I chose him.? A lawmaker looking for clarity on this issueisn likely to get much help from the Adelsons, who have taken seemingly contradictory positions on medical marijuana. The Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G. Adelson Medical Research Foundation studies medical marijuana in its facility in Tel Aviv, but just two years ago, in 2014, Sheldon Adelson, one of the most prolific donors to conservative causes, gave the anti-medical marijuana campaign in Florida $5.5 million. The Las Vegas Review Journal flipped its editorial position on marijuana from pro to con after Adelson purchased the newspaper. In September, the Adelsons reinforced their commitment to fight medical marijuana with an additional $1 million to fight legalization in Florida. ?The Adelsons are strong opponents of medical marijuana,? says Michael Collins of the Drug Policy Alliance. Miriam Adelson has not responded to a request for comment from POLITICO Magazine. Craig Moon, publisher of the Review Journal , replied in an email, ?the editorial board reports to me, I believe that Nevadans should vote no on the recreational marijuana amendment. The Adelson family also shares my view.? Dr. Reefer is not a real person;it a business thatdoesn grow or sell any marijuana. Since it opened in 2001, it charges patients a fee and provides them with a medical card that allows them to purchase marijuana legally at separate establishments. It was founded by a three-time felon who ran afoul of federal authorities in 2010, when he was caught overstepping the bounds of Dr.Reefer business model by selling marijuana directly to clients. Dr. Reefer continues its busy referral business with its provocative brand name under new ownership (whose identities are difficult to determine). ?As for the billboards,it nothing new,? says Derek Sante, spokesman for Dr. Reefer. ?Those billboards have been up for more than a decade.? Although advocates like Don Murphy have no love for the Adelsons (?It?s heartless to support making criminals out of cancer patients, and that's what Adelsons' position does?), Murphy concedes that operations like Dr. Reefer remain an obstacle to his work. ?Look,he not wrong,? Murphy said, referring to Graham. ?The nonsense that went on in California for years has made it very difficult for those of us who are advocating for legitimate medical marijuana patients.? But Murphy goes on to connect the dots between bad state law and a paralyzed Congress: ?California happens because legislatorsdon do their jobs.? ?So, anyway,? Murphy said, bringing it back around to the CARERS Act hearing in July. ?I?m real happy with Lindsey Graham.? Like many activists who sat throughGraham historic Senate hearing, Murphy left that day feeling like Graham meant business. ?I do mean business,? Graham told POLITICO Magazine. ?Sen. Graham has gone above and beyond,? says Murphy. ?He justdidn put his name on it [the CARERS Act], he actually held a hearing. And I give him major props for that, and the hearing was pretty fair.? ?What we're doing today is not enough,? Graham said of the federal drug-law status quo. ?We need to do more, and I just want to make sure that what we do doesn't get us to legitimizing the Dr. Reefers of the world.? On August 11, the DEA refused to reclassify marijuana from Schedule I to the less-severe Schedule II, as the CARERS bill would do, but did promise to accept applications for licensed growing operations in order to improve access to research-quality marijuana. Itdidn indicate how many applications it would approve. (Graham has not responded to requests for comment regarding theDEA decision.) Unless something changes in the lame-duck session, the likelihood the CARERS Act gets a vote in this Congress remains close to zero; the fight over Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland is all the Senate Judiciary Committee is focused on. While the CARERS Act's progress is historic, it's still just a marijuana bill on Capitol Hill. And the lame-duck session could indeed follow a landslide of state-level marijuana victories that could rattle even the most steadfast drug-war loyalist. Medical marijuana will be on the ballot in Arkansas, Florida, Montana and North Dakota, while full Colorado-style legalization will be on the ballot in California, Arizona, Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada, where voters could render Dr. Reefer and his ""de facto legalization"" scheme beside the point. But Don Murphy of MPP is having a field day with it. He tells all the Republican lawmakers in states where it's on the ballot: ""I bet you marijuana gets more votes than you do.""

"Washington  Boxing promoter Don King thrust himself back into the political scene Wednesday when he dropped the N-word at a Donald Trump minority outreach event. It's the latest step into the political fray for King, who has a long history of colorfully weighing in on politics on both sides of the aisle going back half a century. After serving nearly four years in prison for a manslaughter conviction in 1966 for killing an associate who owed him $600, King was later pardoned of the crime in 1983 by then-Ohio Gov. Jim Rhodes. The governor received letters of recommendation from several luminaries, including former presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, a Democrat, and then-Cleveland mayor (and future Ohio senator) George Voinovich, a Republican. In 1992, King invoked his Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions before a Senate subcommittee investigating ties between boxing and organized crime. Here are a few other political highlights from King's career: 'Republicrat' At the June funeral for Muhammad Ali, with whom King at one point worked, he declared his non-partisan status. ""I'm endorsing the people. I'm not a Republican or a Democrat, I'm a Republicrat, and I go with the will of the people,"" he told the New York Daily News. Hillary Clinton King previously praised Trump's Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, calling her ""dynamic"" at a 2014 fundraiser for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, a major Trump critic. ""I have been a supporter of Secretary Clinton for a long time,"" King said at the event, which benefited the Nevada senator's re-election campaign. ""She is a dynamic woman, and I am a fighter for woman's rights,"" he added. Barack Obama The Cleveland native supported President Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012. At the time, he said white voters struggling to get behind a black candidate need to move past it. King said they should ""ask God to help you pretend that Barack Obama is white,"" he told journalists. ""I understand very well that after more than three centuries of being taught, conditioned and indoctrinated to hate the black man as your inferior, it is unrealistic to think that now you can just change to respect him,"" he wrote. ""Try to think of your beloved country America and what's best for Miss Liberty,"" King added. ""Then try not to think of Barack Obama as a black man but as an American fighting for what's best for your children and your country."" Reince Priebus King, The New York Times reported , was supposed to address this summer's Republican National Convention, but several Republican National Committee officials, including chairman Reince Priebus, nixed the idea, citing the promoter's legal problems. King later said the party chairman removed him because he doesn't ""like black people."" ""I'm not speaking because Reince Priebus is still thinking he don't like black people,"" King told reporters in July. ""I have less than a damn about what Reince Priebus thinks, especially when he's so antiquated."" Black Lives Matter King spoke on the tensions between black residents and law enforcement, saying the ""root"" of the problem gets lost in social media. ""You can't use short-term slogans because people don't understand and they twist them around,"" he said on the floor of the Republican National Convention. ""In our hashtag culture, we treat the effects, not the cause. You've got to get to the cause."" Female voters ""You got to understand what I'm trying to say to you is that the white woman -- and I put it in this kind of (words) so you understand what I'm saying -- the white woman and the slave, the people of color,"" King said Wednesday while campaigning for Trump. ""When the system was created, they did not get heard. The first will be last and the last will be first."" ""The white woman did not have the rights, and she still don't have the rights,"" he added. ""And people of color don't have their rights -- those are the 'left outs.'"" ""Donald Trump says no -- we (are) going back to inclusiveness,"" King added. ""Everybody counts."" On which political party is best for black voters ""Martin Luther King says that both the Republican and the Democrat have a long history of using the black vote as a political football: Promise us everything, give us nothing,"" he told New York Magazine in 2004. George W. Bush ""Oooh! I get a passion. I'm getting excited right now when you said that. George Walker Bush -- he's tough-minded but he's tender-hearted. He's trying to reclaim that glory of that American Dream for all Americans. He put African-Americans in top policy positions higher than any president. He took two people, black, and put them in charge of 300 million people for their security,"" he told New York Magazine. On Bush and terrorism ""George Bush utilizes the big stick. Whatever means necessary. If he wasn't in that White House when we had that despicable attack of terrorism in New York, I shudder to think, I tremble at what would be happening. We would probably have to be doing this interview on the underground, secretly, for fear if we'd go to the street, the treachery that abounds would take alight,"" he said in New York Magazine.",0.034074073999999996,0.0,0.013333333000000001,0.005925926,0.057777777999999995,0.30370370399999996,0.0074074069999999995,2,-1,1
"Story highlights Adelson's decision is a boon for Trump Adelson will likely direct at least $5 million to the Ricketts political operation Washington (CNN) Conservative megadonor Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, have committed roughly $45 million so far to Donald Trump's presidential campaign and downballot Republicans' attempt to control Congress, according to a person familiar with Adelson's thinking. The billionaire on Tuesday will disclose having given $20 million to the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC linked to George W. Bush hand Karl Rove and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. A check of a similar size is expected to go to the Congressional Leadership Fund, a similar super PAC focused on the House of Representatives. And to back Trump, a donation of at least $5 million is likely headed to the political operation helmed by the Ricketts family, who are expected to finally spend their fortunes on Trump as well. Other cash may be routed to Ricketts-led nonprofit groups that are not required to disclose the funders. The spending amounts to a historic investment in the Republican Party ticket's hopes for November, putting millions of dollars behind Trump's bid in a groundbreaking donation that could redefine the final two months of the 2016 campaign.

"Story highlights Ivanka Trump will be attending a roundtable hosted by Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers Trump will hear about the issues GOP House members and Senators are working on in Congress Washington (CNN) Ivanka Trump will join female Republican House members and senators Tuesday in Washington to promote the GOP nominee's proposals on child care, in a continued effort by father's presidential campaign to reach out to women voters. The highest-ranking female House GOP leader, Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, is hosting the roundtable at the Republican National Committee, according to Donald Trump's campaign and a GOP congressional source. McMorris Rodgers worked closely with Trump's daughter on the plans that were officially unveiled last week at an event in suburban Philadelphia. McMorris Rodgers is the only House member to give birth three times while in office. Ivanka Trump is a top adviser and surrogate for her father's campaign and frequently mentions his record of hiring female executives in top positions in his businesses. As a mother of three Trump did several interviews with national outlets about the campaign's new proposals for paid maternity leave and more affordable child care. But she abruptly ended an interview with Cosmopolitan Magazine when the reporter pressed her on previous comments by Donald Trump on pregnant employees, accusing the interviewer of bias. Tuesday's session will cover workplace flexibility, child care, equal pay and the policies the campaign rolled out last week. Trump will also hear from the roughly 15 House members and senators about the issues they are working on in Congress, according to two GOP sources familiar with the plans.

"Sen. Mitch McConnell said a filed spending measure is the ""result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle."" | Getty McConnell plays hardball in spending fight Mitch McConnell is playing hardball ? forcing Democrats into a take-it-or-leave-it position on a must-pass government spending bill before funding runs dry at the end of the month. With spending negotiations still stymied at the Capitol, McConnell filed a new short-term government spending measure Thursday that concedes key priorities to Democrats ? yet stillisn enough to get the minority party on board. Story Continued Below Gone is the so-called ICANN provision, an internet-domain issue that had become a top priority for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and other GOP senators and just got the seal of endorsement from GOP nominee Donald Trump. It also includes some funding for a sweeping opioids bill that was signed into law earlier this year, as well as a landmark chemical safety measure that became law in June. The new spending measure McConnell filed Thursday ? which funds the government until Dec. 9 ? also includes language already worked out between Democrats and Republicans to deal with additional funding for the Zika virus epidemic. A procedural vote on the measure is slated for Tuesday afternoon, and McConnell used a parliamentary maneuver to block amendments to the bill, ensuring that the legislation he outlined was essentially the only option. ?There have been broad requests for a clean continuing resolution. Sothat whatI just offered,? McConnell said. ?It?s the result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle.? But Democrats, who have little incentive to agree quickly to a deal that lets vulnerable Republicans leave Washington, say they object to the legislation because while it includes flood aid for states such as Louisiana, West Virginia and Maryland, itdoesn include money for the long-running water crisis in Flint, Michigan. ?To put Louisiana in without Flint is like waving a red flag. I don't get it,"" said New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the third-ranking Senate Democrat. ""Ihaven counted votes but our caucusisn going to like having Louisiana and not Michigan."" It also does not remove language that prohibits the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring companies to disclose political spending. That is current law, but Democrats have tried to overturn it during the recent negotiations. Democrats also floated a provision related to the Export-Import Bank that would have restored thebank full financing authority, but that was not included in the spending measure McConnell filed Thursday. That Ex-Im provision was also important for some Republicans; South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said he would vote against the short-term funding bill because that language was excluded. ?The president does not believe that a short-term budget measure that only exists because Congresshasn done their job in the first place should be used to pass ideological riders into law,? White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Thursday, while slamming Republicans for their opposition to the Ex-Im Bank. Yet McConnell's proposal is also starting to drive a rift through Democrats. While some leading Senate Democrats stood firm in opposing the new funding measure, other Democrats began to side with Republicans. Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, whose home state of Florida has been the nation's epicenter of the Zika crisis, said he would vote in favor of the new continuing resolution because it sets aside $1.1 billion to combat Zika ""with no political riders."" ""While I support the people of Flint, my priority is the people of Florida,"" Nelson said. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) signaled his displeasure with the bill shortly before McConnell went to the floor to unveil it Thursday afternoon. ?We?re in no hurry to go anyplace, OK? We have all a lot of time,? Reid told reporters. ?I?ve talked with [House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi],she not going to agree to this. The president is not going to agree to this.It really unfair to the American people.? During her weekly news conference earlier Thursday, Pelosi said the legislation, ?in my view, is not even worthy of a counter. It falls very short.? Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the top Democratic appropriator, charged McConnell with filing a ?Republican-only bill"" and said Democrats would not support the legislation, although details of the measure were still emerging and some senators had yet to review it. House Speaker Paul Ryan, for his part, is trying to project an air of calm, telling reporters that lawmakers in his chamber want ""low drama"" in order to solve the government funding impasse. But Cruz is pressuring House lawmakers to fight on behalf of the Internet domain provision that he championed. ""I am grateful for my Senate colleagues' vigorous support during this debate,"" Cruz said in a statement. ""I encourage my colleagues in the House to continue to stand united to ensure that the government funding bill prevents the Obama administration from permanently undermining free speech on the Internet.""

"FBI investigators get inside the family restaurant and adjoined apartment of Ahmad Khan Rahami in Elizabeth, New Jersey, on Sept. 19, 2016. | Getty Police capture man sought in New York-area bombings NEW YORK ? An Afghan immigrant wanted for questioning in the bombings that rocked a New York City neighborhood and a New Jersey shore town was captured Monday after being wounded in a shootout with police that erupted when he was discovered asleep in the doorway of a New Jersey bar, authorities said. WABC-TV footage showed a man believed to be 28-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami being loaded into an ambulance on a stretcher in Linden, New Jersey. He appeared to be conscious and looking around. Story Continued Below Two officers were wounded in the gun battle but were not believed to have been seriously hurt, authorities said. Linden Mayor Derek Armstead said that the owner of a bar reported someone asleep in the doorway of his business. A police officer went to investigate and recognized the man as Rahami, police and the mayor said. Rahami pulled a gun and shot the officer ? who was wearing a bulletproof vest ? in the torso, and more officers joined in a running gun battle down the street and brought Rahami down, police Capt. James Sarnicki said. The arrest came just hours after police issued a bulletin and photo of Rahami, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Afghanistan with an address in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Authorities said the blasts were looking increasingly like an act of terrorism with a foreign connection. Police did not disclose how they zeroed in on Rahami as a person of interest in the bombing investigation but were known to be poring over surveillance video. At the same time, five people who were pulled over in a vehicle Sunday night were being questioned by the FBI, officials said. The shootout came after a weekend of fear and dread in New York and New Jersey. In addition to the blast that injured 29 people in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood on Saturday, an unexploded pressure cooker bomb was found blocks away, and a pipe bomb exploded in a New Jersey shore town before a charity race. No one was injured there. On Sunday, five explosive devices were discovered in a trash can at an Elizabeth train station. Also on Saturday, a man who authorities say referred to Allah wounded nine people in a stabbing rampage at a Minnesota mall before being shot to death by an off-duty police officer. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. Authorities have not drawn any connection between the violence in Minnesota and the bombings in the New York area. Citing the FBI, New Jersey State Police said Monday that the bombings in Chelsea and the New Jersey shore town Seaside Park were connected. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said as investigators gathered information, they learned there were ""certain commonalities among the bombs,"" leading authorities to believe ""that there was a common group behind the bombs."" Before Rahami's capture, Cuomo said investigators have no reason to believe there are further threats, but the public should ""be on constant guard."" Around the time Rahami was taken into custody, President Barack Obama was in New York on a previously scheduled visit for a meeting of the U.N. General Assembly, and said it was ""extremely fortunate"" nobody was killed in the bombings. He called on Americans to show the world ""we will never give in to fear."" ""We all have a role to play as citizens to make sure we don't succumb to that fear. And there's no better example of that than the people of New York and New Jersey,"" the president said. ""Folks around here, they don't get scared."" Rahami lived with his family in Elizabeth in an apartment above a fried-chicken restaurant owned by his father, on a busy street a few miles from the Newark airport. Early Monday, FBI agents swarmed the apartment. Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage said Rahami's father, Mohammad Rahami, and two brothers sued the city after it passed an ordinance requiring the First American Fried Chicken restaurant to close early because of complaints from neighbors that it was a late-night nuisance. Ryan McCann, of Elizabeth, said that he often ate at the restaurant and recently began seeing the younger Rahami working there more. ""He's always in there. He's a very friendly guy, that's what's so scary. It's hard when it's home,"" McCann said. In the immediate aftermath of the New York bombing, de New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Cuomo were careful to say there was no evidence of a link to international terrorism. Both said Monday that appeared to be changing. ""The more we learn with each passing hour is it looks more like terrorism,"" de Blasio said in an interview on NY1 News. Cuomo said on MSNBC: ""Today's information suggests it may be foreign-related, but we'll see where it goes."" On Sunday night, FBI agents in Brooklyn stopped ""a vehicle of interest"" in the investigation of the Manhattan explosion, according to FBI spokeswoman Kelly Langmesser. She wouldn't provide further details, but a government official and a law enforcement official who were briefed on the investigation told The Associated Press that five people in the car were being questioned at an FBI building in Manhattan. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the investigation. On Sunday, a federal law enforcement official said the Chelsea bomb contained a residue of Tannerite, an explosive often used for target practice that can be picked up in many sporting goods stores. Cellphones were discovered at the site of both the New York and New Jersey bombings, but no Tannerite residue was identified in the New Jersey bomb remnants, in which a black powder was detected, said the official, who wasn't authorized to comment on the investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. The pipe bomb that exploded Saturday in Seaside Park went off before a charity 5K race to benefit Marines and sailors. The race was canceled.

"Story highlights Obama said anger should instead be redirected toward pushing needed reforms Obama also offered debate advice to Democrat Hillary Clinton an interview with ABC Washington (CNN) Protesters angry over the police killings of unarmed black men won't prompt change through violence, President Barack Obama said during an interview Thursday. Speaking a day after riots erupted in Charlotte over the killing of Keith Lamont Scott, Obama said anger should instead be redirected toward pushing needed reforms. ""The way we change the system requires us to be able to reach out and engage the broader American community. And that requires being peaceful,"" Obama said during an interview with ABC News. ""The overwhelming majority of people who have been concerned about police community relations doing it the right way. Every once in awhile, you see folks doing it the wrong way."" Obama -- who also offered debate advice to Democrat Hillary Clinton in the interview -- said the violence that has raged in cities such as Charlotte, Baltimore and Ferguson, Missouri, shouldn't distract Americans from real concerns about systemic biases within US law enforcement agencies. ""I think it's important to separate out the pervasive sense of frustration among a lot of African-Americans about shootings of people and the sense that justice is not always always, you know, colorblind,"" he said.

"LIBS MAD! School Warns They Will Do EVERYTHING Necessary To Protect Students ? Teachers ARMED? Progressive liberals are only interested in ?protecting children? when they get to define protection, which, apparentlydoesn involve using firearms, but it DOES include dismembering them for themother convenience. Since their definition of protection is kind of wonky, one school has decided to take the safety and well-being of your child into their hands and libs are going bonkers. Tonobody surprise, this school is in Texas. Some of the parents are perfectly okay with the sign and knowing the people who are supposed to protect their students can actually do so, if someone comes into the building with intent to harm. ?Schools have been a target for, for lack of a better word, crazy people, andI perfectly fine with it,? said Jillian Sides, who has two sons, one in 7th grade and one in kindergarten, at the school. The school also plans to place additional signs at all entrances to the school, so everyone entering the school knows that the teachers are packing heat. ? 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy NowLet set up a scenario for the people who might be against teachers having guns.Let say you are dead broke and are at risk of losing your home. You decide, in a moment of desperation, that the only way to gather the money to pay off your debts is to commit robbery. So, you sit down and have a think. Do you rob a bank? Do you rob a convenience store? Do you rob your neighbor up the street? How do you make this decision? Well, banks have pretty serious security. Cameras, sometimes armed guards and buttons that alert the police to any incident taking place. The local 7/11? They installed security cameras the other day after another robbery and you know from talking to one of the clerks that they now have a shotgun under the counter. What about the neighbor who has a ?proudly anti-gun? sign in their yard? Chances are that the security at that house is very low. So, any person thinking of committing a crime would be led to believe that hitting the building with the least amount of security would be the safest bet. Sorry, Mr. Jones, that means you. Criminals and crazy people know that schools are hugely gun-free zones, so they can cause the most amount of harm and chaos without fear of physical retaliation. Theydon want to be confronted by a courageous individual with the ability to stop them, so they go to places where the odds of running into one of those is very low.

"8422 SHARES SHARES FacebookTwitter GooglePinterestDiggLinkedin Reddit Stumbleupon PrintDeliciousPocketTumblr Jimmy Kimmel had an opportunity to bash Donald Trump in front of an audience of millions at the Emmys and he did not disappoint. He even went afterTrump enablers who were sitting in the audience. Kimmel opened the ceremony by poking fun ofHollywood elite and making several sarcastic but pointed jokes about diversity. ?Thisyear nominees are the most diverse ever. And here in Hollywood, the only thing we value more than diversity is congratulating ourselves on how much we value diversity. The Emmys are so diverse this year, the Oscars are telling peoplewe one of their closest friends.? But his greatest moment came when he mocked Trump. And called out the guy who made him a reality television celebrity. Kimmel sarcastically riffed about the existence of television making it possible for such self-aggrandizing and bombastic egotists like Trump to thrive. ?If itweren for television, would Donald Trump be running for president? No. He would be at home right now quietly rubbing up against his wife Malaria, while she pretends to be asleep.? And when it came to who was responsible for creating the five-alarm dumpster fire that is DonaldTrump presidency, Kimmel singled out Mark Burnett, the brainchild behind Celebrity Apprentice. ?That?s right. That guy. Mark Burnett, the man who brought us ?Celebrity Apprentice. Thanks to Mark Burnett, wedon have to watch reality shows anymore, becausewe living in one. Thank you, Mark.? Perhaps only the guy who invented the infomercial is responsible for more suffering than Mark Burnett.That why Kimmel nominated Burnett to be the first one tossed overTrump wall, should Trump convince enough deplorables to vote against their economic self-interests.

"Betty Shelby, a white Tulsa police officer accused of fatally shooting an unarmed black man, turned herself into the Tulsa County Jail early this morning, and is now out on bond. She is accused of fatally shooting 40-year-old Terence Crutcher last Friday night. Shelby was arrested at 1 a.m. CT today for first-degree manslaughter and she was released less than 30 minutes later on $50,000 bond. First Court Date Her first court date is scheduled for Sept. 30. ""Officer Shelby, although now charged, is presumed to be innocent under the law until a judge or jury determines otherwise,"" the Tulsa County District Attorney's Office said. The Potential Sentence If she is found guilty, first-degree manslaughter carries a prison sentence of at least four years, according to the Tulsa County District Attorney's Office. Shelby's Job on the Police Force Shelby has not been fired from the force, the Tulsa Police Department told ABC News. Now thatshe been charged, the department said it will afford her full due process, and after the trial, the department will complete an internal affairs review and then a determination will be made regarding her employment. She is currently on unpaid leave but was originally put on paid administrative leave until the charge was filed. What Happened Last Friday After Shelby came across Crutcher's SUV in the middle of a two-lane roadway while it was still running, Crutcher ignored dozens of commands Shelby gave him, according to her attorney Scott Wood. She shot him as he allegedly tried to reach his arm into the open driver's side window. Crutcher's family attorneys maintain that the window was up, pointing to the blood spattered on it when he was shot. According to an affidavit by an investigator with the Tulsa County District Attorney's Office, Shelby reacted ""unreasonably by escalating the situation from a confrontation"" with Crutcher. Shelby became ""emotionally involved"" to the point that she overreacted, the affidavit states, adding that she was ""not able to see any weapons or bulges indicating a weapon was present."" She Was 'Very Distraught' Lawyer Says On Tuesday, days before her arrest, Wood told ABC News that Shelby ""is very, very distraught about ... the fact that she has taken a human life. She said the other day in her interview with homicide detectives, 'I was never so scared in my life as in that moment right then.'"" ""But, at the same time she wants the Crutcher family to know she meant no ill will ? this was not something that was done out of hate or anger,"" Wood added. ""She stopped there that day to try and help somebody. Things didn't go the way they should have. He continued, ""Her actions were objectively reasonable, and she did what she had been trained to do. Idon think criminal charges would be justified in this scenario."" Wood did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment today. The Crutcher Family Response Damario Solomon-Simmons, the attorney for Crutcher family, said it was ""apparent"" that Shelby had to be charged because ""a crime had been committed."" ""We are happy that charges were brought,"" Solomon-Simmons said in a press conference. ""But, let me be clear. The family wants and deserves full justice, and full justice requires not just charges but a vigorous prosecution and a conviction to those who shot and killed Terence for no reason."" ""We're going to break the chain of police brutality,"" he said, calling the charge against Shelby a ""small victory.""

Interested in Donald Trump? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Instead, Trump suggested that a 400-pound hacker could have targeted the Democratic National Committee, accused Democratic officials of mistreating Sen.

The exchange was one of several missed opportunities for Trump inMonday presidential debate, according to congressional Republicans who tuned in to the much-anticipated matchup. ?I wish Trumpwould hit some of the softballs a little harder,? said Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., who watched the debate with colleagues. Republicans expressed frustration that Holt did not ask any questions about the Clinton Foundation or the Benghazi attacks while challenging Trump on his record on the Iraq War and real estate career. But lawmakers said the New York businessman should have taken every opportunity to bring up those issues, which have doggedClinton presidential campaign. ?She might as well have emailed the Russians her email address!? Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Fla., exclaimed Tuesday aboutClinton use of a private email server. A recent Washington Post/ABC News poll found that just 36 percent of voters see Clinton as honest and trustworthy, compared with 45 percent for Trump. Trump, who has never run for public office, held limited debate practice and did not take part in any mock debates, according to campaign advisers, while Clinton was still preparing as late as Monday afternoon. Some top Republicans praised Trump for effectively making his case to American voters. ?I saw Hillary Clinton give a polished, well-rehearsed defense of the status quo,?

" To cap off a week in which police officers shot and killed two unarmed black men, a Georgia police officer has been arrested after it was discovered that she had fabricated a story about being shot by black man. Jackson Officer Sherry Hall has been charged with ?false statements, tampering, interference with government property and a violation of oath of office.? ?After following leads and evidence, the investigation has now revealed that there is no, and never was, a suspect shooter at large in Jackson, Georgia? announced special agent Joe Wooten, who was investigating the ?case.? Hall reported that on September 13th, a black man had shot her in her bulletproof vest, but it was discovered that the entire thing ? radio call, tear in shirt, spent shell ? was all a set-up. The story is a stark reminder that the word of the police cannot always be taken at face value. When a protester was shot in the head during the Charlotte riots, the police immediately announced it was a civilian-on-civilian shooting, but multiple eyewitness reports say that it was a rubber bullet fired by riot police. A picture emerged of recently slain disabled black man Keith Lamont Scott showing a gun on the ground ? but the video released by his grieving wife shows no gun but instead shows a cop dropping his glove. A police officer in St. Louis, Missouri, was recently charged with a homicide after it was discovered he had shot and killed a black man and then planted a gun on his body to justify his murder.

"HillaryClinton recent reference to many of DonaldTrump supporters as a ?basket of deplorables? comprised of racists and homophobes only made explicit what her advertisements and other public statements have insinuated. Three weeks ago, she released a video that confronts Trump with the support he has received from white supremacists. In it, Jared Taylor, editor and founder of the white-supremacist magazine American Renaissance, is quoted from an interview with CNN: ?Sending out all the illegals, building a wall, add a moratorium on Islamicimmigration?s very appealing to a lot of ordinary white people.? Story Continued BelowIt pretty obvious what Clinton hopes to get from this line of campaigning: UnderscoringTrump endorsements from white supremacists might deter moderates, independents and mainstream Republicans who are loath to be associated with the right-wing fringe. However, her mudslinging also condemns Trumpvoters of them, atleast may supportTrump social platform, but not in the interest of institutionalizing the supremacy of white people. These white working-class voters support Trump because he articulates their complicated discomfort with immigration and demographic change. Some observers are quick to call themracist certainly some are. But over the past six months,I interviewed more than 100 white working-class people both here and in the United Kingdom, where a similar nationalist surge has triggered accusations of racism. My interviews suggest that there is a complexity toTrump supporters that is not as simplistic as a yes-no binary about whetherthey racist. Millions ofTrump supporters exist in the vast space between Wall Street and Breitbart. Is it racist to associate immigration with the greater globalization of commerce that has altered the economic prospects of outmoded people? Is it racist to be frustrated that members of ethnic minorities are rendered new advantages unavailable to white people, such as affirmative action policies and ethnicity-specific advocacy? Is it racist to believe that white working-class people are underrepresented in political leadership or vilified in popular media?Clinton decision to lump all voters with these concerns into the sweeping category of racistmight motivate her base, and might even be correct as a short-term political calculation: She probablywon win over these voters. Butthere a long-term societal risk here: Shunning them as racists pushes them only deeper into pockets of private discomfort, where their perceptions go unexposed andunchallenged their views and further polarizing the American public. Ultimately,Clinton statements will worsen a long-term social dilemma among the voters she broad-brushes?how Americans understand racism itself. *** Racismis a powerful word in American culture, and an important one to talk about.It the right way to describe the long history of prejudice and discrimination against people on the basis of their looks and ancestry.It also important to identify in modern society, linking contemporary expressions and ideas to earlier injustices, such as the enslavement of blacks or the genocide of native people. While they may not be equivalent, housing discrimination and police violence against African-Americans?enduring forms ofracism thus rightly seen as legacies of past oppression. This is valuable because it contextualizes the choices and policies of contemporary Americans in our troubled history of race. However, allegations of racism are now viewed by many white people as a means of wielding their ancestors? misdeeds to unfairly disqualify their dissenting viewpoints in the present. In the view of many of the voters Trump is speakingto just the ?alt-right,? but disaffected white voters across theboard?s crucial to talk frankly, even critically, about the perils of Islam, immigration and Black Lives Matter, even if it means offending some listeners. And on the more politically activated end of that spectrum, such voters see suppression of their ideas is part of a broader conspiracy to impose a liberal worldview.It a perception that has been seized by Trump??We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore,? he said in his July GOP conventionspeech also by far-right leaders in Europe, likeBritain Nigel Farage, the former head of the UK Independence Party and one of the leaders behind the UK's departure from the European Union. Both Trump and Farage have heralded the power of their countries? ?silent majority??a hushed constituency of predominantly white voters whose views have long been ignored. Many of these purportedly ignored views scapegoat minority groups for broader socialproblems based on stereotypes, myths and prejudice. But even well-meaning conservative critiques of social policies have been tarnished by far less valid accusations of racism. From the timeI spent interviewing white working-class people in the United States and the UK,I seen how many people findTrump andFarage unfiltered statements refreshing. The two men elevate hearsay to podiums and shout the very ideas that supporters have been too intimidated to mutter under their breath. In Britain, dozens of my respondents would often preface their most candid thoughts to me by stating ?I?m not a racist, but ? ? ?I?m not racist, but thiscountry covered by blacks and Bosnians.? ?I?m not racist at all.I got black cousins and nieces. But the Polish have been taking all of the work and running prostitution and drug rings.? ?I?m not a racist. I fucking love goat curry, pardon my language. But the principle of English families not coming first is just not right.? These individuals had not endured hours of sensitivity training; they were concerned that their ideas would be disqualified, when they are, in fact, sincere expressions about how their societies are being transformed. Racism is perceived to be a ?mute button? pressed on someone while they are still crying out about a sense of loststatus a position of historic advantage, frequently in terms they have difficulty articulating. Therefore, the preface ?I?m not racist? is not a disclaimer, but rather an exhortation to listen and not dismiss or invalidate the claims of a group that feels marginalized. Interestingly, those respondents who were able to more specifically articulate their frustration framed it in the civil rights themes of equality and justice. An unemployed 18-year-old Londoner said, ?You go for an interview and most of the employers are Asians. Basically,they discriminating against us, and we were here first. I have some training as a retail sales assistant. But whenI submitted my CV,I been told that Ican apply becauseI not Asian. ? I feel likeI beneath them.? Back in the United States, an electrician from Youngstown, Ohio, told me that ?white people have become the minority itself. ? People have freaked out on me for thingsI said because Ican say anything [about black people] because of slavery and their historical oppression. Peoplearen looking for equality;they looking for retaliation.? These two were not members of any white-supremacist group. Many white working-class individuals simply view the broader struggle against racism as one that demotes white people, rather than promotes others to equal ground. They feel estranged from minority groups, who they believe have access to new privileges that compensate for historic advantages thattoday white working-class people do not recall exploiting. They feel alienated from an urban white bourgeoisie, which has divorced their less skilled or geographically isolated co-ethnics and look down upon them. And they feel blamed for neither empathizing with the plight of minorities, nor mobilizing to overcome structural poverty and embrace global cosmopolitanism. *** To govern effectively, Hillary Clinton needs white people to buy into the social change she heralds. So instead of casting them as outmoded bigots, she could point to how the very social forces that entrench white working-class people into poverty also entrench minoritygroups there are no white problems or minority problems; there are just problems. She can assert that the status quo for white (and nonwhite) working-class people is reinforced not by the pursuit of political correctness, but instead by the propagation of racial divisions between us. By dismissingTrump supporters asracist rightfully in manycases further numbs many white people to the sensitivity with which racism was once regarded. It erects a barrier betweenClinton pursuit of equal justice and the defensive holdouts with whom she must ultimately cooperate to achieve her vision of social progress. Silencing and demonizingTrump supporters as racists simplistically shuns them into the ideological silos that segregate our society. We will never find common ground if wedon share space.

"Bill Clinton's speech will be a ?personal reflection? on his 15 years at the Clinton Foundation. | Getty Bill Clinton preps his defense Thecandidate husband seesWednesday speech as a last chance to defend hisfoundation work. Hiswife operatives are hunkered down in debate prep, but Bill Clinton is waging a campaign of his own, trying to clear the name of a foundation that has caused controversy in the 2016 race. The former president views the final glitzy meeting of his Clinton Global Initiative ? which he will address on Wednesday in an emotional farewell ? as his last big opportunity to counter accusations that the philanthropy served as a vehicle for wealthy foreign donors to curry access with hiswife State Department. Story Continued Below Between his appearances on stage this week, Clinton was still writing the speech; it will be a ?personal reflection? on his 15 years at the Clinton Foundation, according to a person familiar with his thinking. He aims to explain how ?CGI helped redefine philanthropy.? He also is expected to make an impassioned argument that the foundation has improved lives around the world ? a statement he hopes will serve as a powerful rebuke of the controversy that has turned his post-presidential work into a political obstacle for Hillary Clinton, adding to the damaging perception that the Democratic nominee is untrustworthy. Bill Clinton is not expected to mention Donald Trump or even hiswife campaign, the source said. Instead, he will aim for an optimistic tone and tell the audience that ?when you appeal to the best in people, you get the best. And when you appeal to the worst in people, you get the worst.? But with 48 days left in this contest ? and voters in focus groups still expressing concern about what they view as inside dealing for foundation donors seeking special access ? many Democrats said they were baffled by the formerpresident decision to carry on with the conference at all. Trump has seized on the foundation, accusing the Clintons of selling access. And on Monday, the Republican National Committee said thefoundation ?continued acceptance of foreign contributions while [Hillary Clinton] runs for the White House is an unprecedented and unacceptable conflict of interest that undermines her ability to serve.? The foundation in August announced it would no longer accept corporate or foreign contributions if Hillary Clinton wins the White House and that CGI would come to an end regardless of the election outcome. But even allies worried that this year's conference was an unforced error that served only to cede the spotlight to the wrong Clinton just as the Democratic nominee needs to promote her own case to voters. ?They would have been better off postponing it this year,? said one member of the Democratic National Committee and a Clinton ally. ?The foundation has been a negative this year, with concerns about donors seeking influence and access ? why shine light on it right before the debate?? One source close to Bill Clinton said putting it off simplywasn an option. ""They had no choice,? the ally said. ?These things are set up long in advance and usually get good press. They never thought it would be such a problem.? The former president seemed determined to turn it into an opportunity to change the narrative. Bill Clinton, close allies said, has been furious about what he sees as the smearingof hislife work, the AIDS relief and the global fight on behalf ofwomen rights overshadowed by questions of where the foundation gets its money. And both Clintons, sources said, have been frustrated that Hillary Clinton's Brooklyn-based campaign has not done enough to explain the philanthropic work the charity does at home and abroad, or that its mission is moral, not financial. Throughout the week, the former president was determined to use what may be his final solo spotlight to regain the moral high ground. ""In real life, if somebody tells a lie about you, and I find out it is [a lie], I like you more and them less,? Bill Clinton told NPR earlier this week. ?In political life, if they just keep on smearing you ? even if it all comes to nothing ? people will like you less and won't hold anybody accountable for what they say."" Sitting down with CNBC in the middle of the day Tuesday, he added: ?I've learned already in this election, some people were just subject to a presumption of guilt just because they were participating.? HillaryClinton campaign went on offense too; it highlighted a Washington Post report that Trump used $258,000 of hisfoundation money for his personal legal defense. ?Today has provided a stark contrast between the potentially illegal activities of the Trump Foundation and how the Clinton Foundation is improving millions of lives here in the U.S. and around the world,? said Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin. ?That's a debate we'll have anytime."" The showcase gathering, held annually at the Sheraton near Times Square, typically brings together Fortune 500 CEOs, world leaders, celebrities and nonprofit leaders ? a high-wattage assembly that, this year, runs counter to the current populist mood across the country. Even the snacks served catered to the limousine liberal set; vegan ?energy squares? made of fig, hazelnut and cacao nibs, and multigrain crisps smeared with almond butter and maple syrup, were served between ?breakout sessions.? While Bono and formerVictoria Secret model Doutzen Kroes took the stage on the opening day alongside leaders like Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, the event seemed slightly more toned down than in previous years ? and in some ways more like a Clinton friends-and-family reunion. Some of the participants from previous years, including Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent, declined invitations this year, a source familiar with the planning said. But former Clinton aide Doug Band attended the opening plenary session. Marjorie Mezvinsky, whose son is married to Chelsea Clinton, flashed iPhone photos of her grandchildren to friends. Stalwart allies including former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards and longtime Clinton friend Melanne Verveer gamely participated in panels, and expressed regret that the organization was winding down. ?The decision has been made,? Verveer, a former Clinton White House aide who now heads up the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, said of shutting down CGI. ?It?s really bittersweet. There's a sense of nostalgia.? Democrats, meanwhile, have been increasingly incensed at what they see as a double standard applied to the two presidential candidates ? especially as more revelations come to light about how Trump ran his own foundation. ?No one is saying, ?Whydon you put your hotels aside, or your money-making enterprises aside,?? said Dan Pfeiffer, a former top aide to President Barack Obama. ?For Hillary Clinton, for some reason, helping deal with AIDS in Africa is something that should be put aside.? From the stage, at least, Bill Clinton was careful not to go down the political, or defensive, road. When London Mayor Sadiq Khan tried to bait him into discussing Trump ? ?It?s no coincidence that some of those involved in the Brexit campaign are involved in another campaign taking place somewhere else this November,? Khan said ? Clinton smiled but kept his mouth shut. Instead, he spent most of his time on stage doing what hecan do at campaign rallies for his wife: talking at length about his own presidency and his own views of the world. ?In my home, I have two beautiful, highly unique samples of large rocks that came out of Bosnia,? he said during one panel. ?It?s one of the most geologically interesting places on earth.? Even if the discussion was about old rocks, there was a sense of anxiety hanging over the conference. When asked how she felt about the tightening polls, Verveer winced. ?Fingers crossed,? she said.",0.03525641,0.00534188,0.007478632,0.009615385,0.050213675,0.261752137,0.002136752,2,-1,1

"Story highlights Donald Trump addressed a recent fatal police shooting at the church of Pastor Darrell Scott The Republican presidential nominee said, 'You have somebody in there that always makes a mistake' Cleveland Heights, Ohio (CNN) Donald Trump said Wednesday he was ""very troubled"" by the fatal police shooting late last week in Oklahoma of an unarmed black man and suggested the officer in question ""got scared"" or was ""choking."" Trump offered his first public reaction to the shooting during an event at the church of Pastor Darrell Scott, a black supporter who asked Trump for his reaction to the police shootings of black men in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina. Trump began his response by praising police and noting he has been endorsed by several law enforcement groups, but added that ""you always have problems."" ""You have somebody in there that always makes a mistake, that's bad or that chokes,"" Trump said, using a term he often uses to describe somebody who falters under pressure.

"Washington  The FBI released Friday nearly 200 pages of notes from its investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server, just three days before she squares off against Donald Trump in the first presidential debate. The notes, taken from interviews of top Clinton aides, supporters and others, include details of how a close Clinton confidant explained how the State Department made sure the White House system would not bounce back the emails from the then-secretary of state. But the documents -- a summary of which had already been released in the overall FBI report -- provide little in the way of major bombshells. Politically, however, Friday's release helps keep the issue relevant before the debate. The release also comes hours after news that top Clinton aide Cheryl Mills had obtained a limited immunity deal from the FBI in order to cooperate with its investigation. In one exchange, an unidentified interviewee details alleged efforts by a top State Department official, Patrick Kennedy, to argue during the release of the Clinton emails for classifications that would protect her. But Kennedy, in his own interview, denied the charge. Top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, in her interview, explained how they had to update email addresses with the White House so Clinton could email President Barack Obama because the President could only receive emails from approved addresses. If her email was not on an approved list, which was managed by the President's staff, the White House server would reject it. When Abedin was shown a 2012 email exchange, she did not recognize the pseudonym -- when agents explained it was Obama, she replied, ""How is this not classified?"" There is no evidence Obama knew that Clinton was using a private email server at the time. He has said he only found out about her use of it when it became public. Many of those who communicated with Clinton have told the FBI they didn't realize she was using a private server, and often one may not realize what email address is behind a name unless one clicks on it. Agents also interviewed ""Guccifer"" -- the hacker who targeted the Bush family -- who detailed his successful infiltration of close Clinton friend Sidney Blumenthal's email account and reviewed 30,000 emails and downloaded 25 attachments. Guccifer also detailed taking a screenshot of one Blumenthal exchange regarding the Benghazi attacks. In other interviews released Friday evening, Clinton aides seemed generally unconcerned about her use of a private email server and said she adhered to standard security measures -- arguments they have made extensively in public. But one IT worker took a somewhat cavalier attitude, joking in one interview that a new 60-day retention policy was a ""Hillary coverup operation"" -- which sparked the Trump campaign's anger. ""The fact an IT staffer maintaining Clinton's secret server called a new retention policy designed to delete emails after 60 days a 'Hillary coverup operation' suggests there was a concerted effort to systematically destroy potentially incriminating information,"" Trump spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement. ""It's no wonder that at least five individuals tied to the email scandal, including Clinton's top State Department aide and attorney Cheryl Mills, secured immunity deals from the Obama Justice Department to avoid prosecution."" The latest revelations in the Clinton email scandal are certain to play a central role in Trump's line of attack Monday, when the two meet for their first presidential debate in New York. Trump has built his ""Crooked Hillary"" line of insults off arguments stemming from her emails. The additional notes were released three weeks after the FBI released its report from its investigation of Clinton and her emails, as well as the notes from Clinton's own high-profile interview with federal agents. Clinton, in her interview, said she did not know about key records retention policies and whether she was violating rules. But on the trail, her campaign and supporters have routinely said she did not break any laws with her email handling. No criminal charges FBI Director James Comey in July took the unprecedented step of announcing in a press conference the FBI's conclusion that there was not enough evidence to merit a criminal prosecution, before handing over his findings to the Justice Department. The DOJ followed that recommendation and decided no prosecution was merited. After Comey testified about the decision before Congress, members requested access to his agency's report. Last month, the bureau gave members of Congress access to the notes, as well as notes from interviews with other Clinton staff and aides, but kept that version of the report classified. Comey testified that no transcript of the interview exists, only the notes taken on it. Clinton was not under oath.",0.038112522999999995,0.016333938,0.005444646,0.016333938,0.08711433800000001,0.264972777,0.0,2,-1,1
"Michigan has become a hotbed of hate as Muslims have been allowed to take over much of the state and impose their ?religious rights? on everyone who was there before them. After years of this infiltration, fueled in large part by BarackObama refugee program and the town of Dearborn becoming the Middle East of Michigan, citizens have had enough. The entitled ride of thinking they can take over has just come to an abrupt end with the rude awakening they just faced by one brave individual leading the charge of making the state American again. The nature of the Islamic religion does not allow Muslims to assimilate into Western culture ? they want to dominate it since everything America stands for is counter to their beliefs. Michigan has systematically been forced to bow down to Islam under the pressure of our previous president who herded thousands of refugees into their state and allowed one town, in particular, to become unrecognizable as an American city ? Dearborn ? which looks more like the Middle East with its predominately Muslim population of approximately 103,000, according to WXYZ. Muslims? plan is world domination asthat what their holy book preached for them to achieve. Key to that plan is the implementation of Sharia Law which they try to slowly establish under the radar here in America, without anyone realizing it beforeit too late. Wise to their disguise is Michigan Representative Michele Hoitenga whoisn taking a backseat to political correctness and just got proactive about stopping Muslims in their tracks with a nasty surprise she just slapped them with. With a new president in charge, states are starting to feel empowered to take assertive action against Islam in America, as was seen this week by what Hoitenga who just proposed a bill to ban Sharia Law. MLive reports: ?Michigan residents would be banned from using other countries? laws in court under a bill proposed by Rep. Michele Hoitenga, R-Manton, according to an email obtained by MLive. In an email sent to state lawmakers seeking co-sponsors on Monday, Hoitenga said her billdoesn specifically mention Sharia Law, but wrote that it would include the religious law association with Islam. ?If you have not heard by now, a doctor in Detroit is being charged with operating an underground clinic that actively engaged in genital mutilation on young girls, essentially practicing a fundamentalist version of Sharia Law,? Hoitenga wrote in the email.?Hoitega timingcouldn have been more important as she saw first-hand the horrific results of Islam and Sharia Law in her own state last week when a female doctor was arrested for what she had been doing to Michigan girls who were not Muslim. Federal prosecutors accused 44-year-old Muslim Dr. Jumana Nagarwala of performing female genital mutilation on unsuspecting little girls in her Detroit-area E.R. As expected, Hoitega faces an uphill battle with this bill in getting it past state Democrats who must not see a problem in disturbing crimes like Dr.Nagarwala who was forcing the sickest part of her religion on little girls. Hoitega wants to prevent more of this from being acceptable by law, whichshouldn be up for debate sinceit completely contradictory to the U.S. Constitution, which liberals love to ignore. Had this been a measure to prevent any other religion from gaining dominance over people, Democrats would be demanding that it pass and wreaking havoc on city streets if they were denied. We reported before that Michigan is under a siegeof Muslims as was captured by an undercover journalist with a video camera. A siege is currently taking place slowly and quietly, making a casualty of one city at a time. The first city to fall is Hamtramck, Michigan. But soon after it will be Dearborn. Michigan. And before we even know it, the whole nation will surrender our values, morals, and freedoms in the name of humanityand ?tolerance. Detroit Free Press Reports: Hamtramck residents have elected a Muslim majority to thecity six-member city council, symbolizing the demographic changes that have transformed the city once known for being a Polish Catholic enclave. InTuesday election ? with six candidates running for three seats ? the top three vote-getters were Muslim, while the bottom three were non-Muslim. Two of the Muslim candidates, Anam Miah and Abu Musa, are incumbent city councilmen, while newcomer Saad Almasmari, the top vote-getter, also was elected. The seat of another Muslim incumbent councilman, Mohammed Hassan, was not up for re-election, and incumbent City Councilman Robert Zwolak came in fifth place. Some believe the city is the first in the U.S. with a Muslim majority on its city council. Four of the six council members will be Muslim: three of them of Bangladeshi descent and one Yemeni. ?Hamtramck has made history,? said Hamtramck community leader Bill Meyer. ?The election was far from close, with the three Muslim winners each gaining over 1,000 votes, while the other three candidates garnered less than 700 votes each.? Councilman Musa, who came in second place, told the Free Press that he will work to represent everyone in the city regardless of background. ?I?m a very good Muslim,? said Musa, an immigrant from Bangladesh. ?I try my best to pray five times (a day), but when I get elected, every single ethnic votes for me, not (only) the Muslim vote for me, but Christians, every single ethnic group, African-Americans, Polish.I a good friend of the Polish.? ?I represent every single citizen in Hamtramck,? he said. ?I?m serving all city of Hamtramck.? Formerly known for its Polish population, Hamtramck is now about 24% Arab (mostly Yemeni); 19% African American; 15% Bangladeshi; 12% Polish; and 6% Yugoslavian (many Bosnian), according to U.S. Census figures. The percentage of residents who are Muslim is unclear since the U.S. Census does not ask about religion. Estimates of the Muslim population range from one-third to more than one-half of city residents. Almost all of the Yemeni Americans in Hamtramck are Muslim, while the growing Bangaldeshi-American community in Hamtramck has Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists. The city has a Bangladeshi Hindu temple and Bangladeshi mosques. On Friday, Gov. Rick Snyder attended the opening of Bangla Town, an area that will celebrate Bangladeshi-American culture in Hamtramck and bordering Detroit neighborhoods. About 41% of the city are immigrants, the highest percentage among cities in metro Detroit. Pope John Paul II, who was Polish, visited Hamtramck in 1987; a statue of him commemorating his visit is in a city park. Three of the Muslims onHamtramck City Council are of Bangladeshi descent, while Almasmari is of Yemeni descent. Thecouncil only other Arab-American Muslim in its history was Abdul Algazali, who died in February. The issue of Islam has sometimes come up in recent years as the Muslim population grows. After contentious debate, the city allowed in 2004 the Muslim call to prayer to be broadcast publicly five times a day from mosques through loudspeakers. The call to prayer has drawn complaints from residents who sayit loud and intrusive, waking them up early and bothering them. City Council candidate Susan Dunn, who came in fourth place, raised the issue during the campaign, prompting a response from Almasmari during a city council meeting last month. ?We all want to live peacefully and respectfully,? he said to the council during the October meeting, according to a video he posted to his Facebook account. ?Our special thing is ? the diversity in this town.? Almasmari said the call to prayer ?is not as loud as (Dunn) thinks.? Moreover, if ?we are considering the call to prayer as noise,? then so would ?the loud music all night long while we are sleeping.? ?We as Muslims respect our neighbors and wedon like to bother anybody,? he said. ?As the Prophet Mohammed said: he who believes in Allah and the last day, let him not harm his neighbors.? Meyer, who is not Muslim, said that Muslims in Hamtramck ?have helped bring stability, security and sobriety while lessening the amount of drugs and crime in the city.? h/t: [AmericanLookout]",0.027689031,0.007454739,0.01171459,0.008519701999999999,0.037273695,0.28860489899999997,0.056443024,2,-1,0

"Plastic glasses, knives, forks and food boxes are being been banned in France. (Bertrand Combaldieu/Associated Press) PARIS ? France has apparently become the first country in the world to ban plastic plates, cups and utensils, passing a law that will go into effect in 2020. Exceptions will be allowed for items made of compostable, biosourced materials. The new law is a part of thecountry Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, the same legislation that also outlawed plastic bags in grocery stores and markets beginning in July. Although plastic bags are forbidden in other countries ? including in some U.S. states ? no country seems to have embraced a plastic ban as sweeping asFrance will be. The general idea behind the law ? following the landmark conference held in Paris last fall on curbing global warming ? is to promote a ?circular economy? of waste disposal, ?from product design to recycling,? French lawmakers say. [A Marylandcounty nickel tax for plastic bags is paying off, but not as planned] Objections to plastic as a material are well known. For one, it does not biodegrade and only breaks down into smaller and smaller particles, which pose a significant danger for wildlife that cannot always distinguish it from food sources, particularly in oceans. Aside from ecosystem disruptions, millions of barrels of oil are used every year in manufacturing plastic bags and utensils, playing what environmental activists call a significant role in climate change. In the words of French PresidentFran Hollande, the ban is part of a larger push intended ?to make France ? an exemplary nation in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, diversifying its energy model and increasing the deployment of renewable energy sources? -- starting, it would seem, with the forks and knives distributed at fast-food restaurants and the coffee cups in vending machines. Not all share the enthusiasm ofFrance Socialist government, which has made environmental progress one of its main goals. In Brussels, some argue that the laws violate existing European Union legislation regarding the free movement of goods and the protection of manufacturers. Eamonn Bates, the secretary general of Pack2Go Europe, a Brussels-based association that represents packaging manufacturers on the continent, told the Associated Press that his organization will challengeFrance ban. ?We are urging the European Commission to do the right thing and to take legal action against France for infringing European law,? he said. ?If theydon, we will.? Supporters of the ban wanted it to be introduced earlier, possibly as soon as 2017. ButS?ne Royal, the French environment minister, had initially considered it an ?anti-social? provision, on the grounds that low-income families relied on plastic utensils and plates. The ban was then postponed until 2020.",0.015151515,0.003030303,0.003030303,0.003030303,0.015151515,0.23030303,0.003030303,2,-1,1

"A mother is outraged after council chiefs removed her deceasedson star-shaped headstone following a complaint from another family who claimed itwasn ?in keeping? with the rest of the cemetery. Max Corbett-Gardener was just 4 years old when he passed away after complications from his severe epilepsy. His mother, Jo Corbett-Weeks, 42, saved up $4,580 to design a specially-made headstone featuring a teddy bear holding a star inscribed with a tribute to her son, the Daily Mail reports. The heartfelt memorial was erected onMax grave to commemorate what would have been theboy seventh birthday. But three days later, the headstone was removed from Great Malvern Cemetery by council chiefs in Worcestershire. ?It would have been Max's seventh birthday on the Sunday, and this was like a birthday present to him from me,? Corbett-Weeks, who has two other children ages 16 and 5, told BBC. ?I chose a star-shaped stone because I wanted something suitable for Max - something personal. ?This stone is just so perfect for my poor little chap,"" she added. A family had complained to the Malvern Town Council that the headstone was not ?in keeping? with the rest of the cemetery. Corbett-Weeks says the stone was then removed without her knowledge or consent and she is demanding that it be reinstated. ?I was totally unaware this was going on. The council did not contact me and it was the stonemason who told me he'd been ordered to remove it,? Corbett-Weeks explained. ?I feel upset, distressed and angry. We have been through so much as a family. I could understand if the grave was uncared for or unsightly, but it isn't. ?The headstone meant a lot to me and the family but now we are fighting to have it put back,"" she said. ""It's a horrible situation. We just want to have somewhere to grieve.? The memorial was placed in the adult area of the cemetery, where Corbett-Weeks had her son buried so that he could be close to other family members. The council said that if the application for the stone had been received within the usual time frame, they would not have given the stonemason permission to install it in the first place. They added that had the star-shaped headstone been installed at thechildren area of the cemetery, it would have been allowed. ?We have a conformity of shapes in our lawn cemetery. We were contacted by people who objected to the shape,? a Malvern Town Council spokesman explained to BBC. ?The longer it stayed up, the harder the process would have been. ?It was a very difficult decision to remove it but one we had to make straight away,"" the spokesman said. The council added that the complaint was not so much about the shape of the headstone as it was about following protocol. 'It wasn't necessarily an objection to the shape but why we appeared to be applying one rule to one family and other rules to another,? the spokesman continued. ?The stonemason in this situation did not have permission to put the stone up - and the stone is not in keeping with the graves in that area. ?By not following the correct process he has caused considerable distress to both families,"" the spokesman concluded. The council is arranging a meeting with Corbett-Weeks to discuss a new design for herson headstone.

"Senator Mark Kirk (R-IL) has been caught red-handed lying about the details of his military service, and itisn the first time he has done it. From The Huffington Post: CNN reported Wednesday thatKirk campaign website erroneously stated that he is ?a veteran of the Iraq War.? In reality, the senator stayed in the United States during the war as he served in the Navy Reserve. His campaign chalked it up to a staff error, saying that particular page onKirk website was not meant to be public and that staff members were making edits to it. Staff moved the page behind a password-protected firewall after CNN investigated. Kirk, who is up for re-election this year, has previously been caught in the middle of lies about his military career. He claimed in 2010 that he had been named ?Intelligence Officer of the Year,? when the award was for work his entire unit had done. He also promoted a story alleging that his reconnaissance plane had come under fire, but there was no record of that. Kirk claimed that he had served in combatin Kosovo, but hedidn. He claimed he had been deployed to Afghanistan, but he had been sent there for training, not for combat service. He also previously falsely claimed to have been deployed to combat in Operation Desert Storm.Kirk lies about his service would be a major issue at any time, but they are even more notable because he is facing a strong challenge from Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL). Duckworth is an actual combat veteran who served in the Iraq War. In that conflict, Duckworth received a Purple Heart after her helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade.

"Story highlights Donald Trump criticized Hillary Clinton for her approach to national security issues It's a recurring theme of his campaign Estero, Florida (CNN) Donald Trump, speaking two days after the latest terrorist attack on US soil, sought to paint his rival Hillary Clinton as a ""weak and ineffective"" leader not prepared to confront the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, as he talked up his radical policy prescriptions. The Republican presidential nominee, addressing more than 8,000 people at his first rally since the bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey, talked up his hardline immigration policies, argued domestic terror suspects, even US citizens, should be tried as ""foreign enemy combatants"" -- rather than receive due process under US law. He also slammed Clinton for what he said was being tougher on his supporters than on Islamist terrorism. ""Hillary Clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about radical Islamic terrorists,"" Trump said, pointing to Clinton's comments that half his supporters belong in a ""basket of deplorables."" ""Has she ever talked that way about radical Islam? No,"" Trump said. ""Are those words reserved only for hard-working Americans who truly love our country and they want to make a statement? One can be forgiven for getting the impression that these hardworking Americans are somehow a greater threat to our country than these Islamic extremists.""

"The beginning of the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump included statements that would have ended the campaign of any other politician. Has an announcement speech ever looked so much like a flashily produced political suicide? Did he really just call a key part of the electorate criminals and rapists? Ever since his blunt, racially divisive debut in Trump Tower in June 2015, Trump has proven that gaffes do not singe his hide like they do the fragile and fretful politicians who tiptoe through the typical campaign for public office. Time and again, Trump poured gasoline on himself and lit a match. Time and again, pundits predicted fatal self-immolation. Instead, Trump often rode the ensuing firestorm like an Atlas rocket. His poll numbers actually went up after he insulted JohnMcCain war record. What mainstream politician has ever said something like that, much less received a boost out of it? The only thing more stunning thanTrump dismantling of campaign norms has been how consistently he has flirted with disaster. Story Continued Below He has insulted brown people, black people, Muslim people, Jewish people. He has insulted women. He has insulted the grieving parents of a dead soldier. He has mocked a disabled person and expressed admiration for dictators. He has ham-handedly pandered to a politically critical portion of the population by posting to social media a picture of gringo Tex-Mex captioning it, ?I love hispanics!? He has suggested he could shoot somebody and not lose votes. He has openly talked about the possibility of the assassination of his opponent. Twice. And these are just the insults, not the demonstrable falsehoods. It helped him dispatch 16 challengers in the extended primaries of a party of which he has been an off-and-on member, and it has taken him to Monday night, to the first of three debates against HillaryClinton best chance yet to get an edge in the race to become the 45th president of the United States.

"Story highlights Jeh Johnson spoke to senators at a hearing Tuesday Cyber threats have raised questions about Election Day Washington (CNN) Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told a Senate hearing Tuesday that 18 states have taken up his agency's offer to help improve cyber security for their election systems, in the wake of suspected breaches blamed on Russian hackers. ""We are seeing a limited number of instances where there have been efforts through cyber intrusions to get into the online presence of various state election agencies. And, one or two of them have been successful, others have not,"" Johnson said at a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing. The issue of the integrity of US elections has been a prominent one on the presidential campaign trail, with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic Sen. Harry Reid each raising concerns about possible rigging of the results. Both Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, said at Monday's debate that they would respect the election results. Asked by Sen. Jon Tester, D-Montana, whether hackers are seeking to change votes, Johnson said: ""What we are seeing are efforts to get into voter registration rolls, the identity of registered voters, things of that nature, not to change a ballot count."" Johnson said the matter was still an active investigation and that the source of the intrusions hadn't been concluded.

"White Plains, New York  When Donald Trump tried to score points by saying that Hillary Clinton had spent days off the campaign trail to prepare for Monday night's debate, Clinton -- having spent days off the trail to prepare -- had a ready reply. ""I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,"" Clinton said wryly after Trump hit Clinton for taking time off the trail. ""And, yes, I did. You know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing."" The line was not spontaneous. According to sources inside Clinton's debate prep, Trump and his surrogates telegraphed his line of attack as they were hitting Clinton for the time off before the debate. So they looked for a way to flip the line on the Republican nominee and urged Clinton to use it. But it wasn't the only pre-planned moment in a debate that became a prolonged opposition research dump on the Republican nominee. The most damaging may be when Clinton used the story of Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe who says Donald Trump called her ""Miss Housekeeping"" as a way to counter sexism on Trump's part. Near the end of the debate, when Trump didn't back away from saying Clinton didn't look like a president, the former secretary of state pounced. ""He called this woman 'Miss Piggy,' then he called her 'Miss Housekeeping' because she was Latina,"" Clinton said. ""Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a US citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November."" Trump didn't back away from the line, interrupting Clinton as she spoke with ""Where did you find her?"" Quickly, the Clinton campaign blasted out a video about Machado's story. On Tuesday, they held a press call with the former Miss Universe, who said that cried when she heard her name mentioned on Monday. When asked how the back-and-forth has played with Spanish speaking media, a Clinton aide had a one-word response: ""H-U-G-E."" Afterward, Clinton's aides were giddy about how the debate played out, using words like ""unhinged"" to describe Trump. That glee was compounded when they heard Trump went to the spin room and complained about the microphone, claiming that his was defective. ""Anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night,"" Clinton said. Aides acknowledged that they felt Trump effectively hit Clinton on trade, especially in attacking her support of the North American Free Trade agreement, a deal her husband -- who was sitting in the audience -- approved as president. Clinton tried to distance herself from the Trans Pacific Partnership on the debate stage, and Trump correctly said that she called it the ""gold standard"" as secretary of state. And one aide also said that while Clinton's email answer was shorter and more succinct than past answers, no one inside the campaign likes it when Clinton spends any time explaining her decision to use a private email server as secretary of state. But for the most part, there was no hiding the enthusiasm on Clinton's side. She received a loud ovation from staff and crew boarding her campaign plane Tuesday morning. Clinton poured herself into debate prep for days before the Monday contest. The former first lady conducted two-a-day debate sessions on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, not leaving the Doral Arrowwood hotel and spa until past 11 p.m. ET to return to her nearby home. Ron Klain, who advised President Barack Obama and ran part of Hillary Clinton's debate prep, played moderator Lester Holt during he session, according to a Clinton aide. Klain played only one version of Holt, aides said, believing that the NBC anchor would fact check Trump when confronted with a blatant falsehood but also leave it to Clinton to do some fact checking, too. Aides who were in on the debate preparations said Philippe Reines, a longtime adviser who played Trump in the sessions, poured himself into the role, sporting a red tie and large cufflinks to look like the businessman. Reines, who spent hours studying Trump's policies and debate performances, acted out some of the Republican nominee's mannerism during the prep, including a hand gesture that the campaign called ""the cobra"" -- where Trump brings his fingers together like a snake ready to pounce. While Reines didn't try to mimic Trump's voice, aides said the longtime adviser's rendition of the Republican nominee was so on point that even Clinton was surprised. As she came off the stage Monday, Clinton had the highest of praise, an aide said. ""Wow, that sounded exactly like Philippe,"" Clinton said.",0.042477876,0.0017699120000000002,0.0,0.007079645999999999,0.060176991,0.26371681399999997,0.0,2,-1,1

Ryan, a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces; Edward Mansfield, an Iowa Supreme Court justice; Keith Blackwell, a Georgia Supreme Court justice; Charles Canady, a Florida Supreme Court justice; Timothy Tymkovich, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit; Amul Thapar, a U.S. District Court judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky; Federico Moreno, a U.S. District Court judge for the Southern District of Florida; and Robert Young, the chief justice of the Michigan Supreme Court.Trump decision earned praise from Judicial Crisis Network Director Carrie Severino, who clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas. ?Donald Trump continues to take unprecedented steps to demonstrate that he intends to appoint justices like Scalia, Thomas and Alito,? Severino said in a statement. ?Conservatives should be very pleased by the steps he has taken, and if he lives up to his promises we will have a Court that truly puts the rule of law ahead of political preferences.? Lee has refused to endorse Trump for president, although he did offer praise for Trump's first list of potential justices unveiled in May, which included his brother Thomas, a Utah Supreme Court justice. ""It wasn't just that there were some great names on that list, that was the best, most conservative Supreme Court shortlist I've ever seen,"" Lee said at the time. ""And I was thrilled by that.""

"What would possess anyone to take control of the Internet away from the United States and put it under control of ICANN, composed of 182 foreign countries? That cannot bode well for freedom of speech, thought, and ideas. Senator Ted Cruz leads the fight in these videos. Congress MUST ACT NOW! As Written By Senator Ted Cruz: The Obama administration is pushing through a radical proposal to take control of Internet domains and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries. If that proposal goes through, countries like Russia, China, and Iran could be able to censor speech on the Internet, including here in the U.S. by blocking access to sites theydon like.

" This Friday, the Trump camp released a new list of ten more potential judges that he would consider to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court. This list includes a former law clerk to Justice Samuel Alito, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT). Lee believes that federal child labor laws, Medicare and Social Security are all unconstitutional and is arguably the most conservative member of the United States Senate. The list gave us new reasons to fear the Presidential candidate, by giving us insight into the legislative agenda the Donald will push if elected president. The list was tailored to appease hard line conservatives and skeptics, containing candidates from the whole spectrum of the right, from judges who believe the less the judicial branch intervenes the better, to those that want to get rid of the minimum wage and fundamental labor legislation guaranteeing basic protections. Mike Lee, in a statement, said he appreciated being considered. ?Right nowI focused on my job in the Senate, whereI in a good position to defend the Constitution by fighting against government overreach. Both lists thatI seen from the Trump campaign are fantastic.? In 2010 Senator Mike Lee described his interpretation of the Constitution in detail in a since-deleted YouTube video. In a segment of the video, Lee calls attention to the toughnessof the decision in Hammer v. Dagenhardt, which challenged a federal law abolishing child labor by asserting child labor laws ought to be within the power of the state instead of federal jurisdiction. Congress decided it wanted to prohibit [child labor], so it passed a law ? no more child labor. The Supreme Court heard a challenge to that and the Supreme Court decided a case in 1918 called Hammer v. Dagenhardt. In that case, the Supreme Court acknowledged something very interesting ? that, as reprehensible as child labor is, and as much as it ought to be abandoned ?that something that has to be done by state legislators, not by Members of Congress. [?] This may sound harsh, but it was designed to be that way. It was designed to be a little bit harsh. Lee uses this separation of powers argument as his defense for a number of other ?tough,? radical right ideas about peeling back federal powers.That because Lee is part of a movement whose members are convinced New Deal-era reformers plotted to illegallyexploit Depression-born desperation and expand the federalgovernment powers. People within this movement interpret the 10th Amendment of the Constitution as explicitly prohibiting spending programs and regulations disfavored by conservatives. Programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act are illegal in the eyes of people like Mike Lee, borrowing ideologically from the John Birch Society and the Libertarian Party platform of 1980, which demanded that we live in a completely darwinistic, plutocratic, and privatized world where there is no taxation, no safety nets of any kind, and political strings are entirely pulled by the purse, with zero checks on the marginal power of capital. The prospect of appointing someone like Mike Lee to the Supreme Court is terrifying because his agenda is to unleash unlimited spending in political elections to opportunistically help himself, while helping corporate stooges repeal every major piece of legislation that has resulted in gains for the poor, the homeless, the sick, the middle class, and the most disenfranchised inAmerica marginalized communities.

"She?s on a warpath right now andit tearing up Twitter and social media outlets as we speak. This day is all about the survivor and the attacker and a day in remembrance of what happened in the90.It being considered as a terrible attack that happened in the White House that left a youngwoman reputation damaged and a President impeached. This is the story of Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky andshe celebrating her 20th year of that horrible time in American politics. The White House was disgraced. Awoman dress defaced. And everyone in the world had their eyes on the White House as an impeachment process added to the fledgling reputation of former President Bill Clinton. Monica Lewinsky claimsshe a survivor after what happened with her sexual encounter with Bill Clinton. Some call it an attack. Some call it mutual. Everyone calls it repulsive because Bill Clinton was caught in a raunchy expose with an intern while he was married to Hillary Clinton. But Hillarydidn leave his side. She stayed on the path of politics, not caring much about what her husband was into (or putting into) and she usedBill name and reputation to push her career forward while he took a back seat after his romp with Lewinsky. Bill Clinton was probed 20-years ago and the memory and backlash of the sexual encounter have always left a stain on the reputation of Lewinsky. Thatdidn stop her from being successful in her ventures after the impeachment of Bill Clinton. She refused to allow the incident with the former President of the United States to stop her in on the path to success. She pushed forward, full steam ahead, and she brandished herself a survivor. Shewasn physically attacked with punches, kicks, or weapons, but her character was nearly assassinated. She went from being an intern to a name everyone knows. People know her, her dress, and something about cigars that wewon get into. And now, still, Lewinsky pushes on as she claims herself a survivor from what was possibly her most tumultuous year. Gateway Pundit reports: ?Twenty years ago today Special Counsel Kenneth Starr contacted Attorney General Janet Reno to get permission to expand his probe of Bill Clinton. Janet Reno agreed and submitted the request to a panel of three federal judges. The judges agree to allow Starr to formally investigate the possibility of subornation of perjury and obstruction of justice in the Jones case. Tripp and Lewinsky meet again at the Ritz-Carlton. FBI agents and U.S. attorneys intercede and take Lewinsky to a hotel room, where they question her and offer her immunity. Lewinsky contacts her mother, Marcia Lewis, who travels down from New York City by train. Lewis contacts her ex-husband, who calls attorney William Ginsburg, a family friend. Ginsburg advises her not to accept the immunity deal until he learns more. Three days later, an January 19, 1998, Matt Drudge at The Drudge Report broke the story first on the Monica Lewinsky Scandal. And that led to the impeachment vote of President Bill Clinton.? Is the combination of Matt Drudge and Monica Lewinsky the reason for BillClinton impeachment? Perhaps as a secondary reason. The true reason for BillClinton impeachment is Bill Clinton himself. His inability to remain distant from Monica Lewinsky, regardless of who approached who is the sole reason an impeachment was ever more than an idea. If he allowed himself to be in close quarters and inadvertently in a sexual encounter with an intern, then the full blame must be placed on him. Citizens have extremely high standards for the President of the United States of America and sexual encounters with an intern are not on the unwritten list of approved behaviors. Monica Lewinsky shared her 20-year anniversary Tweet and it began a chain of survivor Tweets.It a great story to see her posting positive messages to the public. However, we must remember that it takes two to tango. Since she was an intern, then it must have been theworld biggest accomplishment to ?hook up? with the President. But for Bill Clinton, he let down his wife, his country, and his intern when he allegedly engaged in sexual activity. Bill Clinton should have said NO so that Monica Lewinskydidn have to say #MeToo. Butlet not forget ? the encounter with Bill Clinton was only the beginning.Don forget what Hillary did to try and ruin her life. Hillary may not have slept with Monica Lewinsky, but Mrs. Clinton is very capable of doing a lot of other things. Monica has gotten off easy. Enjoy her Tweets.Her is somewhat whiny, but there are some true survivors in the pack and may God be with them all. ?????? for 20 years, i've marked 16 jan as the day i survived another year from 1998. on this 20th (!!!) anniversary, thinkin' maybe we could try a survivor's chain. whaddya think?

"Cheryl Mills, a longtime Clinton aide, received an immunity deal from the Justice Department during the investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails. | AP Photo Top Clinton aide Cheryl Mills granted partial immunity in email investigation A source says the immunity offer came after the FBI interviewed Mills when investigators asked to go through her computers to see if it still contained classified information. Top Hillary Clinton aide Cheryl Mills received an immunity deal from the Justice Department in theFBI investigation into the former secretary ofstate private email server, records shown to Congress revealed Friday, re-injecting the email controversy into the presidential campaign just days before her first debate with Donald Trump. In addition to Mills, Clinton's former chief of staff at State, grants of partial immunity were also extended to former Clinton aide Heather Samuelson, who worked as State's White House liaison and later as a private attorney for Clinton and to John Bentel, who was director of the the Information Resources Management section in the secretary of state's office, lawmakers said. Story Continued Below The newly disclosed information brings to five the number of individuals known to have received some form of immunity in connection with the FBI probe, which ended with the bureau recommending that no charges be brought against Clinton or her aides for mishandling classified information. ""This is beyond explanation. The FBI was handing out immunity agreements like candy,? House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said Friday in a statement. ?I've lost confidence in this investigation and I question the genuine effort in which it was carried out. Immunity deals should not be a requirement for cooperating with the FBI."" The immunity grants to Mills and Samuelson were narrow, covering only their handover of laptops used in 2014, after Clinton left State, to conduct a review of the former secretary's emails to separate work-related messages from those purely personal in nature. The immunity came after the women were interviewed by the FBI and did not cover any of their statements. People familiar with the immunity offer said it was not related to the lawyers' testimony, noting that FBI Director James Comey said in July there was no evidence of a deletion aimed at frustrating the investigation. A lawyer for Mills and Samuelson, Beth Wilkinson, said she requested the immunity grants because of inter-agency disputes about whether some information in Clinton's emails was classified. ""As the government indicated in these letters, the DOJ and FBI considered my clients to be witnesses and nothing more. Indeed, the Justice Department assured us that they believed my clients did nothing wrong. At all points my clients cooperated with thegovernment investigation, including voluntarily participating in interviews with the FBI and DOJ,"" Wilkinson said in a statement. ""The letters released to the Hill today only covered the computers that my clients had used in performing their legal work,"" Wilkinsion added. ""Because of the confusion surrounding the various agencies? positions on the after-the-fact classification decisions, I advised my clients to accept this letter from DOJ."" Bentel, however, received immunity before speaking with the FBI, people familiar with the situation said. Former State employees told agency investigators Bentel brushed back their concerns about Clinton's email setup. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee stressed in a statement emailed to reporters that the immunity offers to Mills and Samuelson were ""very limited."" ""These very limited immunity agreements did not extend to any testimony before Congress, statements to the FBI, or assertions to any other investigators,"" they said. The Clinton campaign attributed the information's release to the proximity of Monday's presidential debate. ""House Republicans are trying to make something out of nothing by rummaging through the files of a Justice Department investigation that was closed months ago without any charges whatsoever, and leaking selective details three days before the first presidential debate,"" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement, noting that Mills and Samuelson cooperated fully with the FBI's inquiry and ""had already given full interviews to the investigators."" A top aide to Donald Trump's presidential campaign said word of the additional immunity grants underscored the recklessness of Clinton's conduct. ""Revelations that three additional individuals, including Cheryl Mills, were granted immunity from prosecution in HillaryClinton email scandal shows this was without a doubt a criminal scheme,"" Trump aide Jason Miller said in a statement. ""At its heart,Clinton secret server was an end run around government transparency laws designed to hide corruption between the Clinton Foundation and her State Department, an arrangement which ultimately put our national security and sensitive diplomatic efforts at risk. No one with judgment this bad should be allowed to serve as president of the United States or hold any public office."" Miller also suggested that the immunity grants were aimed at preventing Clinton from facing justice in the case. ""What has become abundantly clear is that the Obama administration is protecting Hillary Clinton from accountability at all costs because she will keep the rigged system in Washington in place. In light of this development, Hillary Clinton must immediately come forward and promise the American people that none of these individuals will ever serve in any capacity in her administration,"" the Trump aide added. For weeks, House Republicans have been seeking the FBI's full file in the probe and, last week, issued a subpoena demanding the records. Republicans disclosed the immunity agreements just after learning about them in investigative records shown to congressional staff by the Justice Department on Friday. Immunity offers to witnesses are not made by the FBI, but by the Justice Department. A department spokesman declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the FBI had no immediate comment. It was previously disclosed that prosecutors granted immunity to former State Department computer specialist Bryan Pagliano and to a computer technician Clinton hired through a private firm, Paul Combetta of Denver-based Platte River Networks. The immunity deals for the two appear to be broader than those given to Mills and Samuelson, although no one in the probe is known to have received full immunity.

"Talks of hiring Rex Elsass come as Donald Trump is getting walloped on the airwaves. | Getty Trump team talking to veteran GOP ad man Elsass DonaldTrump campaign, hoping to counter HillaryClinton air assault, is in talks with veteran GOP ad maker Rex Elsass, according to three sources familiar with the discussions. Elsass, according to one of the sources, met with Trump officials in New York City last week. Story Continued Below Elsass has deep connections to the Trump campaign. He previously served as a top strategist to vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, and in 2012 he worked with Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway for Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin, who came under widespread criticism after making controversial remarks about rape. Elsass is a partner at Strategy Group for Media, a firm that has also counted Jim Murphy,Trump national political director, as an employee.Trump advertising campaign has been led by Jamestown, a prominent political consulting firm with an anti-establishment edge. Two Jamestown employees, Jason Miller and Larry Weitzner, have taken senior roles in the campaign. Also helping to lead the Trump ad effort is Rick Reed, a veteran GOP strategist who assisted the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign against John Kerry in 2004. Discussions about bringing aboard Elsass come as Trump is getting walloped on the airwaves. On Sept. 12, Smart Media Group, a media buying firm that works with the Republican National Committee, detailed in an email to Trump campaign officials how Clinton was outspending the Republican nominee on TV by an astonishing seven-to-one margin. With polling in many battlegrounds suggesting the race is tight, many Republican strategists are concerned thatTrump lack of commercial spending could pose problems as the contest enters its final seven weeks. The Ohio-based GOP operative has a long history in Republican politics, having worked for a number of presidential candidates over the years. During thisyear primary season, Elsass advised Rand Paul and, followingPaul departure from the race, John Kasich. In 2012, he worked for Michele Bachmann and Newt Gingrich.

She added, ""When I confronted him with the reasons why he won't release his tax returns and I got to that point where I said, 'Well, maybe he's paid zero,' he said that makes him smart. Now, if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make all the rest of us?"" Clinton, who took several days off the campaign trail to prepare for the candidates' first face-off, also said her opponent was ill-prepared. ""He made it very clear that he didn't prepare for that debate,"" she told the crowd of roughly 1,400. ""At one point he was kind of digging me for spending time off the campaign trail to get prepared. But just trying to keep track of everything he says took a lot of time and effort.""

"Donald Trump took full advantage of the opportunity Monday to return to blasting Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for failing to keep the country safe in the wake of this weekend's bomb attacks in New York City. And Clinton jumped on the news to prosecute her own case against Trump: that he is a dangerous demagogue whose inflammatory rhetoric puts the nation at further risk. The polls offer a more nuanced picture. Voters trust Clinton over Trump by a narrow margin when it comes to terrorism and national security ? a reversal from past elections when Republicans were seen as the party stronger on national defense. Butthat not the end of the story:Trump supporters are far more concerned about terrorism thanClinton, suggesting the GOP nominee could appeal to voters who are increasingly anxious about safety at home. Story Continued Below The attacks this weekend present a new backdrop to the one-week run-up to the first general-election debate ? a one-on-one showdown on national television between Clinton and Trump, held fewer than 30 miles from the scene of an explosion on the west side of Manhattan that wounded more than two dozen people on Saturday evening. Both candidates on Monday sought to reinforce their credentials on terrorism and spin it into an advantage. Clinton held a press conference at a suburban New York airport before traveling to Philadelphia, calling herself ?the only candidate in this race who has been part of the hard decisions to take terrorists off the battlefield.? Trump, meanwhile, responded with a statement on Facebook, saying Clinton ?has emboldened terrorists all over the world to attack the U.S., even on our own soil,? adding that terrorists ?are hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes [p]resident ? so that they can continue their savagery and murder.? Overall, polls conducted prior to this weekend give the Democratic nominee a slim advantage on the issue. In lastweek Fox News poll, Clinton edged Trump among likely voters asked who would do a better job handling terrorism and national security, 47 percent to 46 percent. Among registered voters surveyed by CBS News/New York Times over a similar time period, 49 percent trusted Clinton more on national security and terrorism ? which rated a close second to the economy and jobs on a list of most-important issues ? compared to 45 percent for Trump. In a Quinnipiac University poll last week, 49 percent of likely voters said Clinton would do a better job ?keeping the country safe from terrorism,? while 47 percent said Trump would do a better job. And in an ABC News/Washington Post poll this month, half of registered voters said they trust Clinton more to handle terrorism, more than the 41 percent who trust Trump ? though that margin narrows to 48 percent for Clinton to 45 percent for Trump among likely voters. Clinton, multiple polls show, is viewed as having experience and as the better informed, more stable leader. In the Fox News poll, 61 percent of likely voters say the former secretary of state is ?qualified to be president,? far more than the 45 percent who say Trump is qualified. Fifty-nine percent think Clinton ?has the temperament to serve effectively as president,? compared to only 38 percent who say Trump is temperamentally fit. But voters also see Trump as a decisive candidate who will tell it like it is and is more committed to attacking the Islamic State in the Middle East. In a slightly older CNN/ORC International poll, conducted over the first four days of this month, half of voters said the phrase ?a strong and decisive leader? applied more to Trump than the 42 percent who said it applied to Clinton. (That poll, the only live-caller national poll Trump has led since the conventions, also found Trump ahead on the issue of terrorism, 51 percent to 45 percent.Clinton slight edge on terrorism and national security in most polls reverses what was a traditional Republican advantage. For decades, voters have seen the GOP and its presidential nominees as stronger on defense. As an incumbent in 2004, then-President George W. Bush enjoyed a sizable advantage on terrorism over then-Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.). A CBS News/New York Times poll in early October of that year found more voters had confidence that Bush (52 percent) would make the right decisions when it came to protecting against a terrorist attack than had confidence in Kerry (39 percent). Barack Obama faced a similar gap in the 2008 campaign against Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was lauded as a Vietnam War hero and has focused on defense issues during his time in the Senate. Voters throughout the campaign trusted McCain over Obama on terrorism, according to ABC News/Washington Post polls, though the gap between the two candidates narrowed toward Election Day. In 2012, Obama, with the benefit of incumbency and the killing of Osama bin Laden the year before, grabbed the advantage that year over former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Obama was generally more trusted on foreign policy, according to data from the Pew Research Center, and exit polls showed more voters trusted Obama to handle an international crisis than Romney. But even though more voters, on average, trust Clinton over Trump on terrorism, rising unease about more attacks could benefit the Republican. Prior to this weekend, Trump voters were far more concerned about terrorism: In lastweek Quinnipiac University poll, a combined 79 percent of likely voters said it was veryor somewhatlikely that there would be a terrorist attack in the U.S. ?in the near future ? causing large numbers of lives to be lost.? (No one was killed in thisweekend incidents.) Virtually all ofTrump supporters, 96 percent, said it was at least ?somewhat likely? there would be an attack in the near future, including a 57-percent majority who saidit ?very likely.? But just 64 percent of Clinton backers said it was likely, and only 19 percent said it was ?very likely.? That anxiety extends to voters? own lives. A combined 47 percent of likely voters said they are at least ?somewhat concerned? that they or someone in their family ?will be the victim of a terrorist attack? ? with, again, a sharp break by the presidential candidate they support. More than two-thirds ofTrump voters, 68 percent, said they were at least ?somewhat concerned? about being the victim or someone in their family being the victim of a terrorist attack ? while only 29 percent of Clinton supporters were concerned about it. This has also been a traditional Republican advantage: Voters most concerned about terrorism have tended to support the GOP ticket in large numbers. In 2008, McCain defeated Obama among the quarter of Americans who were ?very worried? about a terrorist attack in the United States, 54 percent to 43 percent, according to the exit poll. But in the past two elections, terrorismhasn been a major issue for voters. In that 2008 exit poll, only 9 percent of voters said terrorism was the most important issue, and McCain won them overwhelmingly, 86 percent to 13 percent. The 2012 exit polldidn even ask voters about terrorism, though a September 2012 Pew survey found Romney voters (68 percent) were significantly more likely than Obama voters (55 percent) to say terrorism was ?very important? to their vote. The last time terrorism was a significant factor in a presidential campaign, the Bush-Kerry race in 2004, 19 percent of voters in the exit poll rated it as their most important issue. Bush carried them by 72 points, 86 percent to 14 percent.",0.025498891,0.003325942,0.00443459,0.013303768999999998,0.049889135,0.311529933,0.033259423999999996,2,-1,1
"Last night, Fox News reporter Steve Harrigan was reporting live in Charlotte, North Carolina to cover police brutality protests that had erupted after a shooting. Perhaps because Fox News has typically shamed these kinds of protests and ran footage that depicted protesters as thugs and looters in the past, Harrigan got his a** handed to him by a protester thatdidn hesitate to confront the notoriously racist network. The female African American protester went right up to Harrigan and decided to educate him about why she and other protesters had gathered. When Harrigan tried to shame her for being outside in an area where someone had just gotten shot, the protestercouldn tolerate his ignorance and white privilege any longer. Harrigan made the mistake of asking her, ?If a man was shot about 50 yards over there, wedon know by who. Why are you here?? And that was it. The protester went off, and replied to Harrigan, ?Because I serve a purpose? right before giving him a brutal lesson in racism. She forcefully said that no matter where she is, at any given moment she could be shot just because of the color of her skin. She said: ?I could be at work, at school, in my car, I can still get shot ? by the police!? Pointing out the fact that racism still exists in America, she continued: ?We are not the same. We are human, but I am black and you are white sodon tell me not to come over here?? Harrigan tried to jump in, but the protester quickly called him out for ?using sarcasm? as a crowd began to gather, and accused the network of only being at the protests so that they could get video footage and ?make a f*cking fabricated story? ? which we all know Fox News has done in the past.

"Milwaukee Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. has been a fixture on Fox News in recent months, appearing on multiple programs on that network to attack the Black Lives Matter movement, which he has compared several times to international terrorists. Clarke has also been an outspoken supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, and is often one of the first names Trump backers bring up when attempting to highlight support for the candidate among black voters. Clarke spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this past summer. But while he was busy on the cable network attacking the black community, a man died in the jail under his command. He reportedly died of thirst, of all things. Terrill Thomas, 38, was found dead in a Milwaukee County Jail cell on April 24, nine days after being arrested in connection with a shooting. Other inmates heard Thomas beg for water in the days before he died, the Journal Sentinel reported in July. [?] Last week the Milwaukee County medical examiner announced that Thomas? death was due to profound dehydration, according to the Journal Sentinel. By labeling the death a homicide, the medical examiner indicated that it was caused by the actions of another person, although that judgment does not necessarily mean that anyone will be criminally prosecuted in the case. Inmates at the jail say the water in Thomas? jail cell had been cut off for 6 days, and that one inmate warned jailers about the danger to theman life. Attorney Erik J. Heipt told the site that he has received calls from other inmates to tell him that the water had been cut off to their cells, and another inmate died in 2011 when his water was cut off as well. Clarke is reportedly part of a pro-Trump bus tour arranged by a super PAC that is supporting the candidate. The Huffington Post also reports that Clarke took in over $150,000 in 2015 from ?speaking fees, travel reimbursements and gifts.?

Sitting down withCNN Erin Burnett in an interview set to air Wednesday night, Sisi had two words when asked whether he thought Trump would make a strong leader: ?No doubt.? Story Continued Below Asked whether he and Trump discussed the Republicannominee past proposals and remarks about Muslim immigration, Sisi made note of the U.S.? existing ?very strict security measures for everyone who wishes to visit it which has been in place for quite a few years.? ?It?s also important to know that during election campaigns many statements are made and many things are said, however afterwards governing the country would be something different,? Sisi told Burnett. ?And will be subject to many factors.? Burnett pressed, asking whether Sisi meant to say that Trump ?is saying what he needs to say to be elected but that he might not follow through with the plan.? ?Idon want to be unfair to anyone here. During election campaigns there is a perception based on a certain vision and a point of view,? Sisi remarked. ?Then that vision or point of view gets corrected and develops as a result of experience, reports and advice from experts."" As far as his separate meeting with Hillary Clinton, Sisi suggested the Democratic nominee would make a good president as well. ?Political parties in the United States would not allow candidates to reach that level unless they are qualified to lead a country the size of the United States of America,? Sisi replied. Asked aboutClinton comments in a past debate in which she referred the ?army dictatorship? under Sisi, the Egyptian leader hedged his response. ?I will answer this question in two ways. I believe that that statement was not made after our most recent meeting between myself and Mrs. Clinton,? Sisi said. ?But also in Egypt there will not be a chance for any dictatorship because in Egypt there is a constitution, there is law, and there the will of the people which will refuse to allow any leader to stay in his position for any period longer than his term which is four years.""",0.054545455,0.007272727,0.010909091000000001,0.032727273,0.101818182,0.341818182,0.0036363640000000004,2,-1,1

Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway toldMSNBC ?Morning Joe? co-hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough in an interview Monday morning. ?You saw ? and others were talking about it in the earlier segment ? that this weekend was spent by editorial writers and people on Twitter and elsewhere really just trying to undercut Donald Trump before the debate.?

"Washington  At least 858 people that had been ordered deported or removed under another name were improperly granted US citizenship due to a failure to maintain adequate fingerprint records, according to a new report. The failure occurred, in part, because older fingerprint records were not digitized as part of DHS or the FBI fingerprint databases and therefore could not be readily searched thereby preventing those who had been ordered deported or removed from being identified. Failure to digitize these records risks ""making naturalization decisions without complete information and, as a result, naturalizing additional individuals who may be ineligible for citizenship or who may be trying to obtain US citizenship fraudulently,"" the report added. ""US Citizenship and Immigration Services granted US citizenship to at least 858 individuals from special interest countries who had been ordered deported or removed under another name,"" according to the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General report The report describes special interest countries as ""generally defined as countries that are of concern to the national security of the United States."" At least one of the people identified as having improperly been granted citizenship is now working in law enforcement, the report said. It recommends the remaining older fingerprint records be digitized and that DHS review ""the eligibility of each naturalized citizen whose fingerprint records reveal deportation orders under a different identity"" and decide whether to seek denaturalization. The report noted that the department has concurred with its recommendations and has begun implementing corrective actions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Neema Hakim told CNN that ""DHS is and has been taking steps to address this issue"" including working to digitize the 1990s-era fingerprint records. But Hakim added, ""The fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization fraudulently."" ""Where the DHS review process finds that naturalization was obtained fraudulently, DHS will appropriately refer the case to the Department of Justice for civil or criminal proceedings, including for denaturalization,"" Hakim said. ""This failure represents a significant risk to America's national security as these naturalized individuals have access to serve in positions of public trust and the ability to obtain security clearances,"" Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, wrote in an open letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson. Failure to properly screen applicants for US citizenship, particularly from ""special interest countries,"" is likely to further fuel controversy over the screening of immigrants, a contentious topic during the 2016 election cycle. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has called for immigration bans targeted at countries with connections to terrorism. He had previously called for a temporary prohibition of Muslim immigrants. The apprehension of Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspected perpetrator of the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey, is similarly likely to draw attention to the screening process as Rahami immigrated to the US from Afghanistan and subsequently was granted US citizenship.",0.046575342,0.005479451999999999,0.0027397259999999996,0.01369863,0.071232877,0.271232877,0.005479451999999999,2,-1,1
"Reid accuses Trump of overstating wealth Seeking to shake up a tight presidential race, Sen. Harry Reid declared Tuesday on the Senate floor that Donald Trump is a swindlerwho is ?not as rich as he would have us believe"" ? as the Nevada Democrat moved to reprise the 2012 strategy that saw him hammer Mitt Romney repeatedly over his tax returns. Several times on Tuesday, the Senate minority leader called out Trump for declining to release his tax returns, suggesting thatit because those documents would show that Trump has far less wealth thanhe claimed. Trump has said his net worth is $10 billion. Story Continued Below ?He was born with an inheritance but lost hisdaddy wealth. ?That why Donald Trumpwon release his tax returns.That certainly one of the reasons, of course: He is not worth nearly as much as he claims to be.That a secret hedoesn want anyone to know,? Reid said in a scathing speech. ?He wants everyone to thinkhe this big, rich, rich man.? With just a handful of congressional days in session before the election, Reid is unleashing increasingly heated attacks on Trump and Senate Republicans supporting him. Last week, he called Trump a ?human leech? and suggested the business mogul is overweight, dropping the kinds of political bombs that most pro-Hillary Clinton Democratswouldn touch. For Reid,there less downside than for almost all other high-profile Democratic surrogates:He retiring in September and is looking to make as much of a mark on the race as he can. In a sit-down interview on Monday, he emphasized that Trump cannot sustain a charge in the polls that now has him closer than ever to catching Clinton, declaring that ?American polling is such a joke.? ?I?ve always been a pessimist;that just my nature,? Reid said in his office. ?Despite my base pessimism,I convinced that this election is turning. What Trump has done in the last couple weeks, youcan overcome that. Youcan do it.? While Reid has previously lit into Trump for his business dealings, his comments about income taxes on Tuesday are reminiscent ofReid efforts to paint Romney as a tax dodger in 2012, when Reid repeatedly came to the floor to declare that Romney did not pay any income taxes. Although his claims were ultimately unproven, Reid has never shown any remorse for his attacks on Romney, and in fact on Tuesday showed that he believes the tactics are effective enough to use again on Trump. Quoting Trump, Reid said that the GOP presidentialnominee personal wealth fluctuates with the financial markets ? which Reid said is cover for a man he said would be ?scammer in chief.? ?Simply put, Trump is faking his net worth because hedoesn want us to know thathe not a good businessman,? Reid said. ?Since 2008, Trump has not donated a single penny to his own charity ? does he have money to donate? He says he does, but hedoesn.? The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. And Republicansaren exactly rushing to shield Trump fromReid attacks; many, in fact, have said that Trump should release his tax returns in accordance with presidential tradition. ?I?m not going to comment about the presidential race or what our nominee should or should not do,? Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said Tuesday morning. Last week, Trump responded toReid months-long string of attacks on him from the Senate floor, telling The Washington Post that Reid should ?start working out again with his rubber workout pieces,? a reference to the devastating eye injury Reid sustained while exercising in 2015. Reid then went on a parade of media hits to strike back at Trump last week. In the interview on Monday, Reid said that because of his injury and his use of a cane, he is ?pretty sensitive? toTrump mockery of New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who has a disability. ?He denigrates people who are handicapped. He says that he thinks I should go out and do some more exercise, suggesting that I should blind myself in my other eye,? Reid said. ?Idon thinkthat really so good.?

"Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016We all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably ?read mylips new taxes,? a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat: Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. Hedidn promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.Let imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. Destroydoesn?t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty ?yeeeeehaw,? the reality is thathe talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America.He talking about profiling Muslims.He talking about DonaldTrump version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example,isn just a Muslim,he an The man being hunted by the FBI, for example,isn just a Muslim,he an American citizen with the right to due process. Just becausehe a suspect in a bombingdoesn meanhe guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked killand not on the most wanted list.There nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play. What that means is that underTrump dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you thinkI being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. Itisn about the narrative. Itisn about prevention or education.It about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening. The only solace we have is that whathe promising is nothing but another ?read my lips.? Terrorismisn something you can simply destroyjust because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but itisn going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of DonaldTrump campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.

"Story highlights ""She's a disgrace. She's a disgrace and those comments are a disgrace,"" Christie said Clinton has said the US needs to tackle ""systemic racism"" Washington (CNN) New Jersey governor and Donald Trump surrogate Chris Christie called Hillary Clinton ""a disgrace"" after she connected recent police shootings to ""systematic racism"" -- hours after the GOP nominee said he was ""very troubled"" by a recent incident in Oklahoma. ""She's a disgrace. She's a disgrace and those comments are a disgrace,"" Christie said Wednesday on ""The Laura Ingraham Show."" ""It's typical of Hillary Clinton.

Ingraham played comments Clinton made Tuesday on ""The Steve Harvey Show"" following the shooting of Terence Crutcher, a 40-year-old unarmed black man shot dead by police in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""And we've got to tackle systemic racism -- this horrible shooting again,"" Clinton said. ""How many times do we have to see this in our country? In Tulsa, an unarmed man with his hands in the air?

" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus appeared onCNN pre-Presidential Debate coverage Monday afternoon, absurdly joking with Wolf Blitzer that the RepublicanParty presidential candidate was ready for the debates because ?he?d already been through 14 season finales? ofTrump reality TV show The Apprentice. Of course, it makes absolutely no sense to equate a gaudy half-hour of programming that loosely classifies as entertainment with what is arguably the hardest and most significant hurdle in the journey to becoming the most powerful elected official on the planet, but false-equivalency is after all, the biggest theme of this election. In his latest act ?The Donald,? who is apparently ?not a fan of mock debates? because ?he can get bored,? has decided to eschew traditional methods of debate preparation, instead opting to watch footage of Mrs.Clinton best and worst debate moments to look for vulnerabilities. When asked aboutTrump preparation for the debates, Priebusdidn appear to be concerned about how Trump would perform at the debates, ?He?s very comfortable,? Priebus said. ?He did a great job in our primary debates. He will be prepared.He always shown up for the big dance.? Although Blitzer attempted to press Priebus for more specific details on how Trump is preparing for the debate, the RNC chair would not budge, saying he ?didn?t want to get into all those details,? and changing the conversation to discuss the Clinton campaign instead. The Trump-Clinton debate will be at Hofstra University in Hempstead, NY Monday night at 9:00 PM EST and will be broadcast across all the major networks. It is expected to be the most viewed television debate of all time, and could reach up to 100 million viewers, almost certainly affecting the outcome of the November election. Donald Trump made a name for himself in the fact-free zones that were the Republican primary debates, where a group of neocons, corporate shills, and religious extremists argued over who was willing to murder more Middle Eastern people and who hated government the most.

"Were you worried that Donald Trump might fall victim to a ?concentrated Satanic attack?? Yeah? Well, youaren alone. But good news folks, youdon have to worry about that anymore! God himself is now protecting the GOP nominee from the Dark Lord. On Wednesday, Trump attended the Midwest Vision and Values Pastors Leadership conference in Cleveland. Trump-loving black man who lost his damn mind pastor Darrell Scott was worried that Satan might be after Trump too, which is ironic since most of us assumed the Republican nominee was working for the Prince of Darkness already. Scott claims that before Trump began is bid for the presidency, a ?nationally known? preacher warned him ?that if you choose to run for president,there going to be a concentrated Satanic attack against you.? ?He saidthere going to be a demon, principalities and powers, that are going to war against you on a level thatyou never seen before andI watching it every day,? Scott said.Scott wife, Belinda Scott, prayed over Trump as those around him laid hands on the bigoted billionaire, making sure Satan knew they were serious, dammit: ?God we ask you right now that Your choice is this choice.? ?God, I ask that you would touch this man, Donald J. Trump,? she continued, ?give him the anointing to lead this nation.? Because what would Jesus do? Well, duh!He make America great again. And naturally, he would use a racist demagogue to do it.

"26 SHARES Facebook Twitter A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday night. He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers. The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person. The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim. St. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times. On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own.Adan terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday. Members and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for theterrorist family. The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an ?accomplished student? in high school (but of course). St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who ?happened to be in the right place at the right time.? Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law.That when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him. Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs. Last year the Washington Times reported thatObama administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota. The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls. ?This population is also being targeted by Islamist terror organizations like the Islamic State and al-Shabab, a Somalia-based group with links to al Qaeda, according to U.S. officials.? ?Among Minnesota-based Somali-Americans, American converts to Islam or Somali refugees, there have been numerous convictions for various levels of collaboration with Islamist terror groups, plus reports of fighting with al-Shabab or other Islamist groups.? ?Al-Shabab made a propaganda video warning of an attack on shopping malls around the world, including the Mall of America in Minnesota. Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the terror attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya two years ago, which left 67 dead.? In July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape. In May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat. ?Pro-Islamic State Somali militants have grown in numbers and are receiving financial and military support from Yemen, a top intelligence official told the VOA Somali Service.? ?He said Islamic State has welcomed its Somalia branch and has started delivering supplies through their affiliate faction in Yemen.? ?They received military supplies from Yemen ? weapons, uniform, ISIS sent trainers who inspected their bases, and they have started sending financial support,? he said. In June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS. In July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt to join forces to attack America. Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States. If Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%. Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone.It clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups.It clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota. Men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum. Hillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule. A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children.Don vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong. Selah.

"A former mayor in the State of Ohio has admitted to raping and molesting a little girl over a three year period, beginning when she was just 4 years old. However, what is more disturbing is the fact that he claims the child was a ?willing participant? and initiated the acts. Richard Keenan, a former Hubbard mayor, admitted to the crimes, according to the Trumbull CountyProsecutor Office. Vindy.com reports: Keenan, who served as Hubbard mayor in 2010 and 2011, was indicted last month on eight counts of rape and 12 counts of attempted rape and gross sexual imposition. A rape conviction carries a sentence of life in prison. According to the filing by Assistant Prosecutor Gabriel Wildman, Keenan, 65, made the admissions to his wife, a pastor, a social worker and his brother and sister-in-law.Wildman filing states that whenKeenan wife, Diana, heard about the assaults from the child, ?upon confronting [her husband] about the allegations, [Keenan] responded, ?I did it.'? The filing states Keenan also admitted sexual abuse during ?group discussions? while he was in the ValleyCare Trumbull Memorial Hospital psychiatric ward. Keenan also had ?in depth? conversations with his pastor in which he spoke of the molestation and rape. Mr. Keenan was also feeling suicidal because he had been abusing the child, according to a social worker from the Warren psychiatric facility, which he voluntarily admitted himself. He also said that the child initiated the act and even referred to her as a ?willing participant.? Now, questions are being raised as to whether or not his wife and pastor are able to testify against him. The Ohio Rules of Evidence state that a spouse is considered ?competent to be a witness if the testifying spouse elects to testify.? Additionally, the Ohio Revised Coder says that the pastor cannot be compelled to testify if ?the confession or confidential communication was made directly to the cleric.? Keenan was indicted in August on eight counts of rape and twelve counts of attempted rape and gross sexual imposition. He is free on $75,000 bond. If convicted, he faces life in prison. His trial is scheduled to be held prior to April 24, 2017. I have to ask, what need is there for a trial? Has the man not confessed to the crime? It is a waste of time and money. Furthermore, what is with sentencing a man to life in prison? Will his young victim not grow up to pay taxes to support food, clothing and housing for her rapist? What is just about that? We need a return to the Biblical model of law and justice, a model our forefathers followed.

"As millions of voters tune in to watch the first presidential debate of the 2016 campaign, there are several key issues to keep in mind. Interested in Elections? Add Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest The general election has been playing out for about two months now, with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton taking direct aim at each other, but tonight will be the first time that they square off directly. Watch the first presidential debate on ABC News and ABCNews.com at 9 p.m. Eastern time. on Monday. Debate Prep Plays Out Onstage Paul Hennessy/Polaris Clinton has been preparing for her 35th presidential election debate for weeks. Aides say the former secretary of state ? who is known for doing her homework ? has been poring over briefing books and practicing in mock debates with a Trump stand-in, Clinton's longtime aide Philippe Reines. She has said she expects it to be a ""difficult, challenging"" debate. Her campaign has even consulted with ""The Art of the Deal"" ghostwriter Tony Schwartz on how to beat him in a debate. Trump was in debate prep meetings all day Friday after focusing more on campaigning than studying up for the showdown. Though no mock debates occurred, he was asked rounds of questions he could face from tonight's moderator. The sessions were led by Trump surrogate and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, along with the campaign leadership. Testing Their Tones Mark Wilson/Getty Images Acknowledging that there are concerns about his tone, Trump has repeatedly said that he plans to be polite ? but only to a point. ""I'm going to be very respectful of her,"" Trump said during a interview on Fox News on Thursday. ""I think she deserves that, and I'm going to be nice. And if she's respectful of me,that be nice. We'll have something that I think people will respect as a debate, but we'll see where it all goes. You really never know exactly how it's going to turn out, and that's why we're going to have a lot of people watching,"" he said. For her part, Clinton and her team have spoken about how they had to prep by facing off against two versions of Trump: the more professional, contained version that has been present on the trail more recently and the more bombastic, uncontrolled version that was seen more during the primaries. Famous Faces in the Audience Chelsea Clinton will attend the debate, a first for her this election cycle, after not attending any of the Democratic primary debates. And another familiar face is expected to be in the front row supporting Team Clinton: Mark Cuban. The billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner is a vocal Clinton supporter and reportedly went so far as to volunteer to play Trump in her mock debates. He said earlier this week that the Clinton team never returned his email offer, but they did keep him in mind for another move. Just got a front row seat to watch @HillaryClinton overwhelm @realDonaldTrump at the ""Humbling at Hofstra"" on Monday. It Is On ! ? Mark Cuban (@mcuban) September 23, 2016 If Cuban is being put in the front row as some kind of psychological ploy, the television audience shouldn't expect to enjoy his presence. Peter Eyre, a senior adviser with the Commission on Presidential Debates, the independent organization that sponsors the events, told ABC News that the live audience will not be on camera during the debate at Hofstra University tonight. There are expected to be about 1,000 people in the audience. The Role of the Moderator Heidi Gutman/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images Lester Holt from NBC's ""Nightly News"" has been tasked with moderating tonight's debate, and he's under some pressure. NBC hosted the recent Commander in Chief Forum, during which both candidates fielded questions about their plans for the military, and Holt's colleague Matt Lauer was widely criticized for his performance. Critics complained that he focused more on Clinton's email scandal than anything to do with the military and that he let Trump make claims that were false without any intervention. The question of how much fact-checking moderators should do during the debates has been raised. Trump has said that he does not believe the moderators should intervene to fact-check, and Clinton raised money off Lauer's lack of fact-checking after the forum, indicating that she would be in favor of moderators' playing a role. The Spin Efforts Afterward It's estimated that tens of millions of people will watch the debate in real time, and many more will be influenced by the social media spin in the aftermath, when the debate about the debate takes place online. Clinton's campaign is well aware that the outcome of the debate depends not just on what the two candidates say onstage but also on the conversation that takes place around it. On a conference call with supporters on Friday, a top aide to Clinton directly asked their supporters to use social media during and after the debate to help shape the conversation positively around the Democratic nominee. The campaign's digital director, Jenna Lowenstein, said two of the campaign's goals for the night are to amplify Clinton's best moments online and to influence the narrative about who is winning. ""It's important that we're not just turning this into the Donald Trump show,"" Lowenstein said. She instructed, ""Tweet early, tweet her name, use those hashtags.""

" NBA legend and fearless columnist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar just debunked the central pillar of the Trump campaign of fear, racism and religious intolerance as un-American fearmongering with a historical parallel every by oneAmerica greatest Presidents which each and every Democratic voter needs to know: Most Americans are familiar with Franklin DelanoRoosevelt famous 1933 ?the only thing we have to fear is fear itself? inaugural address. But the full quote was an even starker warning: ?Let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself ? nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.? Fear, Roosevelt said, causes us to retreat from our duty rather than advance our causes. This year, we are in danger of retreating from building the Americawe all supposed to be proud of, one that protects all and offers equal opportunity to all. The fact that the fear that sends some of us scuttling away is unreasoningand unjustifiedmakes us cowards. Cowards abandon principles at the first sign of danger and look for witches to burn ? or foreigners to blame. Ifthere one stunning thing about the 2016 general election,it the total abandonment of the American experiment by the Republican Party in exchange for the mindless rhetoric of terror and obedience. Normal American politicians ask people to put their faith in our country and its institutions, but Trump told the Republican Convention this year that he alone could solveAmerica problems ? which is the boldest, least believable, total gospel to his supporters.Trump fearmongering on national television starting last year, coincided with a rapid escalation in hate crimes against Muslims over their religious freedom according to Abdul-Jabbar. In fact, 2015 was the worst year to be Muslim in America since 2001, which university researchers in California speculatively attribute to the ?Trump effect.? However, Kareem Abdul-Jabbarisn just one of theNBA legends, nor is he just a columnist whose clarity of insight and strength of voice continues to grow as he opines on the American experience. Kareem is a peer of Donald Trump who grew up in New York City at the same time, but with regular parents and without the trappings of lots of cash, a rich daddy and enough taxpayer subsidy cash to build a sports arena.That why he nailed something essential about the Republicannominee fragile psyche:Trump method for convincing people to go along with doing what they know is fundamentally anti-American ? and just plain evil ? involves scaring voters with a constant barrage of lies and exaggerations. The fact that this propaganda is so effective is especially sad, because the nation that once stood up to bullies like Hitler, Castro and Khrushchev is now falling into goose-step behind a home-grown bully who seems afraid of everything thatisn part of his entitled life, who responds to his irrational fears the way a child does. Kareem called outTrump fearmongering for what it truly is, the reaction of a child who never truly became a man above the shoulders. The Republican never had to grow up, to sink or swim, to stumble and fall and keep working until you make it or not. When Donald Trump plunged his casinos into what would be their first of many bankruptcies, he was put on an allowance by the banks. Let that sink in ? a 40-year-old person, purportedly a grown up, who needs to be kept on an allowance . Who paid that allowance? The many big banks Trump claims to despise today. Worse, they delivered Trump a reward for failure was afterhe wrecked the fortunes of not only his investors, but also the many small business people who never got paid for building his maniacal Taj Majal. Trump ultimately wrecked Atlantic City itself, whose casino industry never recovered fromTrump foolishly ego driven business plans that all of his contemporaries derided as lunacy. Trump can only sell fear, because under the suit, under the fancy airplane, which hewouldn have today withoutdaddy money and connections, under it all,he only got the emotional maturity of a spoiled child. A spoiled child who in the finest Republican tradition like George W. Bush before him has always failed upwards. Now, Trump wants to bring back the last failed Republicanregime worst ideas in spades, along with racism, openly visceral discrimination and a new kind of fear America has never seen. After 9/11 the Bush administration openly used fear to manipulate the public and government policy to help their cronies. Trump wants to use the same fear mongering, but without any actual problems happening. Shamefully, too many Americans are ready to buy into this new Republic of Fear, but as Kareem Abdul Jabbar concluded: ?Compassion and courage are what makes America great, not hate and fear.?

" The police officer who shot unarmed motorist Terence Crutcher has been charged with first-degree manslaughter and a warrant has been issued for her arrest. Crutcher had been driving home from community college when his SUV broke down. Officer Betty Shelby, who has a past history of domestic violence and drug abuse, was on her way to answer a domestic dispute when she encountered Crutcher and the SUV. She stopped, initiated the confrontation with Crutcher, and shot him dead, even though he clearly has his hands up and was unarmed. Her radio communications show that she called him a ?bad dude? even though there was no reason to do so. While the charges are a good sign that justice will be carried out, we must remember that not a single police officer was convicted of unlawfully killing a civilian last year. Nor were any convicted in 2014. Since 2005, only thirteen cops have been brought to justice for executing civilians. ?Juries and judges seem reluctant to second-guess the split-second life or death decisions of police officers in violent street encounters in the course of their job ? and will give the benefit of every doubt to an officer on trial in these cases? says criminology professor Phillip Stintson.We appreciate it if they began to give the people they ostensibly are ?protecting and serving? the same benefit of the doubt.

"""He didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about,"" Donald Trump said about Lester Holt. | Getty Post-debate, Trump team hits moderator Holt for 'some hostile questions' Donald Trump and his campaign complained Tuesday morning that debate moderator Lester Holt targeted him for unfair questioning while neglecting to ask Hillary Clinton about any of her various scandals. ?They were leaving all of her little goodies out. They didn't ask her about, you know, much,? Trump said on FoxNews ?Fox and Friends.? ?But I was asked about my tax returns, which I've told about 500 times. But, you know, I think I did ? I think I really did well when we were asked normal questions. I think I did really well in answering those questions, but those questions are not answerable in a positive light.? Story Continued Below Still, Trump was upbeat overall about the debate, which he said ?went really well? despite ?some hostile questions.? The Manhattan billionaire gave Holt a C+ for his performance as moderator, praising him for his issue-based questions in the first 45 minutes of the debate but attacking him as biased for a series of more direct questions about a housing discrimination lawsuit filed againstTrump real estate company in the 1970s, even though it was Clinton who brought up the Justice Department lawsuit. ?Ididn think he did a bad job. You know, when you look at it, you watch the last four questions, he hit me on birther, he hit he on a housing deal from many years ago that I settled with no recourse and no guilt. He asked me about that,? Trump said. ?That's a beauty to be asked, you know, 40-year-old lawsuit, or older. I just hate to sayit older because thenyou know, then [Fox News anchor Ainsley Earhardt] will say ??Wow Ididn know Trump was that old.? Hey,she be unimpressed.? ?Well, he didn't ask her about the emails at all. He didn't ask her about her scandals. He didn't ask her about the Benghazi deal that she destroyed,? he said. ?He didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. I mean, you know, there's no question about it. He didn't ask about her foundation.? Attacking Holt became a running theme from Trump's campaign Tuesday morning, as both his running mate and campaign manager took to the morning shows to criticize the moderator. ""I was disappointed that Lester did not get into some of the issues that had been in so much of the forefront of HillaryClinton candidacy ? the FBI investigation, pay to play, the whole disastrous events that took place in Benghazi and Libya ? that never came up,"" GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence said on Good Morning America. Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway took a similar line, saying on CNN Tuesday that there were topics she wished Holt would have raised. ?I just would have liked to have heard more about Benghazi or e-mails or the Clinton foundation since these are very clearly in the news,"" she said. ""You know, one of our guests last night was Mark Geist, not Mark Cuban, Mark Geist, who's a Benghazi hero and survivor. And You know, he was within several feet or yards of them and I think it's a good reminder to be Americans of what her record is on that particular issue."" While the Republican nominee insisted that he had outperformed Clinton at the debate, he said that he struggled throughout the night with a defective microphone that made him difficult to hear for the audience in the debate hall. Trump suggested that perhaps his microphone, which he said worked perfectly earlier in the day, had been tampered with. ?I had a problem with a microphone that didn't work. Idon know if you saw that in the room, but my microphone was terrible. I wonder, was it set up that way on purpose,? he said. ?My microphone, in the room they couldn't hear me, you know, it was going on and off. Which isn't exactly great. I wonder if it was set up that way, but it was terrible.? Asked if Clinton had successfully managed to get under his skin during their 90-minute back-and-forth, Trump said she had not until the end of the debate, when the former secretary of state brought up Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado, who Trump called ?Miss Piggy? and ?Miss Housekeeping? because of her Latin heritage. Addressing Trump directly about the name-calling, Clinton said, ?Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a US citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November."" ?I know that person, that person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible, and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe,? he said. ?She was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl.

""People will today make what they want of anything and they see the worst in everything and they look for subtext that doesn't exist,"" Trump told reporters after a fundraiser here.

A top aide to Hillary Clinton called it ""disgusting"" and Clinton supporters attacking the comparison as crass and inhumane.

"Story highlights Critics of the military deal complained it could drag the U.S. into the Saudi-led war The measure to disapprove the sale failed on a 26-71 vote Washington (CNN) The Senate Wednesday rejected a bipartisan proposal to block a pending $1.15 billion United States arms sale to Saudi Arabia. Critics of the military deal, which was approved by the Obama administration last month, complained it could drag the US into the Saudi-led war in Yemen and contribute to the worsening humanitarian crisis there. The measure to disapprove the sale failed on a 26-71 vote. The outcome, which was a victory for Saudi Arabia, came as the US-Saudi relationship is being carefully examined and managed by restive lawmakers. Congress will vote in the coming days in favor of another highly sensitive matter the Saudis strongly oppose. Lawmakers are expected to override President Barack Obama's veto of a bill that would allow victims and families of the 9/11 terrorist strikes to sue Saudi Arabia for its alleged role in them.

"Bernie Sanders has been a mayor, a congressman, a senator and an almost-upset presidential nominee. Soon he'll add ""young adult nonfiction author"" to that resume. Sanders' next book, ""Our Revolution,"" is being adapted for teenagers and being pitched to booksellers as a high school graduation gift. The young adult version of the book, which is not yet titled, will come out in April 2017, according to the publisher, Henry Holt Books for Young Readers. The publisher shared details about the book project with CNNMoney on Wednesday. Policy-oriented books are de rigueur for politicians. But they're usually written for adult readers and read only by devoted supporters and policy wonks. Sanders is doing something unusual by targeting the teenage market. The book will be written for 12- to 18-year-olds. The list price will be $17, $10 less than the edition for adults. Sanders' interest in reaching young readers is in line with his recent bid for president, which tapped into a deep well of support from young voters. Since conceding the Democratic nomination to Hillary Clinton, and endorsing her in the presidential race, he has spoken at length about the importance of motivating young people to care about the electoral process. He recently told The Nation that Democrats have got to open the door to young people."" The party needs to ""[w]elcome them in and understand that it will be messy, that many young people are not professional politicians,"" he said. ""The Democratic Party is going to have to adjust itself to their reality, rather than force young people to be adjusted to the Democratic leadership's reality."" Sanders is currently wrapping up ""Our Revolution,"" which will come out on November 15, one week after Election Day. It is being published by Thomas Dunne Books. Both that imprint and Henry Holt are owned by Macmillan. The young adult edition will follow five months later. Henry Holt describes it as ""an inspiring teen guide to engaging with and shaping the world ? a perfect gift and important read.""",0.012396694,0.004132231,0.008264463,0.004132231,0.037190083,0.214876033,0.004132231,2,-1,1
"I was a Democrat all my life. I came to Washington to serve President John Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy. When the president was murdered and his brother struck off on his own, I joined his Senate campaign and staff as his legislative assistant and speechwriter, until his presidential campaign ended with his own assassination. I ran on a (losing) Democratic ticket in the New York state elections of 1970. When I was working to enact my own program of police reform in the 1980s and 1990s, then-Governor Bill Clinton was chairman of my National Committee for the Police Corps. This year, I will vote to elect Donald Trump as president of the United States. Story Continued Below So profound a change, and a decent respect for old friendships, requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decision. Here it is. John and Robert Kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace. To them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life. Buttoday Democrats have become the Party of War: a home for arms merchants, mercenaries, academic war planners, lobbyists for every foreign intervention, promoters of color revolutions, failed generals, exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments. We have American military bases in 80 countries, and there are now American military personnel on the ground in about 130 countries, a remarkable achievement since there are only 192 recognized countries. Generals and admirals announce our national policies. Theater commanders are our principal ambassadors. Our first answer to trouble or opposition of any kind seems always to be a military movement or action. Nor has the Democratic Party candidate for president this year, Hillary Clinton, sought peace. Instead she has pushed America into successive invasions, successive efforts at ?regime change.? She has sought to prevent Americans from seeking friendship or cooperation with President Vladimir Putin of Russia by characterizing him as ?another Hitler.? She proclaims herself ready to invade Syria immediately after taking the oath of office. Her shadow War Cabinet brims with the architects of war and disaster for the past decades, the neocons who led us to our present pass, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen, in Ukraine, unrepentant of all past errors, ready to resume it all with fresh trillions and fresh blood. And the Democrats she leads seem intent on worsening relations with Russia, for example by sending American warships into the Black Sea, or by introducing nuclear weapons ever closer to Russia itself. In fact, in all the years of the so-called War on Terror, only one potential American president has had the intelligence, the vision, the sheer sanity to see that America cannot fight the entire world at once; who sees thatAmerica natural and necessary allies in this fight must include the advanced and civilized nations that are most exposed and experienced in their own terror wars, and have the requisite military power and willingness to use it. Only one American candidate has pointed out how senseless it is to seek confrontation with Russia and China, at the same time that we are trying to suppress the very jihadist movements that they also are attacking. That candidate is Donald Trump. Throughout this campaign, he has said that as president, he would quickly sit down with President Putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations, and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists. On this ground alone, he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors, earlier in the primaries and now in the general election. It must also be said: Mr. Trump is an imperfect candidate, and he would surely be an imperfect president. He is crude, often vulgar. He has areas of great ignorance. He insults people and inflicts unnecessary harm. He would be twice the candidate he is if he used half the words. He is often intemperate; though it is not Trump but his opponent who is so intemperate as to comparePutin moves in Ukraine to what Hitlerdid insult that throughout all the Cold War and to this day, no American president has ever offered to any Soviet or Russian leader, not even the enormous butcher Josef Stalin, with whom in fact we joined to win the Second World War. And it is not Mr. Trump but Michael Morell, a former CIA director now high in the councils of the Democratic candidate, who has publicly suggested, without rebuke from anyone, that we should begin ?killing Russians,? a doubly illegal act of war. Moreover Trump marks himself as a man of singular political courage, willing to defy the hysteria of the Washington war hawks, the establishment and the mainstream media who daily describe him as virtually anti-American for daring to voice ideas and opinions at variance with their one-note devotion to war. *** John Kennedy admired political courage. He began his first campaign for Congress at the height of the Cold War by saying, ?Above all, day and night, with every ounce of ingenuity and industry we possess, we must work for peace. We must not have another war.? Years later, in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, he and his brother had to overcome great opposition from their own military commanders, government officials and other public leaders, to prevent a war with the Soviet Union: there were 13 men in the ExComm room, and Robert Kennedy said that had any 1 of 8 of them been president, the crisis would have exploded in nuclear war. But within a year thereafter, deeply affected by the barely-averted catastrophe, President Kennedy had forged a close working relationship with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, spoke all over the country to promote peace policies, and delivered his historic American University speech of 1963. Our ?strategy of peace,? he said, was ?not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war.? Rather it must be founded on negotiation, cooperation in areas of mutual interest, and recognition that ?our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish ourchildren future. And we are all mortal.? As to our great adversary the Soviet Union, he said, ?we must reexamine our ownattitude individuals and as anation our attitude is as essential as theirs.? Six months later he was dead; and it was Robert Kennedy who must resume the effort. Robert Kennedy made ratification of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty the early centerpiece of his Senate career. But as President Lyndon Johnson escalated the war in Vietnam, it was that war which forced Robert Kennedy to make his doomed race for the presidency. Wherever he campaigned in 1968, to virtually every audience, he spoke of the loss, the horror, the infinite tragedy of that war, in words that could be and must be repeated today, after 15 consecutive years of wars all over the world. ?Our brave young men,? he said, ?are dying in the swamps of Southeast Asia. Which of them might have written a poem? Which of them might have cured cancer? Which of them might have played in a World Series or given us the gift of laughter from the stage or helped build a bridge or a university? Which of them would have taught a child to read? It is our responsibility to let these men live ... It is indecent if they die because of the empty vanity of their country.? He also urged that we consider the Vietnamese mother, desperately trying to shield her baby from the fire from the sky, sent by machines from a country she could barely understand. He demanded of his colleagues, on the Senate floor, to answer what gave us the right to destroy remote villages on the other side of the world, to arrogate to ourselves the power of God, the rule of life and death over others. ?All this is our responsibility,? he said, ?not just anation responsibility but yours and mine.? John and Robert Kennedy were no pacifists, nor ignorant of the realities of power. But they required that great power be used with great precision and restraint, and with humility. Both knew that their own lives were hostage to the possibility of assassination, yet they kept trying to guide us toward peace up to the moments of their death. The legacy of JFK & RFK is ?being abandoned bytoday Democratic Party.? Theirs is the legacy that is being abandoned bytoday Democratic Party. We have broken one Middle Eastern nation after another. Hundreds of cities and villages lie in ruins, hundreds of thousands are dead, millions are refugees; and, for all the press and political thundering against the menace of ISIS, Al Qaeda, or Islamic terrorism generally, our military leaders offer no prospects of victory. They cannot tell us what victory would require or mean; though they are quick to assure us, as in Libya today, that this conflict will go on indefinitely. They cannot even explain how some of our current allies (example Turkey) are bombing and shelling others of our purported allies (example the Kurds). So a Democratic administration, carrying on the work of the Bush presidency, without thought and without question, year after year, has kept sending more young men and women into the grinder. Scores of Democratic elected officials once spoke and worked tirelessly to end our disastrous war in Vietnam. Today there is only the voice of the marvelous Democratic member of Congress Tulsi Gabbard, a reservist who has twice deployed to Iraq and knows of what she speaks. And it is a Democratic president who sends an endless parade of drones to nations all over the world, flaunting for all to seeAmerica unique military technology, coupled with our seeming complete carelessness in how that technological prowess destroys people and nations. Most amazing of all, however, is that as we proclaim that the terrorists threaten Europe, threaten the United States, threaten Western civilizationitself we face all this, we do not concentrate our military might against this unique threat. Where are we sending our warriors, our ships, our planes? Why to Russia, which the U.S. general who commands NATO has announced is the prime existentialthreat to America. As you read this, ground, air and naval forces of NATO, led and largely paid for by the United States, have been moving about the Western borders of Russia, carrying out the largest military maneuvers since World War II. At the same time, our most powerful carriers and naval air forces have been steaming about the South China Sea, there perhaps to find encounters of unknowable potential with the rising forces of China, our second said to be existentialenemy. There are no Russian terrorists ravaging France or Italy or America. ISIS is not to be found on Russian soil. The only Russian terrorists who have attacked the West are the Islamists whom President Putin first asked us to join in the fight against in 1999. The only Chinese terrorists are Uighurs who are attacking not us but China itself. It would seem elementary common sense that America would have long since sought, not to fight with Russia and China, but to cooperate with both to suppress the terrorists and the terrorism that have plagued us for over a generation, including the ISIS that is terrorizing Europe today. Former Defense Secretary William Perry, a Democrat, warns that we are now, today, ?on the threshold of a new Cold War. ... a new nuclear arms race. ... the likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe is actually greater than it was during the Cold War.? Surely the wars and threats of war already on our horizon would be more than enough for any empire; and our empire, as every thoughtful person knows, is already staggering under the immeasurable loads of debt piled up by America, by our governments, our corporations, our households, our students, and our promises of unlimited benefits in the future. The years of constant combat have exhausted our military. False hopes and vain promises of victory have burnt up the caches of idealism and patriotic commitment with which we began the wars a generation ago. Our forces are worn out, especially the elite warrior units that have been constantly deployed for more than a decade. But, ominously, there is more to come, more that already stares us in the face. The dire events of this summer have shown us the true danger that lurks here at home. This is not a danger imported from Syria or Iraq or Russia. Our greatest menace is the danger of our own history, our inheritance to the latest day. For the fact is that while we chased a chimera of peace and justice in lands far from our own, imposing ourselves and our concepts on strangers who rejected our teachings, we were neglecting our own country and our own people, our own neighbors, our own children and our own friends. And now we can see the result. The violence we took to other countries bounces back to our own. The money we squandered on bombs in Iraq was not available for our own schools. The brilliant young men and women, who gave up their bodies and their lives on distant battlefields, were not here to teach and mentor and guide the young people of the ghetto. They were not here to police the mean streets, to suppress and eliminate the crime that is the greatest cause of poverty. They were not here to bring the protection and the blessings of the American Constitution to the least among us. They were not here to protect American cities and enrich American lives. And they were not here to keep Americans and American children from murdering American police officers. This is our true present danger. *** So my hope for America is this. First, we must begin immediately to end our involvement in endless, unnecessary and therefore murderous wars. We need our best young people to help us here at home. We need to stop the reckless military spending on more destructive armaments. We need to breathe free again. We must and will defend civilized order against its deadly enemies. ISIS and its brethren must be eliminated: no quarter, no hesitation. But we will need to engage all civilized peoples in our mutual defense. We must abandon foolish skirmishes and petty jealousies. We must end our reflexive efforts to dominate other developed nations, especially Russia and China. President Kennedy told us over and over that our own peace and security, in this dangerous world, would depend upon peaceful and cooperative relations with Russia and the Russian people; indeed, at the end of his presidency, Ronald Reagan said the same. Fools in Washington, intent on world domination, would have us ignore that wisdom now. But it is the wisdom that we need to preserve the world and ourchildren future. Second, we must at the same time begin to recover our domestic peace. There are many ills to be cured, many shortcomings to be righted. But nothing can be accomplished in the midst of a war against police, an insurrection against the Constitution itself. Our clear priority is reinforcement of our police and police departments. We need many more and better police. We need them to be better trained, not as warriors but as shepherds, as leaders and teachers of the young, as peacemakers in communities that have not known real peace for many years. We need our very best young people, not getting their legs blown off by IEDs in Afghanistan, but saving all of our lives in St. Louis and Chicago and Detroit and Baton Rouge and all the other wasted places in our own land. Donald Trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying, ?America first.? But to demand that all the actions of government, at home or abroad, be first directed at the interests and well-being of our own country is not old-fashioned or outmoded. Rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of American statesmen from the founders on. Only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens, and a full commitment to those interests, can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond. Finally, our president has told us we must lower our voices. Of course we do not hope for domestic discord. But the people of the United States have perhaps stood silent for too long. The elites of opinion and government have not hesitated to offer us instruction, from the heights of their power and eminence. These are the people who have led us into useless foreign war and limitless domestic disaster. This president tells us that we must now spend another trillion dollars on new nuclear weapons systems, and when we ask who will be the target for these world-destroying weapons, says only, ?There can be no business as usual with Russia.? Surely he must have misspoken, for anyone can see we are on a course of madness. We simply cannot fight the entire world, Russia and China and all the nations of the Mideast, and fight a war at home all at the same time. And therefore we citizens must not be silent, we must speak as with one great overwhelming voice, a voice as powerful as Washington, as Jefferson, as Lincoln, as Martin Luther King: Return to the wisdom of the founders, who fought necessary wars to defend the Union, but sought no foreign conquests. Do not step over the threshold of a new Cold War, a new nuclear arms race with Russia and China, but seek to enlist them in common ventures to resist the forces of terror and chaos that threaten all civilization. Commit to our own domestic peace and security, rather than persist in a vain effort to control the lives and affairs of 200 foreign nations. This, as I understand it, is the platform of Donald Trump. It was not the Republican Party platform, and he had to overcome much opposition within his party to gain the nomination. But it is his platform. It is the platform he has restated again and again, with determination, and with the courage and persistence to outlast his critics. It is a platform that, even in these troubled days, could fulfill the hopes of the greatest Americans of all parties. Well may we seek reassurance whether Mr. Trump has the kind of cool judgment and self-possession that the presidency requires; the judgment that comes to the fore in crisis, that saves a nation or perhaps a world. No one can ever truly know how a future president will react to such enormous pressures. But Trump has given some evidence. He set himself a unique course toward the office, disdaining conventional wisdom, speaking more truth about politics and about America than any conventional consultant or adviser thought prudent or wise. And yet it is his independence, his willingness to name facts however unpleasant, together with his great political courage, that can give us hope and even some confidence that he may be up to the job. Perhaps most important, he has proven that he is not intimidated by the generals and admirals who have up to this day had their unimpeded way with our wars and our budgets, to the immense loss of both. Flawed as he may be, Trump is telling more of the truth than politicians of our day. Most important, he offers a path away from constant war, a path of businesslike accommodation with all reasonable people and nations, concentrating our forces and efforts against the true enemies of civilization. Thus, to dwell on his faults and errors is to evade the great questions of war and peace, life and death for our people and our country. You and I will have to compensate for his deficits of civility, in return for peace, we may hope as Lincoln hoped, among ourselves and with all nations. Truly, America first, last and always; for ourselves and for our posterity. These are the reasons why I will vote for Donald Trump for president.

"Ahmad Khan Rahami is pictured in an undated photo provided by the FBI. | AP Photo 28-year-old man sought in Manhattan blast NEW YORK ? Police released a photo of a 28-year-old immigrant wanted for questioning Monday in bombings that rocked a Manhattan neighborhood and a New Jersey shore town, and New York's governor and mayor said the blasts are looking increasingly like an act of terrorism with a foreign connection. Ahmad Khan Rahami, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Afghanistan with an address in Elizabeth, New Jersey, should be considered armed and dangerous, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in one of a series of TV appearances just minutes after the photo was released. Story Continued Below In addition to the blast in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood on Saturday, a pipe bomb exploded in a New Jersey shore town before a charity 5K race and an unexploded pressure cooker device was found blocks away from the explosion site in Chelsea. On Sunday, five explosive devices were discovered at an Elizabeth train station. New Jersey State Police said Monday, citing the FBI, that the bombings in Chelsea and the New Jersey shore town Seaside Park were connected. No one was injured in the Jersey blast. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said as investigators gathered information they learned there were ""certain commonalities among the bombs,"" leading authorities to believe ""that there was a common group behind the bombs."" ""We want to get this guy in for questioning,"" de Blasio said on CNN. ""We need the facts to be able to piece all this together. ... I think we're going to know a lot more in the course of the day. Things are moving very quickly."" Early Monday, FBI agents swarmed an apartment above a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth that's tied to Rahami. The activity came hours after one of five devices found at the nearby Elizabeth train station exploded while a bomb squad robot attempted to disarm it. No one was injured. Saturday night's blast in the bustling Chelsea neighborhood injured 29 people, and another unexploded device made out of pressure cooker was found several blocks away. In the immediate aftermath of that bombing, de Blasio and Cuomo were careful to say there was no evidence of a link to international terrorism. Both said Monday that appears to be changing. ""The more we learn with each passing hour, is it looks more like terrorism,"" de Blasio said in a later interview on NY1 News. Cuomo, in a separate interview on MSNBC, said: ""Today's information suggests it may be foreign related but we'll see where it goes. ... My operating premise is anytime, anywhere, seven days a week you could have an incident like this."" The White House said President Barack Obama was briefed throughout the night and early Monday on the investigation into bombs found in New York City and New Jersey. Spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama will comment publicly later Monday. On Sunday night, FBI agents in Brooklyn stopped ""a vehicle of interest"" in the investigation of the Manhattan explosion, according to FBI spokeswoman Kelly Langmesser. She wouldn't provide further details, but a government official and a law enforcement official who were briefed on the investigation told The Associated Press that five people in the car were being questioned at an FBI building in Manhattan. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the ongoing investigation. No one has been charged, and the investigation is continuing, Langmesser said. Cuomo, touring the site of Saturday's blast in Chelsea, said the unexploded pressure cooker device appeared ""similar in design"" to the bomb that exploded in Chelsea. On Sunday, a federal law enforcement official said the Chelsea bomb contained a residue of Tannerite, an explosive often used for target practice that can be picked up in many sporting goods stores. The discovery of Tannerite may be important as authorities probe whether the two New York City devices and the pipe bomb at the Jersey shore are connected. Cellphones were discovered at the site of both bombings, but no Tannerite residue was identified in the New Jersey bomb remnants, in which a black powder was detected, said the official, who wasn't authorized to comment on an ongoing investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. The pipe bomb exploded Saturday in Seaside Park, New Jersey, before a charity 5K race to benefit Marines and sailors. The race was canceled and no one was injured. The bombings in New York City and New Jersey happened the same day that a man stabbed and injured nine people at a Minnesota mall before an off-duty police officer fatally shot him. The St. Cloud police chief said the man reportedly made at least one reference to Allah and asked a victim if he or she was Muslim before attacking. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility.",0.044520548,0.008561644,0.006849315,0.017123288,0.075342466,0.27739726,0.015410958999999998,2,-1,1
" It is incredibly difficult to overstate Donald Trump's influence on the 2016 presidential race. Unless, of course, you are Donald Trump. The billionaire building mogul and reality TV-star-turned-Republican nominee has a showman's talent for claiming attention -- and credit for just about anything he wants. For decades now, Trump has made an art of celebrating his lead role, real or imagined, in a laundry list of business and entertainment ventures. His entry into the political world has done little to curtail the habit. Here are a handful of Trump's most outlandish claims: That he pioneered the 'airplane rallies' politicians have used for decades For decades, barnstorming candidates have parked planes, headlined rallies, then flown off to their next stop on the hustings. Trump, too, is fond of pulling up a podium in front of his ""Trump Force One"" 757 jet and speaking to supporters at airfields and in hangars. Clinton did something similar on Monday, holding a brief news conference in front her own plane. A day later, Trump pounced. ""Do people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies(?)"" he asked in a tweet on Tuesday morning. ""She puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning."" Do people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies - she puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning. ? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 20, 2016 But was Clinton really ""copying"" Trump? Mitt Romney, George W. Bush, John Kerry and John McCain (among so many others) might disagree. Even Ronald Reagan used his plane as a prop. In fact, candidates have been using their vehicles of choice (or necessity) as backdrops for campaign rallies for more than 100 years. In 19th and early 20th centuries, though, that usually meant a train and a ""whistlestop"" rally. That he 'finished' birtherism in 2011 Trump took credit last week for having ""finished"" the conspiracy theory he nurtured and promoted for so long. After falsely accusing Clinton of having ""started the birther controversy,"" Trump said: ""I finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean. President Barack Obama was born in the United States -- period."" The basis for the claim? Another dubious assertion, from 2011, when President Barack Obama released his long form birth certificate in an effort to stamp out any remaining sliver of doubt about his birthplace. ""I am really honored frankly to have played such a big role in hopefully, hopefully, getting rid of this issue,"" Trump told reporters then, effectively claiming credit for the President's decision. ""We have to look at (the birth certificate), we have to see is it real, is it proper, what's on it, but I hope it checks out beautifully. I am really proud, I am really honored."" He would spend the next five years perpetuating the smear That he brought the Republican convention to Ohio The timeline tells the story. June 18, 2016: Trump tells Fox News, ""I wanted (the convention) to be in Ohio. I recommended Ohio."" ""I wanted it to be here,"" Trump told Fox's Bill O'Reilly in an interview as the convention got underway. ""And we had lots of choices. I wanted it to be in Ohio. I recommended Ohio."" Factcheck.org looked into the claim and found ""no evidence"" to support it. That he got Hillary Clinton to say 'radical Islamism' After months of being hammered by a variety of Republicans for being too politically correct, Hillary Clinton in June uttered the words ""radical Islamism"" in an interview on CNN's ""New Day."" But the context is relevant: Clinton was responding to a question about the criticism and explaining why she does not use the term regularly or in stump speeches. ""Whether you call it radical jihadism, radical Islamism, I think they mean the same thing,"" she said. ""I am happy to say either. But what I won't do, because I think it is dangerous for our efforts to defeat this threat, is to demonize and demagogue and declare war on an entire religion. That plays right into ISIS' hands."" Undeterred, Trump tweeted his delight -- and took credit for what he described as Clinton's capitulation. ""I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use!,"" he wrote. I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use! ? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 13, 2016 That he was being congratulated for 'being right on Radical Islam' after the Orlando attack Giving new meaning to the term "" Congrats Twitter ,"" Trump on the morning after the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history tweeted his thanks for ""being right"" about the threat of domestic terror. ""Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance,"" he wrote. ""We must be smart!"" Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart! ? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 12, 2016 Trump never specified the source of those congrats and the comment was met with considerable and colorful -- see the responses to the tweet -- online backlash. That he broke 'the glass ceiling' for women On the same night Clinton, who in her 2008 primary concession speech famously lamented that ""we weren't able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling,"" became the first woman in American history to claim the title of presumptive major-party presidential nominee, Trump told Fox News not to discount his own appeal to female voters. After all, he reminded host Bill O'Reilly, ""I was the one that really broke the glass ceiling on behalf of women more than anybody in the construction industry."" Trump has been credited -- by others -- for his hiring practices, but he's also been criticized for a litany of ugly public statements about women in all fields. That he inspired Budweiser to rebrand its beer as America' On May 10, reports first surfaced that Budweiser would temporarily rename its signature product. Instead of simply Budweiser, the beer will for the next few months be called ""America."" The next morning, Trump was asked by ""Fox and Friends"" co-host Steve Doocy if he thought his campaign ""had something to do with"" the decision. ""I think so,"" Trump replied . ""[Budweiser is] so impressed with what our country will become that they decided to do this before the fact."" That he forced Ford's years-old decision to shift some truck production to Ohio In October 2015, Trump declared that ""even my harshest critics gave me credit"" for Ford's decision to ""build a massive plant in the United States."" He also cited his ""constant badgering"" as the impetus for the automaker's scrapped plans for a new one in Mexico. Word is that Ford Motor, because of my constant badgering at packed events, is going to cancel their deal to go to Mexico and stay in U.S. ? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2015 One small problem: the claims were false, according to Ford. ""We decided to move the F-650 and F-750 medium-duty trucks to Ohio Assembly in 2011, long before any candidates announced their intention to run for U.S. president,"" Ford said in response. The construction of a $2.5 billion engine and transmission plant in Mexico is slated to go ahead as planned, the company confirmed. That he aided in the release of Americans in a prisoner swap with Iran When the U.S. and Iran agreed to a prisoner swap in January that brought home, among others, Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian, officials said the agreement came after more than a year of tightly-held negotiations ""accelerated"" by parallel nuclear talks. Trump had other ideas. ""So I've been hitting them hard and I think I might have had something to do with it,"" he said at the South Carolina Tea Party Convention. ""You want to know the truth? It's a part of my staple thing, I mean, I go crazy when I hear about this, you go absolutely wild because how is it possible?"" That he caused planned federal raids on undocumented immigrants In response to the Washington Post's December 2015 report that the Obama administration had signed off on a federal effort to track down and deport undocumented families who had entered the country over the past year, Trump pounced ""Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS,"" he tweeted. ""It's about time!"" Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time! ? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2015 In another tweet, sent less than 24 hours later on Christmas Day, Trump again credited himself for the decision: ""Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!"" Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics! ? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 25, 2015 That he had a role in Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's decision to withdraw his bid for House Speaker In October, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy abandoned his bid to move up a slot and replace John Boehner as speaker. The California congressman's campaign had been hampered by conservative holdouts in the GOP's tea party wing and effectively buried by McCarthy himself when had admitted in an interview that a House Benghazi probe was a vehicle for blunting Hillary Clinton's presidential ambitions. Enter Trump, who at a campaign rally in Las Vegas offered a slightly different narrative ""They're giving me a lot of credit for that because I said you really need someone very, very, tough and very smart,"" he said. ""You know, smart goes with tough. I know tough people that aren't smart. That's the worst. We need smart, we need tough, we need the whole package. JUST WATCHED Trump: McCarthy quit because of me Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: McCarthy quit because of me 03:17 That he alone drove viewers to the first GOP debate The first Republican primary debate, held on Aug. 6 in Cleveland, drew 24 million viewers , a record-breaking figure that a Fox News spokeswoman said made it the highest rated telecast the network's nearly two-decade history. Trump took notice. At a rally a few weeks later, he touted the total, adding ""they normally have like 2 million people"" watching. (Note: the first primary debate four years earlier had 3.2 million.) ""I won't take credit for it,"" Trump told supporters in Iowa, ""but believe me, 100 percent it's me. A hundred percent. It's true. It's true!"" JUST WATCHED Trump: I'll do the debate, but I want $10M for charity Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: I'll do the debate, but I want $10M for charity 01:34 That he denied Jeb Bush the GOP nomination Jeb Bush entered the Republican primary race as the odds-on favorite to follow in his father and brother's footsteps. He exited, on Feb. 20, a defeated man -- or, as Trump explained to the New York Times, a man defeated by Donald Trump. ""I think Jeb would have been the nominee had I not gotten in,"" he said, ""but I was able to define Jeb early."" Indeed, Bush never seemed to come have an answer for Trump's unrelenting, mocking attacks. That he won the 2012 GOP primary in Nevada for Mitt Romney How exactly did Mitt Romney win the Nevada caucuses back in 2012? Donald Trump has an idea. In the aftermath of the eventual nominee's victory, Trump, who endorsed Romney days earlier , chalked up the result... to Trump. ""There was a lot riding on that particular race in Nevada and it was interesting, because the numbers were much, much greater than you thought,"" Trump said during a chat with ""Fox and Friends."" ""And a lot of people are giving me credit for that. And I will accept that credit. Always accept credit."" That he made Lady Gaga a star In his 2011 book, ""Time to Get Tough: Make America Great Again!,"" Trump took a bow for helping to launch the pop star's soaring celebrity.",0.024984765,0.0054844609999999995,0.002437538,0.009750152,0.04631322400000001,0.25289457600000004,0.010968921000000001,2,-1,1
"Story highlights Tim Scott said Thursday that stop-and-frisk policing could be ineffective Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has called for bringing back the policing technique (CNN) Sen. Tim Scott said Thursday that instituting stop-and-frisk policing -- like the kind Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has called for -- could be a potential impingement on Constitutional rights, adding that the policy would be ineffective at easing police-community relations. ""The reality of it is that you don't need to violate the Constitution to keep communities safe,"" the Republican South Carolinian told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""The Lead."" ""We're seeing an increase, an improvement, in public life, in quality of life in South Carolina because we learned how to work together.""

"Story highlights Obams reaffirms US commitment to fighting ISIS Obama praised the response from citizens in New York and New Jersey New York (CNN) President Barack Obama worked to calm Americans' jitters Monday after a series of attempts at mass violence, suggesting that yielding to fear amounted to a win for terrorists. During two appearances in New York, Obama praised the swift work of law enforcement authorities looking into duel bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey over the weekend. And he urged Americans to follow the lead of residents here by not submitting to fear. ""I think it is important to remember what terrorists and violent extremists are trying to do. They are trying to hurt innocent people, but they also want to inspire fear in all of us, and disrupt the way we live to undermine our values,"" Obama said. ""We all have a role to play as citizens in making sure that we don't succumb to that fear. And there is no better example of that than the people of New York and New Jersey."" ""Folks around here, you know, they don't get scared. They are tough, they are resilient, they go about their business every single day.

"Last week I wrote an article titled ?DonaldTrump Amazing Week? which must have been incredibly annoying to liberals and ?Never Trumpers? everywhere. Guess what? This past week has been even better for the 2016 Republican nominee for president, the man whose candidacy was considered a vanity exercise a year and a half ago. Well no one is laughing anymore. The latest round of polls shows that the support for the Trump presidency is growing rapidly. The latest Fox News Poll, which was taken from September 11-14, shows Donald Trump polling at 46%, a one-point lead over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at 45%. The LA Times/USC poll taken from September 9-15 shows Trump at 47% with a six-point lead over Clinton at 41%. The gap between the two candidates is also narrowing in the key battleground states. The Suffolk University Poll which was taken from September 12-14 shows Trump at 42%, leading by 3 points with Clinton at 39%. The CNN/ORC poll, which was taken September 7-12 shows Trump with a 4-point lead over Clinton in Florida. Clinton still has about a 3-5 point lead over Trump in other key battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan, but those gaps are getting narrower every day. Other states such as Nevada and New Hampshire which were initially perceived to be likely wins for Clinton have moved to the ?toss up state? category. Donald Trump also continued his efforts to layout his policy framework with the introduction of another signature platform, his childcare plan at a speech in Aston PA, just outside of Philadelphia. Spearheaded by his daughter Ivanka Trump,Trump childcare policy offers something for everyone across the economic spectrum. The plan offers six weeks paid maternity leave to all mothers who do not receive this benefit through their employers. This benefit will be funded by closing gaps in our existing unemployment insurance program. Lower income families will also benefit from theplan offering of childcare rebates through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program up to $1,200 per year. Middle class families will benefit from being able to fully deduct all childcare expense on their tax returns. Families will also have the ability to establish Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) to put money aside tax free for childcare. Low income families will receive a 50% match of the first $1000 deposited per year, generating up to an additional $500 per eligible family per year. DCSAs can be applied to pay for childcare, after school enrichment programs and school choice. Families can also use the funds in a DCSA to care for an elderlyparent expenses including in home nursing and long-term care. Finally,Trump childcare plan provides a tax deduction for stay-at-home parents, effectively eliminating the tax punishment for aparent decision to leave the workforce to be a full time caregiver for child or an elderly parent. Donald Trump followed his childcare policy speech with another economics speech to the Economic Club of New York which includes some of NewYork most powerful movers and shakers in the world of business and finance.Trump excellent week continued with his visit to the Dr. Oz Show where he released a letter from his long term doctor revealing the results of his most recent medical visit and other relevant pieces of his medical history. Other than carrying an extra 15-20 pounds, Trump appears to be in excellent health. Of course,Trump unveiling his medical records on a television show comes on the heels of the recent concerns about HillaryClinton health following her fainting at lastweek September 11 memorial event and the subsequent revelation that she was suffering from pneumonia. Again, only Donald Trump can turn the literal opening of an envelope into an event. Well, it is an event alright particularly if that envelope is opened on The Dr. Oz Show, a program which is reportedly watched by four million viewers daily with a large percentage of female viewers. During the one hour program, the discussion ofTrump health was followed by the appearance of Ivanka Trump who was able to deliver yet another pitch about the newly announced childcare proposal to the aforementioned audience of women. So yes, somehow all this concern about HillaryClinton health and capacity to serve as president has created multiple free publicity events for Donald Trump. Trump followed up the Dr. Oz interview with a visit to the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. During the visit, Trump permitted the late night comedian to do something ?unpresidential?. That is to say, he told Fallon that he could ?mess up his hair?. While most pundits would speculate that the moment was completely pre-planned, the fact that Trump said yesto the display speaks volumes. He demonstrated that he has the ability to laugh at himself and that he is not afraid to have a bad picture taken. Furthermore, The Tonight Show is popular with Democrats and millennials of all political persuasions. Once again, Trump had an opportunity to make a connection with millions of people who more than likely were not on the ?Trump Train?. Oh and one more thing, by letting Jimmy Fallon touch his hair on national television, Trump has finally set to rest all rumors that his hair is not his. However small,it another check mark in the honesty and transparency box. Now if all of this was not enough, Donald Trump capped his week off with an opening event ceremony at his new hotel in the former post office site in Washington DC where he received endorsements from military flag officers and fourteen Medal of Honor recipients. Trump used the event to not only promote his hotel project as being completed ?two years early and under budget?, a metaphor for how he would manage the US economy, he also seized the moment to put an end to the ?birther issue?. Trump took the microphone and said ?Not to mention her in the same breath,? (as the Medal of Honor recipients who had just endorsed him) ?Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it,? he said. ?President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.? Trump said.

" Once again, Donald Trump and the RepublicanParty fear-mongering about immigrants is proven false. Ever since an improvised explosive device injured 29 in Chelsea, New York City, Trump and his goons have revived one of their favorite talking points ? vilifying Syrian refugees. ?These attacks and many others were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country? yelled Trump at one of his notorious hate-rallies on September 19th. He later went on FOX News and in one broad stroke, painted all immigrants with outrageous hyperbole: ?Think of it, Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands of these same people that are, you know, they have such hatred and sickness in their heart.It sickness, andit hatred, and she wants to allow hundreds of thousands more to come in.? In fact, Mr. Trump, the truth is the bombing was committed by a naturalized American citizen ? and authorities caught the suspect thanks to a Sikh immigrant, Harinder Bains. He is the owner of the bar in whose doorway Ahmad Rahami decided to take a nap in. When Bains saw theman face on CNN, he did what any responsible citizen would do. He called the cops. ?I did what I think every American would have done. My neighbor would have done the same thing. Any Jewish, Christian, Sikh, Muslim. Anybody would have done the samething?m from Sikh faith.I been taught always stand up against the atrocities, any kind of persecution? said Bains toCNN Chris Cuomo.He absolutely right ? because our nation is a nation of immigrants. All of our forefathers are immigrants who colonized this land and committed genocide against the native peoples. Nobody has any more or less of a right to be here than everyone else, and picking on Syrian refugees becausethey Muslims fleeing chlorine gas and barrel bombs is the lowest of the low. Our nation has accepted ten thousand refugees from Syria, a paltry number of the 4.6 milion Syrians that have been displaced by the horrifying violence of the Syrian Civil War. None of them have been connected to any domestic terrorist attacks in the United States. The chance of being killed by a refugee in a terrorist attack is 1 in 3.6 billion; you are at much more danger from your own countrymen and their firearms. Mr. Bains? actions reaffirm the notion that unity and welcome are our greatest assets. When immigrants feel accepted by a community, it becomes their community and they will work just as hard to defend it as anyone would. For instance, the Orlando shooter was reported to the FBI by an immigrant at his local mosque after he discovered evidence ofMateen radicalization; racist Trump supporters repaid him by burning his house of worship to the ground. Mr. Trump and hiscampaign racist rhetoric only serves to drive us apart and puts us in more danger. He is the real threat to America ? not refugee or immigrants.

" A few days ago, DonaldTrump despicable spawn tweeted out a meme comparing refugees fleeing chlorine gas and napalm in Syria to ?poisoned Skittles,? implying that allowing them to resettle in the United States would lead to increased terrorist attacks. Donald TrumpJr meme is referencing an idea with a long history in white supremacist and neo-Nazi thinking and is nothing but a heartless Islamophobic attack against innocent people fleeing an unimaginable hell on earth. Over the past week, hundreds have perished as Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and his Russian allies rain hellfire upon the city of Alepp. Over half a million have perished inSyria civil war. Hundreds of thousands of people in cities across Syria are starving, trapped in besieged cities with no way to get fresh food. Hospitals, markets, schools are bombed indiscriminately. Rebel-held areas are dominated by jihadi groups that institute harsh religious law; in regime areas, tens of thousands vanish into the depths ofAssad prisons to be raped, tortured, and eventually killed. The people of Syria need our help. The conflict is of our making thanks to George W.Bush invasion of Iraq; our refusal to hold the Assad regime accountable for his crimes means we contribute to the slaughter being perpetrated every day. Comedian Eli Bosnick gave an incredibly powerful explanation for just why the Skittles meme is so offensive ? and how we should really feel about accepting refugees.That what real courage looks like.

"John McCain has made 3 million voter contacts in Arizona. Rob Portman marshaled 500 college interns to make phone calls and knock on doors in Ohio. And Pat Toomey barnstormed 26 Pennsylvania counties this summer in a bus plastered with the words ?security, prosperity, independence.? Thenthere Richard Burr. Story Continued Below Republicans are privately fretting that the laid-back Burrisn campaigning aggressively enough for his third Senate term and potentially risking a GOP seat that the party should otherwise have in the bag. But ? in his usual easygoing form ? Burr brushed off any concerns about national Democrats spending at least $6.7 million to unseat him ? a forceful play to make a red-leaning state competitive less than two months before the election. ?It?s great. I think anytime they waste money it saves my colleagues from having it go after them,? Burr smirked when asked of Democrats? money blitz. ?Am I complaining that the last [Quinnipiac] poll had me up 6? No!I probably in better shape than we dreamed.? The Senate Intelligence chairman risks getting caught flat-footed against a relatively unknown opponent in North Carolina, which has become a major target for Democrats eyeing the White House, Senate and thegovernor mansion in Raleigh. But Burr comes by his laid-back attitude honestly ? quirks and all. Hedoesn wear socks, except on certain Thursdays.He bring his own lunch to caucus meetings to save a few bucks on the catered food and sometimes walks around the Capitol chowing on grits. And he drives a ramshackle convertible Volkswagen Thing in rain, sun and snow despite the inoperable roof, leaving it in areas that could not even under the most charitable definition be called a parking spot. The car is covered with bumper stickers, including one supporting conservative Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. ?The best way to describe Richard is to look at the car he drives,? said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a longtime friend. ?He?s a workhorse, not a show horse. If youdon believe me go look at his car. Which is a piece of crap.? But no matter how well-liked Burr is,he in a competitive race against Democrat Deborah Ross, a former state representative who has sneaked up on Burr and trails by about 3 points according to averages of recent polls. And national Democrats are going after him because Ohio has essentially been conceded to the Republicans, Florida is exceedingly expensive and they are searching for any path to the majority. The race is viewed as an essential piece of eitherparty majority: if Democratscan take advantage ofBurr vulnerability, party honchos will kick themselves for leaving a winnable seat on the table. And if Republicans were to lose in North Carolina, it would presage a bad night for them on Nov. 8. Plus, thestate environment is rapidly deteriorating around Burr. GOP Gov. Pat McCrory appears the most vulnerable incumbent governor, Donald Trump is being badly outspent by Hillary Clinton and theGOP so-called bathroom law is now denying the state prized NCAA tournament events. Burr again declined to take a position on the controversial law, known as HB2, last week. ?The state is on fire,? Ross said in a telephone interview. ?North Carolina has the most statewide races that are the closest in the entire country right now.? The political landscape is threatening enough, but GOP insiders say Burr has exacerbated the problem by never deviating from his lax demeanor. Burr says this is his last political campaign ever -- but Republicans privately sayit hard to tell how much he cares about the outcome. ?In this environment you would prefer to have all of your candidates running terrified, and no one would say that he is doing that,? said one top Republican strategist. ?He?s not working as hard as he should,? added another. Burr attended a Senate Republican fundraiser on Sea Island, Ga., as his colleagues spent the past weekend campaigning. Burr ?should have been in North Carolina,? said a third Republican strategist. The senator himself said that national Republicansdon understand his strategy. His aides said he did 26 events in the first three weeks of August, though at one of them he told The Associated Press that hedoesn become a candidate until the Senate goes on recess in October. Was that a mistake? ?Absolutely not. Has my campaign been running? Yeahit been running. When do I have time to go down and be a candidate?I got a full-time job up here,? Burr said. ?What I was trying to say was, I go out and do Senate business,don come up and ask me campaign questions. BecauseI not a candidate,I doing official business.? The 60-year-old Burr is something of a throwback on Capitol Hill, a longtime friend of former House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) who views politicking a distant second to the daily ins-and-outs of being a powerful Intel chairman. A national sales manager for a lawn equipment distributor before entering politics, Burr ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1992, but won a House seat just two years later and served there for a decade before running for the Senate in 2004. Burr is boosted by the fact thathe well-respected by Democrats ? the biggest diss that Democratic senators can come up with is thathe not well-known in the state. In a September Suffolk poll, Burr was unknown by 13 percent of respondents, but Ross was worse off with 45 percent of them sayingthey never heard of her. Still, he led by 3 points in that survey, and Ross has more room to grow her support. ?The more they see of her, the morethey going to like her,? said one Democratic senator. ?Idon know the state of his campaign, I just knowthere a lot of persuadables in North Carolina.? The most stunning sign of GOP hand-wringing is an $8.1 million ad buy reserved by the Senate Leadership Fund ? more than the group is spending on races in the traditional battlegrounds of Nevada and Pennsylvania. And according to Republican officials, pro-Trump forces have reserved only $3.2 million in ads in the state, while pro-Clinton forces have reserved $21.2 million. Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., talks about his 1974 Volkswagen Thing near the courtyard of Russell Building. | Getty Republicans supporting Burr and the candidate himself, however, have about $20 million in ads scheduled to run this year, compared with about $9 million for Democrats. And Burr has a built-in money advantage, with $7 million on hand to Ross? $2 million at the end of June, and is now up on TV. But Burr has been hampered by another troubling statistic: Ross outraised him the past two quarters, a major accomplishment for a candidate in a first-time race and a troubling one for a longtime politician. Democrats say they have benefited from Ross? obscurity; had former Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) or former Rep. Heath Shuler (D-N.C.) got in the race, Burr may have been startled into an overwhelming show of force early on. But now in the midst of the sprint to November, Ross is in serious contention. ?She?s very good.She very sharp,? said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Jon Tester of Montana. ?The next seven weeks are critical, butshe a great candidate andshe absolutely in the mix. Seven weeks is a long time, but I think that long time helps her a lot.? Republicans read things another way -- that they will use the next seven weeks to stir up inflammatory pieces of Ross? record, which includes running thestate American Civil Liberties Union, opposing a sex-offender registry and efforts to ban flag burning. GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina called her a ?no-compromises ultraliberal? ? and Republicans said after they are done with her, voters will figureshe too left for the red-leaning state. ?That state is competitive. It is a must-win for us,? said National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Roger Wicker (R-Miss.). ?We?re going to spend a lot of money pointing out the shortcomings of Ms. Ross, of which there are many, too numerous to mention for the rest of the [election]. And I know that some of our friends have stated publicly that they intend to do that.? Wicker himself refused to concede that Burrisn working hard enough. And worries about Burr in Washington strategy rooms is nothing new. His first Senate campaign in 2004 was characterized by his lone ranger style as he bombed around the state, often alone, to events, Republicans recounted. By 2010he done little to elevate his stature, yet cruised to reelection as part of the tea party wave with the same relaxed demeanor. ?This happens every six years,? remarked a fourth top GOP operative. This year, though, is different. TheDSCC commitment is a major development in the race; Burr faced essentially no attacks from outside groups in 2010. And the presidential tossup in combination withBurr under-the-radar stature meanshe likely to lose his seat if Clinton bests Trump. Yet Burr is as carefree as ever, moseying through the Capitol halls alone, without aides or talking points to dispense. And sincehe not listening to campaign officials, Republicans have no other solution other than to trust that he knows whathe doing. ?That sometimes makes the experts uneasy,? said Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.).",0.030061892000000003,0.00530504,0.004420866,0.008841733000000001,0.047745357999999995,0.229885057,0.006189213000000001,2,-1,1

"Washington  Most white working-class voters who are evangelical Christians -- like most white evangelicals -- would consider voting for Donald Trump. But it's not because they believe he shares their conservative Christian values. Rather, they agree with him that America is not as great as it once was, according to a new CNN/Kaiser Family Foundation poll. While black evangelicals are solidly against the GOP nominee, among white working-class evangelicals, about three in four -- 76% -- say they'd consider voting for Trump. Partisanship likely plays a big part in this, as half of white working-class evangelical Christians identify as Republicans. The majority -- 6 in 10 -- of voters in this group believe the US' better days are in the past and most are concerned that the country is becoming less Christian. Nearly 90% of working class whites who are evangelical Christians believe Christian values are under attack in America today. While most Christian groups -- 73% of mainline Protestants and 61% of Catholics -- share this view, only 41% of those with no religious preference believe these values are under attack. Trump often says he wants to ""make America great again,"" and working-class whites are a core of his support, but that doesn't mean they don't question the faith of a man who once said he never asks God for forgiveness ""When listening to him, he's not a Christian. He does not have any of the values that we have,"" said Buddy Mitchell, a 47-year-old from Arvada, Colorado, and owner of a flooring company. ""I don't know of any redeeming quality of Donald Trump other than both Democrats and Republicans hate him,"" said Mitchell, who did not participate in the survey. ""That's the only reason I like him: that the establishment doesn't like him."" Christian values seen as under attack That dislike for the establishment is a strong point for Trump with this demographic. For many white working-class evangelicals, it's clear who is at fault for many of the country's issues: the federal government. White working-class evangelicals are also more likely than others to blame the federal government for the economic problems facing the working class. ""I don't think that either candidate is taking Christian values into consideration,"" said Sandra Long, an 80-year-old lifelong Democrat. ""Neither one of them is acting very Christian-like.

Darrell Pool, a 60-year-old from Lamar, Colorado, said he doesn't see his traditional Christian values honored by the leading candidates. ""I don't see my values shaping the election. There's just a lot of mayhem,"" he said. ""I think the values that were in the country's founding are leaving. The moral values are leaving daily."" Many white working-class evangelicals have no confidence that either of the presidential candidates has the ability to return the country to their perception of its former glory. ""I don't know where I am,"" said Long. ""I'm so confused at this point and time. I don't believe either one of them should be in office. I don't believe either one should be running."" Some have entertained third-party candidates. ""I'm sick to my stomach. I cannot stand Hillary (Clinton) and I can't stand Trump, so for the first time in my life, I'm thinking of voting Libertarian or not voting,"" Mitchell said. For these voters, the lack of confidence in government is exemplified in the candidacy of Clinton, who has been in government for more than 20 years. ""If you or I would have done what she did with those emails, we'd be in jail,"" Mitchell said. ""But because she's the Democratic nominee, they don't hold politicians to the same standards that they hold the people."" Many of the standards these voters want to see candidates follow are rooted in the Christian faith. Security also a concern But values aren't the only concerns of these voters. National security is also a major issue to many of these voters, many of whom have personal connections to the military. ""All these refugees they want to bring in, that's really got me going,"" said Pool, who participated in the survey. ""They have no idea who they're bringing in and we just keep having more attacks here."" ""I just think it's ludicrous and all it's for is so one party can have more voters,"" he said. The relationship between evangelicals and the refugee issue is a complicated one. Some of the biggest critics of Trump's proposed Muslim ban have been evangelicals. Christian organizations have been among the most active in helping resettle refugees, but that doesn't mean some among their flock aren't anxious. The majority -- 75% -- of white working-class evangelicals believe that recent immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the US, a higher percentage than other working-class whites. ""I say let's quit bringing these people in, period,"" Pool said. ""I realize America is a melting pot and that's how America started in the first place, but we have a process here. Nobody says you can't come to this country. Come on in. Let's do it the right way.""",0.033430233,0.011627907,0.007267442,0.010174419,0.0625,0.322674419,0.029069767000000003,2,-1,1
" Police brutality has never truly leftAmerica national conversation, but it had taken a back seat to the presidential election circus until video showed Tulsa police shooting and killing Terence Crutcher in cold blood. It was all too much for one small town Ohio police chief, and his moving words have started gone viral on social media according to PINAC News: But Middletown Police Chief Rodney Muterspaw said he could not remain silent after watching Tulsa police officer Betty Shelby shoot and kill Terence Crutcher, tweeting the following message Tuesday, which has been retweeted almost 6,000 times as of this writing. The video showing an Oklahoma cop shoot and kill Terence Crutcher after he had his hands in the air, only to later claim he was not complying, is so outrageous that even an Ohio police chief took to social media to voice his disgust. And that is something we never see. According to local media in his hometown of Middleton, Chief Muterspaw wrote on his Facebook page that if police officers ?can?t do the job or are scared of people different than you, then get out of the job. You are making us all look bad. STOP.? ?It could be us tomorrow,? Muterspaw told the Journal-News. ?You have to look at it.It not second-guessing anybody.It training for us.It a chance to learn from it. We are not robots. We have an opinion too. If it makes our department better and keeps our officers safer, if it makes the city better we should speak out about it.? He said Middletown officers have removed 137 weapons from suspects this year without firing their guns. Then he went onto twitter and fired off a pair of tweets heard round the world.Here theChief two public tweets, which were embedded into PINAC News? story before he took his account private after gaining national attention: The messageisn resonating in Tulsa, where officers have stuck to their hokum story that Terence Crutcher tried to reach into his car window for a gun ? even though a video shows clearly that the window was closed. Now officers are trying to slander Crutcher claiming thatit all a drug related issue, an obvious attempt to discredit their dead victim ? which curiously, theyhadn tried to do until his killing gained national attention. In any case, wedon recall drug posession carrying the death penalty in United States of America, or the suspension of his right to a fair trial. Now Department of Justice officials are going to investigate the Tulsa officer who killed Crutcher, and with any luck field criminal charges against the cop whose story has frequently changed to desperately try and justify her lethal actions. ChiefMuterspaw impassioned call to the professionalism of police, to empathy in their daily life and his commitment to less violent policing is a lesson that one good copwon spoil the bunch. Sadly, this is newsworthy becausehe quite possibly the only high ranking police official in America who is (or was) openly siding with Americans, and siding with citizens right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

"""The West Wing"" creator's storylines are proving remarkably prescient in the epic Donald Trump-Hillary Clinton White House battle. A Democratic campaign grappling with a health crisis? Check. (See Hillary Clinton's pneumonia and Jed Bartlet's far more serious multiple sclerosis). Gaffes by politicians that conveniently help their cause? There, too, this year. A soon-to-be nominee iffy at best about his running mate? That happened on the NBC drama as well. The similarities are poised to cross into reality this weekend when most of the series' cast members will campaign for Hillary Clinton in Ohio. There's a certain irony to this, as many series plotlines about the White House of fictional commander in chief, Bartlet (Martin Sheen), were based on events from Bill Clinton's administration. ""The West Wing"" premiered with about 14 months left in Bill Clinton's presidency, and a swath of his former aides worked on the show as writers and producers. So in the already ""West Wing""-tinged 2016 campaign, what's next in made-for-television events? Five episodes offer clues. Unhealthy secrecy Bartlet is depicted in the series as an exemplar of virtue, both in public and private realms. A Nobel Prize-winning economist and former New Hampshire governor, he earnestly wrestles with public policy decisions based largely on his progressive principles. Bartlet is a devout Catholic and father of three daughters seemingly without hint of personal scandal. But he's not infallible. It's revealed midway in the first season that Bartlet has been hiding a years-ago diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. And he had full complicity from his physician wife Abby (Stockard Channing), who delivered shots of a mitigating drug, betaseron. The secret is so closely-held that the Bartlets initially keep it from the candidate/president's close friend, Leo McGarry (John Spencer) -- who convinced Bartlet to seek the White House in the first place. McGarry is eventually let in on it after the president collapses in the Oval Office. But the trio keeps White House senior staff members in the dark for more than a year. A miniature version of this drama recently played out in the 2016 campaign, although over a considerably less serious medical issue for Clinton. Compared to Bartlet's years-long conspiracy of silence over a potentially life-threatening condition, for only two days she neglected to inform the public about a common health concern, pneumonia, from which she quickly recovered, according to medical information provided by her campaign. Clinton in September was slow to reveal the pneumonia diagnosis, after a spate of coughing fits during a speech and on her campaign plane. And she doesn't appear to have informed many of her top aides about it. Her doctor revealed the candidate's pneumonia diagnosis on the afternoon of Sunday, September 11, through her campaign. But that was two days late, and only after the Democratic nominee stumbled and exited a 9/11 commemoration ceremony early -- in full public view. Many people even inside the Clinton campaign did not know about the pneumonia diagnosis. An aide said that Clinton ""thought she could push through this ... she was feeling better"" -- until that Sunday morning. In both cases, neither politician actually presented false information to the public. ""Nobody lied,"" an exasperated McGarry says tells White House Communications Director Toby Ziegler (Richard Schiff), during one one particularly dramatic ""West Wing"" scene. Political 'gaffes'? Riffing at a campaign fundraiser in New York on September 8, Hillary Clinton veered into seemingly dangerous political territory ""To just be grossly generalistic, you can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables,"" Clinton said. ""Right? Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it."" Clinton then said some of these people were ""irredeemable"" and ""not America."" Predictable outrage soon followed from the Trump campaign and supporters. Clinton -- kind of -- walked it back. ""I regret saying 'half' -- that was wrong,"" she said in a statement in which she also vowed to call out ""bigotry"" in Trump's campaign. The episode seemed like the self-inflicted wound of Clinton's political career. She insulted a broad swath of the electorate, and gave her opponents an opening to play victim of mean-spirited attacks. But her ""deplorables"" jab at Trump voters had another effect -- it put Trump and allies on the defense to show its campaign supporters weren't racist. In doing so, it stirred a lively -- and ongoing -- conversation about some of the more controversial elements of the Trump coalition. In other words, Clinton set the terms of argument -- and potentially helped rally her Democratic base. The incident called to mind a similar Bartlet ""gaffe"" made in the course of a heated presidential race, which ended up helping his cause. In a 2002 episode, Bartlet is caught on camera ""accidentally"" questioning the intelligence of his GOP opponent, Florida Gov. Rob Ritchie. After touting his administration's energy plan, he disparages his rival -- a thinly-veiled George W. Bush stand-in -- as a "".22 caliber mind in a .357 Magnum world."" For days, the Bartlet White House is on the defensive for an unsportsmanlike insult at a campaign rival. But it turns out Bartlet's blunder was anything but. The errant comment triggers waves of coverage about his rival's smarts -- or lack thereof -- while raising awareness about the energy proposal. ""It didn't turn out too bad at all,"" White House Press Secretary C.J. Cregg (Allison Janney) muses to Bartlet in the episode's closing scene. ""In fact, the whole country's talking about whether Ritchie's smart enough to be president. And you didn't take a hit, because it was an accident."" Party crashers When Trump entered the 2016 GOP primary race, he faced a wall of establishment-type pols -- Marco Rubio, John Kasich and many more. He beat them all. Jed Bartlet, too, was an outsider candidate who shocked the political establishment. He started out far behind Texas Sen. John Hoynes (Tim Matheson), but his populist message eventually overtook his Democratic rivals. Bartlet at times shows existential angst over his place in the party firmament. Notably in the Season 2 finale ""Two Cathedrals,"" he ponders whether to run for re-election after a primetime news conference revealing his MS condition, and juggling several crises, foreign and domestic. In a dream sequence with his recently-deceased secretary, a big-sister-like figure for decades, Bartlet observes, ""I've got a secret for you, Mrs. Landingham: I've never been the most popular guy in the Democratic Party."" Trump, though, has shown no such self-reflection. He routinely boasts of beating out 16 GOP primary rivals. As Ms. Landingham predicted would happen for Bartlet and the Democrats, the Republican National Committee and party apparatus have rallied around Trump. You can't always get what you want A recurring ""West Wing"" subplot depicts long-simmering tension between Bartlet and his vice president, the past primary rival. A more conservative Democrat, Hoynes was a one-time favorite for the party nod who ultimately lost to the upstart Granite State challenger. Bartlet put Hoynes on the ticket out of necessity to win Southern states -- a New England-Texas alliance reminiscent of John F. Kennedy tapping Lyndon Johnson as his running mate in 1960. Both odd-couple tickets led to transactional relationships at best. LBJ was famously cut out of Kennedy's inner circle. ""West Wing's"" Hoynes is seen repeating trying to undercut the president. In fact, it's a Hoynes New Hampshire trip that forces Bartlet's hand into revealing the president's MS condition. In 2016, Republican nominee Trump isn't on such fraught terms with his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. Outwardly, they seem cordial enough, with Pence playing the good solider, dutifully defending Trump's many controversial remarks. But it's no love affair, either. In searching for an understudy, Trump over the summer reportedly narrowed his search to three finalists -- Pence, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Trump finally went with Pence. But he was so unenthusiastic about it that the night before the campaign's scheduled announcement he frantically called advisers and friends about how to reverse the decision By that time, Pence was already ensconced in a New York hotel room, with the full expectation that he would be announced as Trump's choice. It was simply too late for a change. But a less-than-subtle signal about Trump's feelings came the next day when he spent a full 30 minutes talking before letting his running mate have a few words at the microphone. The Trump campaign rally theme song that then blared -- ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" by The Rolling Stones -- seemed particularly apt for the moment. The lawsuit election Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state has led to a series of ongoing headaches in her 2016 campaign. While let off the hook by the FBI about whether she improperly dealt with classified material on an unprotected network, conservative critics are still on her case. And one group, Judicial Watch, has drawn a measure of political blood. The group filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the State Department in 2015, and in August, it released 296 pages of emails from the Democratic presidential nominee -- including 44 that Judicial Watch says were not previously handed over to the State Department by Clinton. The emails, many of which are heavily redacted, raise questions about the Clinton Foundation's influence on the State Department and its relations during her tenure. In one instance , top Clinton Foundation official Doug Band lobbied Clinton aides for a job for someone else in the State Department. In the email, Band tells Hillary Clinton's former aides at the department -- Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin -- that it is ""important to take care of (redacted)."" Band is reassured by Abedin that ""Personnel has been sending him options."" The revelations haven't derailed Clinton's campaign -- but they weren't helpful, either. And the documents recall an early ""West Wing"" story arc including a conservative legal group, ""Freedom Watch,"" which forces Bartlet administration senior staff members to testify in depositions about alleged White House drug use. The group's target is McGarry, a recovering drug addict and alcoholic. Freedom Watch obtains supposedly-private records from McGarry's treatment center. It forces McGarry, a former Labor secretary, into an embarrassing public admission. Even during ""West Wing's"" original run, Freedom Watch looked familiar. The fictionalized conservative watchdog group was, not surprisingly, based on Judicial Watch. The real life group has a long history with the Clintons, having filed lawsuits over 1990s-era controversies like the Vince Foster suicide.",0.021167883,0.00729927,0.00729927,0.005109489,0.040875912,0.23795620399999998,0.004379562,2,-1,1
"?The Democrats are insisting upon Flint, and we've got members who are interested in some assistance for flooding in Louisiana,? Sen. John Thune said. | Getty Senate advances budget deal that doesn't exist yet Mitch McConnell summoned his Republican Conference to a late afternoon meeting on Tuesday with an unusual ask: Would his colleagues support moving forward on a spending deal thatdoesn even exist yet? The answer, surprisingly, was yes. Story Continued Below The Senate voted 89-7 on Tuesday evening to move forward on a bill that eventually will be used to fund the government through Dec. 9 and deliver $1.1 billion to fight the Zika epidemic. A bloc of conservatives voted no, but the measure easily cleared the 60-vote threshold to avoid a filibuster, powered by votes from Senate Democrats, centrist Republicans and GOP senators up for reelection. ?We?ve got a lot of work to do around here,? said Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who voted nobecause of concerns over the unorthodox process. Yet enough Republicans supported McConnell on the matter because there are still several opportunities to block the bill later if senators believe they are getting a raw deal in the end, senators said. The majority leader offered a brief update on the state of play to his conference, but the main reason for the meeting was to make sure there was enough support to begin a process that eventually will allow Senate Republicans to go home and campaign for reelection more quickly. ?There are negotiations that are ongoing, and this bill in my view just sets the stage for an agreement that we hope occurs sooner rather than later,? said Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.). Campaign finance, trucking safety and the Internet domain system are among the grab bag of issues keeping the Senate from a final deal to stave off a government shutdown at the end of this month. But the biggest hurdle, Zika, has been resolved without including any language that would block PlannedParenthood partner clinic in Puerto Rico from accessing the federal grants ? a key demand from Democrats. ?We want a clean CR, a clean Zika bill, period,? said Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Senate Democrat. ?We?ll save the debate on the riders for the lame-duck session.? McConnell told reporters the parties were closeto finalizing an agreement Tuesday afternoon, but he said he he would want senators to have some time to consider it before moving forward. And senior Republicans said the Senate was certain to stay in session next week, ensuring that the annual slog over must-pass government spending would ? as in previous years ? go down to the wire. Democrats pin the blame for the delay on the GOP. ?We should have no vexatious, poison-pill riders,? Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said. ?We are not going to have a CR loaded with riders. One is too many, andthat whatthey trying to do.? The Nevada Democrat took particular umbrage at the prospect of continuing a prohibition on the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring public companies to disclose political spending. That provision was included in lastyear omnibus spending bill, but Reid said he will fight to strip it out. ?We?re not going to have this bill [be] a pincushion forMcConnell desire to have nothing, nothing reported dealing with campaign spending,? Reid said. Lawmakers also are clashing over the Obamaadministration plan to relinquish the U.S.government authority over the Internet domain system to an international body on Oct. 1. Republicans led by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune of South Dakota are pushing to continue a prohibition on the handover, which is sharply opposed by the administration. ?It?s just trying to figure out how to structure it, how to do it, how to make it effective,? Thune said of the Internet domain issue, known as ICANN. ?I think in some form, I think that issue has to be addressed.? Republicans said both the SEC language and the Internet battle were still under consideration as of late Tuesday. Cruz voted noon moving forward. A GOP-backed push to block Transportation Department rules regarding how long truckers must rest between drives is among other final issues to be determined. As of late Tuesday afternoon, however, it appeared as though the trucking issue was close to being resolved, according to one source familiar with the negotiations. Congressional negotiators also were continuing to discuss offsets for Zika funding. And it looked increasingly likely that the continuing resolution will not include money to address the lead contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan, or to respond to the devastating flooding in Louisiana. ?The Democrats are insisting upon Flint, andwe got members who are interested in some assistance for flooding in Louisiana,? Thune said. ?Maybe it ends up that neither gets addressed ? Idon know.? Thune also suggested that an administration effort to restore the Export-ImportBank full financing authority was falling short. ?I know that the Dems are very intent on changing that quorum threshold, but even if we could pass it through the Senate ? and Idon know we can ? that makes a very heavy lift in the House.?

"This may be the biggest endorsement that GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump has gotten since the primary season ended. His biggest weakness with voters has long been his perceived lack of experience on foreign policy, which has been exacerbated by the foreign policyestablishment general embrace of Hillary Clinton. While Clinton likely plans to pursue many of BarackObama failed policies abroad, she has generally toed the foreign policy line that the political establishment has been parroting for years. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has taken a different tack on issues dealing with Russia, China, the Middle East, and Latin America. These differences have made it difficult for him to find supporters in the foreign policy community that could help him reassure voters.That no longer a problem. Former CIA Director R. James Woolsey, who was appointed and served under President Bill Clinton, came out this week and announced that he would be joining the Trump campaign and advising Mr. Trump on foreign policy. Woolsey said that he could not support Clinton because of her unwillingness to sacrifice her own self-interests and to safeguard our secrets. ?She demonstrated a complete lack of understanding and an inability to lead the agency she headed in such a way as to maintain its mission and security,? Woolsey said in a statement. ?Based on the emails thus far released we know that Secretary Clinton also lacks the ability to lead her senior managers while complying with and maintaining the basic protocols designed to protect ourgovernment sensitive and classified information. Mr. Trump understands the magnitude of the threats we face and is holding his cards close to the vest.? Later in an interview with CNN, Woolsey citedTrump ability to safeguard our secrets (better than Clinton has) and his budget plans as reasons for throwing his support to Mr. Trump. ?He seems to be, more so than his opponent, in favor of a strong defense budget.We got a lot of space to make up and problems that have been left in defense by the Obama administration.?Woolsey endorsement and advice may go a long way to helping Trump close the foreign policy gap thathe thus far encountered with Hillary Clinton. Also, now that Woolsey has joined the team, one wonders if other foreign policy experts will begin lining up with Trump as well. With the debates around the corner, the Trump team certainly seems to be getting their political affairs in order, whichcan be welcome news for the Clinton campaign.

"While Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump prepare for their first debate on Monday, aides in both their campaigns are expressing concern over how it will all go down. Interested in Elections? Add Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest The Trumpcampaign major concern: thecandidate limited preparation. The Clintoncamp biggest worry: that the Republican presidential nominee will be asked softer questions than Clinton. ?My biggest concern continues to be a low bar set for him on expectations,?Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri told reporters during a flight to Orlando, Florida, today, referring to the debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, on Sept. 26 ? the first of three face-offs between the two White House hopefuls. ?People accommodate the questions and lower the bar on their questions to suit the candidate in front of them, andthatwhat happened with Trump in the past. And they ask Hillary Clinton a set of much harder questions,? Palmieri said. ?They ask him a set of easier questions because he has not put forward detailed ... material you can parry him on.? Her concern stems from what the campaign considers to have been unfair treatment of Clinton during a recent NBC News national security forum that featured both candidates fielding questions from a moderator and audience members in separate segments. Clinton has been preparing for the debate for weeks, and she has no public campaign events planned for the rest of the week so she can continue studying. Aides say the former secretary of state ? who is known for doing her homework ? has been poring over briefing books and practicing in mock debates with a Trump stand-in. She has been studying footage ofTrump past debates. From this, Palmieri said, they believe the Republican nominee tends to do better in multicandidate settings, where he can hang back and pick his moments. The campaign is also concerned aboutTrump unpredictable nature. ?You?re not sure who is going to show up. He may be aggressive or laid back,? Palmieri said. And while it is common for campaigns to lower expectations before debates and other high-profile events, sources told ABC News thatTrump preparation for the 90-minute one-on-one battle has been slim ? so much so that his senior staff has become concerned about his lack of focus. While Trump has boasted that he will winMonday debate, senior sources said he has not delved into policy or participated in mock debates. During his Sunday meetings in Bedminster, New Jersey ? where he huddles with campaign chief Steve Bannon, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, Roger Ailes and other advisers, including members of his family ? the prep has become more of a discussion of topics and themes and not specific in nature. (Those sessions often become storytelling sessions rather than actual, intense preparation, according to senior sources.) Trump, sources said, was given an iPad loaded with footage of old Clinton debates. Unlike Clinton, who is spending almost the entire rest of the week preparing for Monday, Trump has a busy campaign schedule this week, with no large blocks of time carved out for debate prep. Aides said his debate sessions planned for this weekend have been moved to Trump Tower in New York City, away from his Bedminster estate and golf course, to help him focus. The Trump campaign recently added a Saturday evening event in Roanoke, Virginia. ABC News?

"Donald Trump made his comments in a pre-taped interview on Fox News. | Getty Trump calls for nationwide 'stop-and-frisk' policy Donald Trump on Wednesday called for the controversial ?stop-and-frisk? policing practice to be instituted nationwide as a means of combating violent crime inAmerica inner cities. In a pre-taped interview on Fox News scheduled to air Wednesday night, Trump was asked by an audience member what he would do to address ?violence in the black community? and ?black-on-black crime.? Trump responded by proposing that ?stop-and-frisk? policing, in which an officer is empowered to stop an individual and frisk them for weapons or any other illegal contraband, be adopted nationwide.

In New York City it was so incredible, the way it worked. Now, we had a very good mayor, but New York City was incredible, the way that worked, so I think that could be one step you could do.? The practice, carried out most famously in New York but also by other police departments, is frequently criticized as an avenue for officers commit acts of racial profiling.

"With seven weeks until Election Day, Hillary Clinton and her allies are set to outspend Donald Trump and his allies by wide margins during the homestretch. A whopping 95 percent of all campaign television ad spending scheduled between today and Election Day ? more than $143 million worth ? comes fromClinton team, according to an ABC News analysis of CMAG/Kantar Media data. Team Clinton will spend $143.2 million on television ads, versus only $6.8 million for Team Trump. The difference in future spending in key battleground states is even starker ? with Team Clinton slated to spend 53 times as much as Team Trump on television ads in Florida between now and Nov. 8. In Florida, Clinton is spending $36.6 million, versus just under $700,000 for Trump. The differences continue in Ohio ($20.9 million versus $1.8 million), Pennsylvania ($18.8 million versus $1.5 million) and North Carolina ($14.3 million versus $1.3 million.) Those are crucial states forTrump campaign. If he wins all four, he will almost certainly land in the White House. If he loses even one, it will be very difficult for Clinton to lose the general election. Recent polling in these states has shown a tight matchup but a lead for Clinton in Pennsylvania.

But the reality remains that when the joint comprehensive plan of action was passed based on the United Nations Security Council resolution 2231, and it was approved unanimously, that became an international agreement."" Story Continued Below Trump has repeatedly criticized the Iran nuclear deal, calling it a ""bad deal"" and previously said he would tear it up. He's also called the Obama administration incompetent over it. Clinton, on the other hand, has said she would respect the deal, yet be cautious in dealing with Iran, in what's come to be known as her ""distrust and verify"" strategy. ""No one can say here or there that I don't accept this agreement, I want to renegotiate it. This has purely an electoral effect for some,"" Rouhani said.",0.037037037,0.012345678999999998,0.0,0.018518519,0.074074074,0.32716049399999997,0.00617284,2,-1,1
" It only took Seth Meyers ten minutes to blow up the gullible media for broadcasting an hour-long Trump infomercial, willfully spreading more of the Republicannominee outrageous lies and allowing him to twist the narrative and pretend that hehasn been leading the birther movement for the past five years while using the occasion to promote his new hotel. After a half an hour of free advertising, Trump finally tossed the media the bone they were waiting for, a thirty second statement with no apology that FALSELY claimed that Hillary Clinton started the birther movement in the first place. Youdon peddle racist rhetoric for five years and then decide whenit over. We decide whenit over. Andit certainly not over after a thirty second statement in a thirty minute hotel commercial.He right. Donald Trump is a shameless birther, a man who spent half a decade making racist claims about President Obama long past any rational point of interest, questioning thePresident birthplace and religion for the sake of personal attention within the bigot wing of the Republican Party. Anyonena enough to believe that Donald Trumpisn a hate-mongering politician merely must look at that thirty second statement, which was immediately followed by the a concentrated effort by the Trump campaign to gaslight the country and claim innocence while blaming Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. ?I?m not sure the guy who holds fake press conferences, has a fake university, a fake foundation, fake hair, and a fake tan, should be in charge of decidingwhat real!? rips Meyers. Butit a crock of lies, and Seth Meyers called out the Republican nominee for knowingly pulling the hotel commercial stunt which Trump admitted in a tweet. Meyers pointed out that evenCNN anchors thought Donald Trump was full of crap while their infomercial was rolling, but theydidn cut or break away and kept letting the Republican candidate hawk his hotel anyway. Meyers then rips into Trump surrogate and disgraced New Jersey governor Chris Christie for defending Trump while prosecutors are accusing him of orchestrating the ?Bridgegate scandal.?The traditional objectivestyle of coverage withit he said-she said equivalence is not capable of aptly conveying the factual reality of the gushing sewer of falsehoods that is Donald Trump.

"31497 SHARES Facebook Twitter Reddit Stumbleupon PinterestIt the nightmare scenario we hopedoesn happen: On November 8, somewhere around midnight or shortly thereafter, the election returns are finally in from across the nation and it becomes clear that Donald J. Trump is the next President of the United States. But instead of reaching for your passport and booking an extended vacation to another country, consider what University of Utah law professor Christopher L. Peterson had to say in a paper he just published: Even if he were elected,there enough evidence already in the matter of Trump University to impeach the Orange Menace before he even raises his hand and takes the oath of office. Peterson writes: ?In the United States, it is illegal for businesses to use false statements to convince consumers to purchase their services. The evidence indicates that Trump University used a systemic pattern of fraudulent representations to trick thousands of families into investing in a program that can be argued was a sham. ?Fraud and racketeering are serious crimes that legally rise to the level of impeachable acts.? Continue reading below the advertisement In the paper, which is titled Trump University and Presidential Impeachment, Professor Peterson also notes: ?Somehow in the cacophony of the 2016 presidential campaign, no legal academic has yet turned to the question of whetherTrump alleged behavior would, if proven, rise to the level of impeachable offenses under the impeachment clause of the United States Constitution.? So instead of taking up residence at the White House, Trump could instead be facing a trial in the Senate and another in federal court which could well wind up result in him having to pay back tens of millions of dollars to the very people he cheated with his bogus university. And if he were found guilty of racketeering, Trump could even be sent to federal prison where he belongs. Hey, Donald:Don get too excited on election night.

" On the campaign battlefield, Donald Trump follows a doctrine of disproportionate force. Even 50 days out from the election, after countless attempted ""pivots"" to a steadier pose, his impulses -- to meet even a modest political jab, unflattering piece of reporting, or polite interruption with deeply personal attacks -- remain mostly unchecked. He was back at it this weekend with harsh assaults on a former defense secretary and a New York Times columnist. During the long primary season, Trump responded to criticism from his opponents with mocking nicknames and scornful insults. Then it was Hillary Clinton's turn. Along the way, the parents of a slain war hero, a federal judge, reporters, and even a pastor from Flint, Michigan, have been confronted with the same lopsided tactics. Here are some of Trump's most pointed reprisals. Hints that former Defense Sec. Bob Gates has 'a problem' Robert Gates has some concerns with Donald Trump. The former defense secretary, who served under both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, called the Republican nominee ""cavalier"" and ""willfully ignorant"" in a Wall Street Journal op-ed last week. The piece was also frequently critica l of Clinton, but called Trump beyond repair. ""He's a nasty guy,"" Trump said Saturday of Gates, whom he also called ""an absolute clown."" ""Probably has a problem that we don't know about."" Trump has not elaborated on the nature of the ""problem."" Earlier in the day, the Republican nominee, in a tweet, assigned Gates a nickname -- ""dopey"" -- before criticizing him for speaking ""badly of his many bosses, including Obama."" Never met but never liked dopey Robert Gates. Look at the mess the U.S. is in. Always speaks badly of his many bosses, including Obama. ? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2016 It wasn't the first time Trump seemed to chalk up their differences to a lack of facetime. ""He knows nothing about me"" he tweeted . ""But look at the results under his guidance - a total disaster!"" Describes Flint pastor as a ""nervous mess"" When Rev. Faith Green Timmons briefly interrupted him , asking that he steer clear of political attacks, during a speech at her church in Flint, Michigan, Trump promptly quit and reversed course. ""OK, that's good,"" he said, almost sheepishly. ""Then I'm going back onto Flint, OK?"" He did -- and it was. For a few hours. But by the next morning, Trump was lashing out at the pastor, calling her a ""nervous wreck."" ""She was so nervous, she was shaking,"" he told Fox News . ""And I said, 'wow, this was kind of strange.' And then she came up. So she had that in mind, no question about it."" Critical women = 'neurotic' On the subject of nervous conditions: Trump responded to New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, who told CNN on Saturday that the candidate ""thought the violence (at rallies) added a frisson of excitement,"" in a familiar tone. In the first of two tweets, he called Dowd ""wacky"" and a ""neurotic dope."" A minute later, she was ""crazy."" Wacky @NYTimesDowd, who hardly knows me, makes up things that I never said for her boring interviews and column. A neurotic dope! ? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2016 If that looks familiar, it's because Trump has repeatedly used the same language to insult other female critics. In August, it was MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski. ""Tried watching low-rated @Morning_Joe this morning, unwatchable!,"" he tweeted. Brzezinski ""is off the wall, a neurotic and not very bright mess! Tried watching low-rated @Morning_Joe this morning, unwatchable! @morningmika is off the wall, a neurotic and not very bright mess! ? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 22, 2016 And about a month earlier, when now-former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned ahead of the party's convention in Philadelphia, Trump chimed in by calling her ""highly neurotic."" The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out! ? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2016 A couple weeks earlier, after Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called Trump ""a faker"" -- a comment for which she would later apologize -- he took a similar shot at her mental state. ""Her mind is shot,"" he tweeted . ""Resign!"" Repeated swipes at the family of slain war hero Trump targeted the parents of Army Capt. Humayun Khan, killed in 2004 by a suicide bomber in Iraq, in a prolonged back-and-forth in the days after the Democratic National Convention. In an impassioned speech on the convention's final night, Khizr Khan, the soldier's father, said to Trump, ""You have sacrificed nothing and no one,"" then offered to lend the GOP nominee a copy of his pocket-sized U.S. Constitution. The barb did not sit well. Trump first suggested that the slain soldier's mother, who stood quietly by her husband's side during his remarks, had been muzzled by her religion. ""His wife, if you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say,"" Trump said during an interview with ABC News . ""Maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say."" (A day later, Mrs. Khan explained in an op-ed that she had been silenced only by her grief.) Upset that Khizr Khan appeared on television after his speech, he continued his barrage on Twitter , first writing, ""Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!"" Then, 17 minutes later: ""This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!"" This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart! ? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2016 Calls reporter a 'sleaze' during a news conference Before he mostly shut out the press and eschewed news conferences, Trump gathered the media at New York's Trump Tower in late May to provide information and answer questions about his fundraising for veterans groups. But the Republican nominee soon maligned the press for not offering what he considered to be proper credit for his charitable giving. ABC News reporter Tom Llamas called out Trump for exaggerating the initial totals. JUST WATCHED Donald Trump attacks media, calls reporter 'sleazy' Replay More Videos ...

Trump immediately rejected the math, saying he expected the number would eventually surpass $6 million, then turned on Llamas, eventually calling him ""a sleaze."" When a reporter asked if a Trump presidency would take on a similar tone, the billionaire businessman responded, ""Yeah, it is going to be like this."" ""You think I'm going to change?"" he said. ""I'm not going to change.""

Elizabeth Warren as 'Pocahontas' When Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren sought to match Trump's Twitter fire, using some of the same harsh language he has made a staple of the campaign, he responded in kind -- and upped the ante, repeatedly calling her ""Pocahontas,"" a reference to the 2012 controversy over her claimed Native American heritage Since Warren emerged as one of his chief antagonists, Trump has been unyielding in his attacks.

Repeated attacks on Megyn Kelly Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly has been targeted repeatedly by Trump after she asked a pointed question about his past remarks regarding women at the first GOP debate last August. Initially retweeting supporters who called her a ""bimbo"" and other offensive terms, Trump dialed it up a couple days later.

"The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments.NBC Lester Holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to ?fact-check? him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong. In one of the more contentious exchanges, Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning, but Trump continuously denied it, USA Politics Today* reported. Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war, Holt continued to press Trump, saying that in an interview with Fox News? Neil Cavuto, Trump expressed his support for the war. After the debate was over, Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trumpwasn all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in ? he had his reservations. TRENDING:Gov Confiscates Family Pet to Use as ?Educational Animal? ?You know, what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? I mean he would go in and attack. Hewouldn talk. I mean we have to, you know,it sort of like either do it ordon do it,? Trump said. ?Well,he (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps heshouldn be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know,he under a lot of pressure,? said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice. You can see it here: Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged supportfor the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did. Itshouldn surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smearTrump name. Luckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.

"9875 SHARES SHARES FacebookTwitter GooglePinterestDiggLinkedin Reddit Stumbleupon PrintDeliciousPocketTumblrIt no secret that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie would like to be part of a Trump administration, probably in the role of Attorney General. But he may have to do it from prison if prosecutors are able to prove what they alleged in court today. The New York Times reports that prosecutors in the Bridgegatetrial of former Christie associates Bridget Anne Kelly and Bill Baroni said during opening statements on Monday morning that Christie was aware of what was going on as it was happening. Defense attorneys for Kelly and Baroni had also previously claimed that Christie was aware of the supposed ?traffic study? that was taking place at the Fort Lee, New Jersey entrance to the George Washington Bridge, but this is the first time prosecutors have publicly agreed with them. Prosecutors said that Baroni and David Wildstein, both alleged conspirators in the case, had bragged to Christie about the chaos being created by the lane closings, and how they had created the bogus traffic study to mess with the mayor of Fort Lee, a Democrat who had balked at endorsingChristie re-election bid. But prosecutor Vikas Khanna, also told the jury that they should not wonder why othersweren?t charged in the case. Christie has denied knowing about what Baroni and Wildstein allegedly did until months later. But Khanna told the jury that the governor was informed at a September 11 memorial service in 2013, three days after the lane closures started, while they were still going on: ?The evidence will show that Baroni and Wildstein were so committed to their plan to punish mayor Sokolich during those few minutes they had alone with the Governor they bragged about the fact there were traffic problems in Fort Lee and Mayor Sokolich was not getting his calls returned.? Wildstein, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in the case last year, is now thegovernment star witness. Attorneys for Baroni and Kelly described him asChristie puppet.Baroni attorney, Michael Baldassare, said, ?When David Wildstein spoke governorChristie voice came out and everybody knew it.? There is still no evidence that Christie knew or approved of the scheme ahead of time. But if prosecutors can prove that the governor did indeed know what was happening while it was still going on, and did nothing to stop it, it could cause serious problems for his barely concealed aspirations to be a member ofTrump cabinet. Of course, with any luck therewon be a Trump cabinet for him to be a member of. Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images Like this: Like Loading...

"Trump hints Obama to blame for Charlotte unrest But he also presented himself as someone who could heal America's racial divide. Donald Trump on Thursday pinned the blame for the turmoil in Charlotte, North Carolina, on President Barack Obama, suggesting that the violent protests there show a ?wounded country? that ?looks bad to the world.? Pausing for roughly 10 minutes during an energy speech in Pittsburgh to address the Charlotte unrest, Trump also presented himself as the man to healAmerica racial divide. Story Continued Below ?Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country, and it seems to be a never-ending problem,? Trump said. ?America desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not really only got us through our toughest times, andwe had some tough times, but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation.? He called for a swift end to violence against citizens and law enforcement, insisting that such actions hurt law-abiding African-American families most, and proposed a national anti-crime agenda to address what he characterized as a ?national crisis.? He also vowed to make American cities safer by appointing ?the best prosecutors, investigators and federal law enforcement officers? and sympathized with police officers, who carry an ?immense responsibility? but must be trained properly, respect the public and be held accountable for any wrongdoing. And he took a shot atObama leadership, or lack thereof. ?We all have to walk a mile in someoneelse shoes, see things through their eyes and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. I mean,it ? we have some real problems, and we do have a wounded country,? Trump said. ?Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screens. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be theworld leader. How can we lead when wecan even control our own cities?? Trump, who emphasized that it will be the 45thpresident responsibility ?to address this crisis and save African-American lives,? has made an attempt to gain support from African-Americans in recent weeks, albeit through a narrative of poorly educated, impoverished black people who live in crime-ridden inner cities and who, after years of Democratic policies he says has failed them, have nothing to lose by supporting his campaign. Trump's overtures to black voters ? often made in front of overwhelmingly white audiences ? have done little to dent Hillary Clinton's 80-point advantage among African- Americans. And his sometimes ham-fisted appeals have come along with statements that have done himself further damage: Only hours earlier, he recommended a controversial stop-and-frisk policy, a policing tactic that has been found to disproportionately targets minorities, to curb violence in Chicago, Obama's hometown, and made the unsubstantiated claim that ?drugs are a very, very big factor? in what's happening in Charlotte. Still, Trump has tried to cast himself as a unifying figure. Earlier Thursday, during a phone interview with ?Fox and Friends,? the Republican presidential nominee said there ?just seems thatthere a lack of spirit between the white and the black.? ?I mean,it a terrible thing thatwe witnessing,? he continued. ?You?re seeing it. I'm seeing it, and you look at what went on last night in Charlotte ? a great place ? and you just see it.? Protests over the killing of Keith Lamont Scott, a black man who was fatally shot by police on Tuesday, turned violent on Wednesday night, leading North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency in Charlotte. By Thursday, Charlotte officials and Scott's family were arguing over whether he had been carrying a gun when he was shot. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney told reporters that police believe Scott was armed, though he acknowledged that a video of his encounter does not prove that conclusively. Putney said the video would be shown to Scott's family but did not commit to releasing it to the public. At a press conference Thursday afternoon, attorneys forScott family refused to commit to calling for the video to be made public or to addressing the media after viewing it. Charles Monnett, one of thefamily lawyers, said the family's decision would depend on whether the video ""can somehow help us reach that truth."" Justin Bamberg, another of thefamilyattorney, said he had not seen any evidence that a gun was present at the scene where Scott was shot. Bamberg dismissed photos showing a gun at the scene by remarking that ?pictures pop up online all the time. They come from different sources.? He said that as far as he was aware, Scott did not own a gun. Bamberg also confirmed thatScott wife was present when he was shot. ?At the end of the day, my priority is the greater good of this family first. That has to be understood,? Bamberg said when asked why thefamily legal team would not commit to calling for the video to be made public. ?Yes, we want transparency. We don't create the facts. We live with the facts. But you can't take the burden that is placed on law enforcement as sworn officers and public servants and put that on a deceased person for their family who is in mourning.? The Obama administration, meanwhile, urged calm -- but the president himself had not made a statement as of 5:00 p.m. ET on Thursday. Attorney General Loretta Lynch addressed the difficultiesher home state faces but warned against any violent reactions. ?I know that these are difficult times, and I know that the events of recent days are painfully unclear and they call out for answers,? she said. ?But I also know that the answer will not be found in the violence of recent days. Let us seek all peaceful way forward.? White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that the vast majority of people had demonstrated peacefully. ?Unfortunately, we've seen situations in which a small number of people take advantage of that peaceful public protest to engage in criminal activity and, in some cases, violence,? he said. ?We've often heard from the families of those who were killed urging people with concerns to express those concerns peacefully and to not perpetuate the cycle of violence. Those have often been quite powerful calls and those are calls that the president has strongly supported.? Wednesday's violence erupted as residents, outraged over Scott's death and that of an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last week, looted and vandalized cars and businesses in downtown Charlotte. According to reports, police in riot gear used tear gas to try to calm protesters, several of whom were injured, including one who was shot by another protester, police said. ?I see it even going out.There such a lack of ?there a lack of spirit,? Trump said. ?There?s a lack of something.Something going onthat bad, andwhat going on between police and others is getting worse.? The real estate mogul renewed his call for law and order, pitching it as the solution to the unrest in Charlotte and outrage nationwide over police-involved shootings of black men, who in many cases have been unarmed when they were fatally shot. ?Well,it wow, here we go again,? Trump said. ?It?s very sad. When you look atwhat going on,it very sad.It very divided, our country, andit getting worse.I not overly surprised to see it, butit happening.? Trump argued that a dialogue between police and the communities they servewon solve this problem, pointing to the ambush in Dallas this summer, when a black man killed five officers and injured a dozen more. ?If you look at Dallas, there was a dialogue. They prided themselves on dialogue,? Trump said. ?And they were constantly talking and meeting and having community groups and, you know, that was ? that was a pretty rough situation, to put it mildly. A terrible, terrible situation. That sounds good. It sounds right, butthere something deeper than that.?What necessary, Trump maintained, is a combination of law and order and leadership that can unify a divided nation, leadership he intimated is lacking fromAmerica current leader. ?Well, it really has to be ? you have to have law and order at the time, you have to have, you know, you have to have a certain spirit, a certain unity, andthere no unity,? Trump said. ?You look at the level of hatred, the, you know, the rocks being thrown and everything happening.It so sad to see. You know, this is the United States of America. I mean,it so sad to see. Butthere just no unity. There has to be a unity message that has to get out, and it starts with leadership.? But what Trumpdidn say explicitly, his surrogates did. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared in separate Fox News segments in which they both slammedObama lack of leadership. ?First of all,it a tragedy that eight years after our first African-American president took office, eight years afterwe had two African-American attorney generals, the gap and the hostility, if anything, is worse, and I thinkthat a tragic failure of leadership,? Gingrich said. ?But my guess is he was afraidit make him a black president in a narrowing sense,? he added. ?He could have launched a program to try to rebuild and reopen and re-engineer hope in these communities. And instead, he became the person who talked about, you know, the Cambridge policeman was wrong, and, you know, Ferguson was wrong and why Florida was wrong.? Giuliani said Obama should have lectured Americans on constitutional law Wednesday.

""The U.S. should not turn control of the Internet over to the United Nations and the international community.

Interested in Elections? Add Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have discussed their proposals for law enforcement on the campaign trail. Hillary Clinton's Plan Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters The Democratic nominee has laid out two specific steps for bring change within law enforecment. The first would be to call on law enforcement and communities to ""develop national guidelines on the use of force by police officers,"" Clinton said in a speech about her plan on July 8, 2016, the day after five police officers were ambushed and killed during a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas. The protest was held in the wake of fatal police shootings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile in Minnesota. ""We?ll make it clear for everyone to see when deadly force is warranted, and when itisn,"" Clinton said in her speech, which was before the general conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia. The second step would be to ""acknowledge that implicit bias still exists across our society and even in the best police departments"" and commit $1 billion to fund new training programs and support research, she said. ""We do need police and criminal justice reforms, to save lives and make sure all Americans are treated equally in rights and dignity,"" Clinton said in the speech, her most extensive talk yet on the issue of policing. ""We do need to support police departments and stand up for the men and women who put their lives on the line every day to protect us. We do need to reduce gun violence. We may disagree about how to go about these things, but surely we can all agree with those basic premises. Her plan specifically focuses on ""reducing excessive violence, reforming our sentencing laws, supporting police departments that are doing things right, and making it harder for the wrong people to get their hands on guns,"" she said. Clinton had also previously spoken about the need to end racial profiling. In October, her team noted that she plans to support legislation banning racial profiling on federal, state and law enforcement levels. She co-sponsored similar acts while she was in the Senate. Donald Trump's Plan Craig F. Walker/The Boston Globe, via Getty Images The Republican nominee, unlike Clinton, has given no speeches that specifically focus on his plans regarding law enforcement tactics. Instead, the self-anointed ""law-and-order candidate"" has made passing remarks on several law enforcement topics at different times. He has said that police need ""better training,"" as evidenced by certain shootings. ""Even when they wear cameras police wear the cameras you need training. You have to have training. You have to have better training obviously than what they have,"" he said during an interview with the Impact Network in September. Most recently, Trump said controversial ""stop-and-frisk"" practices that were previously used in New York City would be a way to end violence in the black community. The morning after mentioning this during a town hall with voters in Cleveland on Sept. 21, Trump said he didn't mean stop-and-frisk should be implemented nationally, but only in Chicago because ""Chicago is out of control."" Trump has also mentioned that mosques should be under surveillance, though he has wavered on the topic. He has also suggested that old military gear should be handed over to police departments, but did not go into detail. In the wake of the bombings last weekend in New York City and New Jersey, Trump said police should be allowed to profile, though his son Donald Trump Jr. later took issue with it being called ""racial profiling."" ""They see somebody that's suspicious, they will profile,"" the candidate said on Fox News on Monday. ""Look what's going on: Do we really have a choice?

"Story highlights The measure failed 45-55 The action comes three days before Friday's midnight deadline Washington (CNN) Senate Democrats on Tuesday blocked a Republican bill to fund the government and battle Zika because it did not include money for Flint, Michigan, to address the city's drinking water crisis. The action comes three days before Friday's midnight deadline when agencies are set to run out of money and left congressional leaders searching for a compromise bill that could get enough votes to pass and head off an election season government shutdown. Needing 60 votes to pass, the measure failed 45-55. While 12 GOP senators also voted against the measure -- for reasons ranging from concerns over spending to the bill's lack of language making changes to the Export-Import Bank -- it was the solid block of ""nay"" votes from Democrats that halted the bill. One possible solution was suggested by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said he might drop flood money for Louisiana and other states to satisfy Democrats who insisted they would not support emergency disaster aid for some states while leaving Flint behind. ""We keep hearing that their position is no Flint, no floods. And that's certainly an option worth discussing,"" McConnell told reporters.

"President Obama is right ? it appears the people running the Trump campaign skipped their history and civics classes. After Donald Trump got a lashing from black activists after claimingit ?never been worse? for them than it is right now, one would think the campaign would have gotten the message and moved on accordingly. Wrong. As usual, no one in the Trump campaign learns their lesson. And their sheer ignorance has cost them a key staff member in a key swing state.Trump campaign chair in the prominent Mahoning County in Ohio, Kathy Miller, has resigned from her position after denying there was any racism in the 1960s and that if black peopleweren successful in the last 50 years,it their own fault. She also said therewasn ?any racism until Obama got elected? and skirted problems under the table: Ifyou black and youhaven been successful in the last 50 years,it your own fault.You had every opportunity, it was given to you.You had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kidsdidn have. You had all the advantages anddidn take advantage of it.It not our fault, certainly.

"Mondaynight debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will be a battle offacts, perhaps more likely, half-facts and flat-out lies. Both candidates, after all, have called out for being exceptionally untrustworthy in a professionthat not known for its uprightness. At the New Yorker, David Remnick has said of Clinton, ?[She] has had her bald-facedmoments that are too kindly described as ?lawyerly,?? while Nicholas Kristof recently wrote, ?If deception were a sport, Trump would be the Olympic gold medalist.? When number crunchers are on the case, the candidatesdon fare much better: Politico Magazine recently fact-checked aweek worth of eachcandidate statements, and found that Trump had uttered one untruth every 3.25 minutes and Clinton, every 12 minutes. In fact, just half ofClinton factual assertions have been found to be trueor ?mostly true? by the nonpartisan fact-checkers at Politifact, andTrump statements only come in at a pitiful 15 percent. Little wonder that polling shows more than half of likely votersdon think either candidate is honest, the highest level of distrust in recent elections. Story Continued Below This heightened concern about truthfulness has prompted heated conversations about whether debate moderators should be responsible for live fact-checking. (Clinton says yes, Trump no.) But viewers can prepare themselves regardless: Knowing thatwe in for gale-force fabrications on Monday, how can you steel yourself for the lies ahead? Todd Rogers, an associate professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, has published two major studies about deception and how audiences respond to it. He has identified five tactics that are mainstays in Americanpolitics why they often work on us.Here a guide to those five types of deception and howthey been deployed in recent political history. 1. Artful Dodging What it is: Answering a different question than the one that wasasked quite a lie, but an evasion. Whenyou seen it: Nearly all political debates feature at least one dodge, also known as a ?pivot.? In one Republican primary debate, Trump was asked, ?Do you still believe President Bush should have been impeached???to which his response started, ?First of all, I have to say, as a businessman I get along with everybody. I have business all over the world.? (The rest of his responsedidn answer the question either.) In one ofClinton primary debates, she avoided a direct answer about the content of her Goldman Sachs speeches even when pressed. Why it works: Rogers has found that viewers? limited attention is tied up in deciding whether they like a candidate, not whether the candidate is actually responding to the question. Since many dodges go undetected, candidatesdon often lose points for them. In fact, in the same study, speakers who eloquently answered a similar question were rated as highly as those who inartfully answered the actualquestion. 2. Paltering What it is: Actively using truthful statements to lead a listener to a false conclusion. Whenyou seen it: The best-known political example is probably BillClinton line during an interview about the Monica Lewinsky scandal: ?There is no sexual relationship with that woman,? a sly but truthful use of the present tense to obscure past misdeeds. (Five days later, he upgraded to full-blown lie with ?I did not have sexual relations with that woman.?) Trump has also used this tactic when asked about the bankruptcy of Trump Entertainment Resorts: ?Seven years ago, I left Atlantic City before it totally cratered, and I made a lot of money in Atlantic City.? The facts are true, but the statement misleadingly recasts a business failure in a positive light. Why it works: Paltering is hard to pick up on, sinceyou technically hearing the truth. And Rogers? research shows that even when outside observers knowit happening, they consider it more benign than outright lies of commission (see below). 3. Explicit Avoidance What it is: Flat-out refusing to engage with a sticky subject. Whenyou seen it: Politicians use this tactic when they refuse to release their tax returns, like Trump, or medical records, like Hillary Clinton. More often, you see it when politicians or their spokespeople employ the classic ?no comment,? or a similar sentiment, as when Bernie Sanders responded to a question about the failures ofVenezuela socialist model with: ?Of course I have an opinion, but as I said,I focused on my campaign.? Clinton has done him one better, refusing for much of the campaign to face the press at all (and earning considerable criticism for it). Why it works: Actually, itdoesn. Rogers? colleagues have demonstrated that listeners trust and prefer people who reveal to people who hide, even when the information is damaging. 4. Lying by Commission What it is: Saying something you know to be untrue in order to mislead your audience. Whenyou seen it: Politicians most often employ straight-up lies when denying involvement in a scandal. See: AnthonyWeiner initial denial thathe sent anyone a close-up photo of his underwear,saying, ?This was a prank, a hoax.? Or the response by Congressman MarkFoley camp to allegations thathe sent inappropriate messages to congressional pages: ?[This is part of an] an ugly smear campaign.? In this election cycle, Trump has famously clung to the false assertion that he always opposed the Iraq War. Why it works: This tactic can backfire ifdetected Weiner and Foley resigned under pressure, after all. But plenty of political mistruths have remarkable staying power even after being debunked, like claims, long disseminated by Trump, that Barack Obama is a Muslim or was born in Kenya. 5. Lying by Omission What it is: Failing to disclose a piece of relevant information or context, which renders a statement untrue. Whenyou seen it: In promoting the Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama and his team made a number of statements like, ?If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.? Thiswasn strictlytrue could only keep your plan if ithadn changed since the ACA was passed. More recently, Trump has trumpeted the virtues of American manufacturing while failing to mention that several Trump products are made overseas. AndClinton handling of her private email server could be viewed as one extended lie of omission, since she and her team have provided incomplete information and records on multiple occasions. Why it works: If the public believes something untrue but desirable about a candidate, failure to correct the misperception works in thecandidate favor. And research has suggested that people prefer tellinglies of omission to lies of commission. Not only is the former therefore morecommon?s also harder to hold people accountable for something theydidn say than something they did. Still, lies of omission can work against candidates if audiences suspectthey not being told the whole story. Of course, lies of omission are designed not to dedetected like other forms of deception. But by studying up on Rogers? taxonomy of deceit, perhaps debate viewers will better be able to pick up on any misleading tactics the candidates choose to deploy.

James Cartwright, who pled guilty on Monday to a felony charge of making false statements to the FBI in connection with an investigation into leaks about a U.S.-Israel cyber operation to undermineIran nuclear program. A number of statements Clinton made about her use of a private email server have turned out to be dubious or inaccurate, although FBI Director James Comey has said he does not believe that Clinton made false statements to his agency during its investigation. Republican lawmakers have questioned several ofClinton statements, including her claim that none of her emails were marked classified, when three had portion markings for classified records ? but not proper markings at the top and bottom. Other Clinton statements have also been questioned, although she often couched them as an inability to recall certain events, making it difficult to label them as lies. Clinton said last week in written answers to a federal lawsuit that she did not recall any communcation with computer aide Bryan Pagliano about management or preservation of records in her account, but a conservative group said it has a 2012 email exchange between Clinton and Pagliano about her not receiving messages on her blackberry. During the court hearing this week, Cartwright admitted that he provided and confirmed classified information to one reporter and confirmed classified information to another, although as part of a plea bargain he pled guilty to lying to investigators and not to leaking, which could have carried a more severe penalty.

Republicans, including some of his own friends, have noted thathe become something of a loose canon since returning to Washington after being defeated in his primary in August. ?So much for all of Mr.Huelskamp rhetoric about the need for lame duck members to go quietly into the night,? said one GOP official. To be fair, however, a number of House Freedom Caucus members and the Heritage Foundation also had objections to several proposals. His office also noted that ""a quick review appears to indicate that this is the largest number of suspensions in one day for the entire 2015-2016 Congressional calendar."" ""Americans deserve better than for Congressional leaders to decide late on a Friday to suddenly place 49 bills on the calendar,"" his office wrote POLITICO in an email. ""With no clear, public criteria for selection of these bills from among thousands of others, Americans at least deserve the transparency of knowing how their Member of Congress votes on these bills."" Establishment-aligned outside groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and JoeRickett ?Ending Spending? group poured more than a million intoHuelskamp race to defeat him. They said he was ineffective because he voted against everything, and argued his poor relationships in Washington got him kicked off the Agriculture Committee, a prized spot for his district. Huelskamp blames House GOP leadership for not coming to his rescue. In recent dayshe openly criticized Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Some members groused privately that Huelskamp looked all too happy to scuttle the floor schedule Tuesday evening. He sat in the back row of the House chamber, avoiding the C-SPAN cameras but asking for roll calls on bills. Usually lawmakers go down to the desk ? in full view of the cameras ? to request the yeas and nays. Meanwhile, around the capitol, one of the biggest questions driving Tuesday chatter was whether he would force the IRS impeachment issue later this week.",0.017291066,0.011527378000000001,0.005763689000000001,0.014409222,0.040345821000000004,0.296829971,0.002881844,2,-1,1

"Washington  Ten judges on a powerful federal appeals court in Washington heard more than six hours of arguments Tuesday concerning a cornerstone of President Barack Obama's legacy on the environment: the Clean Power Plan. The Environmental Protection Agency's plan is meant to reduce climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions by targeting existing coal-fired and natural gas power plants with a goal of reduce greenhouse emissions up to 32% by 2030. It would require states to meet specific carbon emission reduction standards based on their individual energy consumption, and it includes an incentive program for states to get a head start on meeting standards on early deployment of renewable energy. Dozens of lawyers from the government, industry and public interest groups packed the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, to hear the divisive case that comes just weeks before a heated presidential election and illustrates how a President's picks for the lower court might impact his own agenda. The plan is currently frozen because last February, the Supreme Court voted to delay implementation until the appeals process could play out. Opponents to the plan claim that the EPA went too far under the law to push the rule. Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh at one point questioned EPA's authority. ""This is a huge case,"" he said and noted that it could ""fundamentally"" transform the industry. Kavanaugh said the administration's policy is ""laudable"" but questioned under the separation of powers whether Congress, and not the EPA, had to speak clearly on the issue. Judge Thomas B. Griffith chimed in asking, ""why isn't this debate going on in the floor of the Senate?"" rather than before a panel of judges. But Judge Patricia A. Millet reiterated at one point that the Supreme Court ""has already said"" that the EPA has the authority to regulate in the area. Other judges questioned whether by 2030, the rule would be any more transformative to the coal industry, for example, than market forces would be. Judge David S. Tatel asked whether the agency was simply ""invoking existing authority."" While the morning session in court was dedicated to statutory arguments, in the afternoon the court heard arguments concerning whether it was unconstitutional. The challengers' constitutional arguments did not appear to to get much traction with the judges. On one side is the EPA, 18 states, some power companies and environmental and public health groups who argue in briefs that the rule will ""secure critically important reductions"" in carbon dioxide emissions from what are by far ""the largest emitters in the United States -- fossil-fuel-fired power plants."" They argue that the emissions ""pose a monumental threat to American's health and welfare by driving long-lasting changes in our climate leading to an array of severe negative effects."" The plan is considered important for the US to meet goals set out in a climate treaty signed in Paris last December. On the other side are nearly two dozen states, electric utilities, coal mining companies and the Chamber of Commerce. They say the rule exceeds the agency's statutory authority and goes beyond the bounds set by the Constitution. ""EPA's audacious assertion of authority in this rule is more far-reaching than any previous effort by the agency,"" lawyers for the opposing states argued in court papers. They say that the reduction requirements ""can be met only by shutting down hundreds of coal-fired plants, limiting the use of others, and requiring construction and operation of other types of facilities preferred by EPA."" In a statement back in February, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said,. ""The Clean Power Plan is based on a strong legal and technical foundation, gives states the time and flexibility they need to develop tailored, cost-effective plans to reduce their emissions, and will deliver better air quality, improved public health, clean energy investment and jobs across the country."" By the end of the day, after more than a dozen lawyers had approached the podium, and Judge Karen Henderson acknowledged everyone's long day. ""We've all been through a marathon,"" she said. Court filled with Obama appointees During complex arguments before a multi-member court is dangerous to try to determine -- based on questions posed at oral arguments -- how a judge will ultimately rule. It's worth noting however, that Tuesday's case comes before an appellate court that has been transformed during the Obama administration. Before Obama took office the appeals court tilted toward conservative appointees with six judges nominated by a Republican president and three nominated by a Democratic president. There were also two vacancies. Currently, the active judges on the court consist of four GOP appointees and seven Democratic appointees. In 2013, Obama placed four judges on the court, three of them immediately after the Senate changed its filibuster rules. Tuesday's case was heard by all the active members of the court except for Chief Judge Merrick Garland who has recused himself from hearing cases because he has been nominated to the Supreme Court. ""The party of an appointing president surely makes a difference in some types of cases -- environmental for example -- more than others,"" said Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institute. ""When the full court meets is when the party of appointing president is likely to matter most because the great majority of decisions are made by three-judge panels, randomly drawn and not necessarily reflective of the overall composition of the court."" Because the Supreme Court is currently at a reduced strength of eight the appeals court opinion could be the last word on the subject. A 4-4 tie at the Supreme Court would mean the justices automatically uphold the lower court's opinion. Elizabeth Wydra of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center says that the appeals court is ""exhibit A"" of why judicial nominations are crucial to a president's legacy. ""President Obama was able to put several brilliant legal minds on the bench, who are much more likely to follow the law where it leads rather than accept the extreme conservative deregulatory agenda pushed by this case,"" she said.",0.030640669,0.002785515,0.002785515,0.016713092,0.061281337000000005,0.311977716,0.0,2,-1,1

Jim Gilmore during a rally in front of the Colonial Capitol in Williamsburg, Va., on Sept. 20. | AP Photo At 'soggy' Pence speech, insults rain down WILLIAMSBURG, Va. ? Mike Pence stood with no umbrella before about 650 die-hard supporters in an at times torrid rain Tuesday night, and delivered his stump speech over the chants of protesters less than 100 yards from the stage. It was a dramatic scene here in this colonial village/college town, as the skies opened up but did not deter DonaldTrump running mate. Story Continued Below ?You people are awesome,? Pence told the crowd as he took the stage while a steady rain poured down. He acknowledged it was a ?moist evening.? When he prepared to leave the stage just over 20 minutes later to work the rope line, he conceded the night was ?soggy.? ?Tonight,we showing the media and showing the world this is a movementthat going to elect Donald Trump as the next president of the United States,? Pence told the crowd. The outdoor rally meant vulnerability not only to the weather, but also to local permitting ordinances. A throng of about a dozen protesters with Clinton-Kaine signs stood just behind the press pen and sought repeatedly to disrupt the speech. ?Pro women, pro choice!? the group chanted at one point. ?Monica!? a man yelled at them. At another point the group shouted, ?We are all immigrants!? ?You?re all idiots!? a man nearby retorted. A chant of ?You are racist!? morphed seamlessly into an ?America?s already great!? chant. But whenever Pence, in a soaking wet suit, hit his applause lines, the crowd drowned out the protesters. Pence stuck to the message he has been hammering since the weekend, accusing Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama of a foreign policy that opened the doors for the kinds of terrorist attacks that hit New York, New Jersey and Minnesota on Saturday. ?You know, theirs is narrative of denial,? Pence said of the administration and the Democrats. ?Truth of the matter is we need a president who understands we are in a real fight against terrorists, against radical Islamic terrorism, against the ISIS caliphate. And when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, we will take the fight to the enemy, we will destroy ISIS at its source and we will defeat radical Islamic terrorism wherever it emerges.? After the speech, Pence got a change of clothes and delivered towels to damp reporters on the back of his plane.

"Donald Trump has praised the policing tactic known as ?stop and frisk? on the campaign trail, but the controversial technique has a questionable history in New York City. Interested in Donald Trump? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest The stop-question-and-frisk program entails NYPD officers? randomly stopping people on the street, on the theory that such searches help law enforcement identify people with illegal handguns and deter crime. Supporters credit the program with helping to push down homicides and other major crimes in New York City to historic lows, but opponents have another description: racial profiling. A federal judge in New York ruled in 2013 that the program was unconstitutional and violated the rights of minorities because they were being disproportionally targeted by the practice. Between 2003 and 2015, for instance, more than half of those who were subjected to searches were black and about 30 percent of the other searches were of Latinos, according to an analysis of New York Police Department records by the New York Civil Liberties Union. The NYPD stopped the most New Yorkers in 2011 -- 685,724 ? before the number dropped to 532,911 in 2012 and 191,558 in 2013, the year when the federal ruling was handed down. The number of reported stops then dropped dramatically to 45,787 in 2014 and 22,939 last year, according to the figures analyzed by the NYCLU. ""Tactics like stop and frisk or tactics that utilize race-based profiles are ineffective because theydon differentiate between those in the community who may be involved in criminal activity and those who are simply residents in the community,? professor John Cohen of the Rutgers University School of Criminal Justice said. ""So what tends to happen is you tend to have a greater number of confrontational police interactions with members of the community who are not involved in any type of illegal activity. That not only is ineffective operationally but it also tends to cause tension between those members of the community who are the people you want to have good relationships with,? Cohen, an ABC News consultant, former police officer and former acting Homeland Security undersecretary, added. The NYPD records analyzed by the NYCLU note that the number of people who were completely innocent account for 80 to 90 percent of the searches. ""It?s not helping you in the short run because your officers are spending time with people whoaren involved in criminal activity,? Cohen said. Trump, who has calls himself the ?law and order candidate,? has lauded the NYPD ?stop and frisk? program on the campaign trail, saying in Ohio Wednesday the program ?was incredible, the way that worked.? When asked by an African-American audience member at the Fox News town hall event about how he would stop violence in the black community, Trump said, ""I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.? But his praise may not sit well with many African-American voters, whom Trump has been actively courting in recent weeks. Cohen said, ""The reason why African-Americans and other minority members will react negatively to his comments on stop and frisk is because many African-Americans and Latinos equate stop and frisk with racial profiling and, from a law enforcement perspective, racial profiling is operationally ineffective and unconstitutional.? Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-NY, took issue with Trump's suggestion today when asked about it during a news conference for the Congressional Black Caucus. ""For years 'stop, question and frisk' was implemented in New York and it had nothing to do with the decline in crime,"" Jeffries said. ""The notion that stop and frisk had anything to do with the improving public safety numbers in New York is ludicrous and Donald trump needs to check his facts,"" he said.",0.022123893999999998,0.006637168000000001,0.002212389,0.011061946999999999,0.050884955999999995,0.283185841,0.0,2,-1,1
"The debate moderator seemed to ask relatively few questions, allowing prolonged exchanges by the candidates. | Getty What you didn't hear at the Trump-Clinton debate The showdown skated past some of the major controversies of this political season. It was a sober night Monday for those whose debate drinking games counted on the candidates throwing around campaign buzzwords like Benghazi, the border wall and the Clinton Foundation. While those issues dominated various phases of the 2016 run for the White House, none were uttered during the first presidential debate. Story Continued Below Hillary Clinton may have been so surprised by the lack of mention of the Benghazi attacks that she felt emboldened to actually allude to the tragic episode herself, arguing late in the debate that her ability to endure 11 hours of questioning from the House Benghazi Committee disproved Donald Trump's claim that she lacked the ""stamina"" to be president. Moments after the debate, Trump grumbled on Twitter about topics he thought moderator and NBC anchor Lester Holt should have raised, but didn't. ""Nothing on emails. Nothing on the corrupt Clinton Foundation. And nothing on #Benghazi,"" Trump wrote, in a tweet that did not mention Holt by name. Many commentators and some Trump supporters noted that Trump did nothing to raise allegations of improprieties involving Clinton Foundation fundraising or what the GOP has alleged is Clinton's failure to make sure the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi had adequate security at the time four Americans were killed there in 2012. Trump did bring up the ubiquitous email issue himself, saying he'd release his tax returns when she released 33,000 emails she deleted before turning a roughly equal number over to the State Department in 2014. Clinton says she no longer has those messages, but she never directly answered Trump's question about why they were deleted nor did she respond when Holt briefly followed up on the point. Trump also failed to mention Clinton's claim that about half of his supporters were ""deplorables""?a statement she has withdrawn and apologized for. While Trump lamented that Clinton's vulnerabilities didn't receive much attention in the debate, some of Democrats' hobby horses about Trump also got brushed aside. Allegations that the Trump University real estate seminar program was a fraud that bilked participants of up to $35,000 apiece have been fodder for campaign ads and lawsuits and even led to Trump's startling claim that a Latino judge should be removed from the case because of his heritage. But there was no mention at all of Trump U. Monday night, nor of the controversy over the Trump Foundation's illegal donation to a Florida political group or the foundation's unusual affinity for purchasing oversized portraits of its namesake. Some of the world's most urgent crises, like the ongoing violence in Syria estimated to have killed more than 400,000 people, got no discussion at all from the debate stage in Long Island. It could be that such subjects will get more focus at the second presidential debate, set for Oct. 9 and expected to focus on global affairs. Holt had announced three topics for Monday night'sdebate?s Direction, Achieving Prosperity and SecuringAmerica one might have expected the latter to lead to a substantial discussion of immigration policy and the vetting of refugees, but those issues got only glancing treatment. The NBC News anchor never raised the immigration issue, but Trump brought it up a couple of times. He noted, in garbled language, that he'd been endorsed by a union representing immigration and customs agents. Trump also made a somewhat confusing reference to a recent Department of Homeland Security inspector general report that found hundreds of instances where immigrants were naturalized without complete fingerprint checks that would have shown them to have been previously ordered deported. ""We were deporting 800 people....These people we were going to deport ended up becoming citizens.....Now it turns out it might be 1,500 and they don't even know,"" Trump said. If foreign policy was to be left for another night, major domestic policy issues should have had a good chance Monday. But another favorite punching bag forRepublicans Obama's health carelaw entirely unscathed. Some of the issues that Holt didn't ask about, like climate change or Obamacare, may have been on his question list. But he seemed to ask relatively few questions, allowing prolonged exchanges by the candidates and indulging Trump's requests for rebuttal time. The issue of health care was almost completely bypassed, with the candidates making only the briefest references to it. Clinton added ""health"" to the list of things Trump wasn't supporting if he didn't pay federal income taxes in recent years. Trump said one reason the U.S. doesn't have ""new hospitals"" is because the country has ""squandered"" money on many of Clinton's ""ideas."" Another touch area the candidates didn't delve into Monday: Clinton's health. Trump did say he thought she lacked the ""stamina"" to be president, but he didn't elaborate and he never referenced her recent bout with pneumonia or the video of her appearing to collapse after an outdoor Sept. 11 commemoration ceremony in New York. While the debate tiptoed around the health issue, many Twitter commentators didn't. They noted that Trump seemed to be under the weather, sniffling occasionally and sounding a bit nasal. Perhaps Trump passed up the health-related hit on Clinton because he feared she might have a tart reply suggesting he was being worn down by life on the campaign trail.",0.041867955,0.00805153,0.012882448000000001,0.027375201000000002,0.07890499200000001,0.26247987100000003,0.0,2,-1,1

If it's not, they vow to block the legislation on a key vote in the Senate on Tuesday, leaving little time to get a funding bill through both chambers. But top Democrats signaled Monday there may be a way to resolve the impasse: if House Republicans were to assure them the Flint money would make it into a separate bill that the House is voting on this week. A top House Republican leader seemed receptive to the idea. ""This funding measure does not quote a single penny for Flint, Michigan. Not a penny. The people of Flint, Michigan, have been waiting for emergency assistance to clean their poison water for more than a year,"" Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said in a floor speech. ""Senate Republicans claim they'll address the needs of Flint when we return after the election. We've heard that before, haven't we?"" Republicans counter that Reid's demand for Flint funding to be added to the government spending bill are new and may be politically motivated, designed to disrupt smooth passage of government funding and make Republicans appear ineffective just weeks before the presidential and congressional elections that will determine the balance of power in the capital.

"Swing-state Republicans dump on Trump In front of the largest televised debate audience ever, Donald Trump blew it. Swing-state Republicans expressed frustration at his Monday night performance, characterizing it as a series of missed opportunities to move the dial in the places that will matter most to his electoral fortunes in November. Story Continued Below Name-checking battleground states like Michigan and Ohio was a wise move, state and local GOP leaders said. AndTrump message on trade resonates in industrial areas across the Rust Belt, from Pennsylvania to Wisconsin. But above all else, Republican officials and operatives lamented his lack of preparation and failure to reach persuadable voters, especially women and GOP-leaners who are not yet sold on him. Instead of prosecuting the case against Hillary Clinton ? which would have helped accelerate the consolidation of the GOP base in states like Pennsylvania where once-reticent Republicans are beginning to fall in line behind the nominee ? Trump got bogged down defending controversial decisionshe made, from championing birtherism to making insensitive comments about women. ?I think Trump should have been better prepared,? said Alan Novak, a former Pennsylvania Republican Party chairman. ?Her preparation, strategically, helped her control the flow of that debate. It was like a basketball game when the pace is dictated by one team. She clearly did that. His focus was on himself, explaining too much about him. The opportunity was missed to go after vulnerable points on her.? ?He started out having a little bit of a better [performance] than what I was anticipating, on trade issues I believe he had her back on her heels in the very first part,? said a veteran North Carolina Republican strategist, working on several races in the state. ?There were a lot of opportunities, when they got into discussing cybersecurity, to inject emails, the whole narrative of her carelessness, national security matters and all that. It was a missed opportunity by Trump that comes from a lack of being prepared.? In interviews with more than a dozen battleground state Republican leaders, there was widespread agreement thatTrump core supporters would continue to stand by him, and that the election would remain close in their states ? they characterized the debate as a failure to accomplish what he needed to, rather than a costly debacle. ?Trump had the opportunity to raise questions about her emails, to raise questions about the Clinton Foundation, to raise questions about Benghazi, to raise questions about a host of other things, and he simply failed to do it,? said Charlie Gerow, a GOP strategist based in Pennsylvania. While Trump surrogates criticized moderator Lester Holt after the debate, ?The burden was on him to do that,? said Gerow of Trump. The GOP nominee started the debate off strong, many Republicans agreed, initially pushing a message of change and a successful attack on trade policy. But he was repeatedly drawn into protracted fights thatdidn advance his interests, and his lack of policy command was apparent.Trump approach to national security and foreign policy was a particular sticking point with Bill Urbanski, a former GOP chair of northeasternPennsylvania Luzerne County, who said he was bothered byTrump seemingly contradictory response to a question about whether the U.S. should embrace a no-first-use nuclear weapons policy. ?Trump was just nowhere near actually being responsive to the question that was posed,? he said. ?I guess it could mean two things: one couldbe to dodge the question because he was trying to make a particular point, but the way I read that was, hedidn have an answer to that question.? The end result: Republican-leaners like Urbanski still see no reason to rally to him, raising questions about whether Trump will be able to hit the level of party support achieved by Mitt Romney in Pennsylvania in 2012. ?Man, it continues to trouble me,? said Urbanski, who said he would like to back Trump andcan stomach voting for Clinton. ?This guy is not qualified for this job. He presents himself that way every time I see him. Ican get over that hurdle.? Added Gerow, ?My sense is, no minds were changed last night among those who had cemented theirviews among the 8, 10, 12, 15 percent who are still genuinely persuadable, I think last night slowed down, if not halted,Trump momentum.That, I think, the problem.He got to try to regain momentum. He has to get back on offense.? While there are still two debates to go, therewon be many better chances to win over undecided voters, convince fence-sitting Republicans or energize the base. InOhio Warren County, party regulars were primed for the first showdown between Clinton and Trump, hoping to see him stick it to Clinton at a local GOP watch party. ?We had folks from the statewide and national party, we had local party folks and then we had Trump campaigners, and we had citizens at large,? said Jeff Monroe, the Warren County GOP chairman. ?They were totally into it and all jazzed up, more so than I anticipated. The energy level in the room was significantly better than I anticipated.? But when asked forTrump strongest moments in the debate, Monroe explained his impression this way. ?It?s more along the lines that therewasn anything catastrophic that would change the outcome,? he said. ?I think that what we saw was that he was doing his very best to distinguish himself from both political sets. He was taking that approach,? Monroe said. ?I thinkthat going to play well with a lot of the folks that are supporting him. Regardless of whether or not, as the pundits have pointed out, there was some slippage later on, he distinguished himself.?Florida Republican National Committeeman, Peter Feaman, similarly said hecouldn think of a ?high or low point? for Trump in the debate. But he said Trump did accomplish one important task: He proved he could appear presidential, addressing a weakness that has dogged him among some Republicans in the swing state with the largest haul of electoral votes. ?It was pretty plain. Idon think it contained what a lot of the viewers were hoping to see, which were fireworks. Thatwasn the goal at this point,? he said. Trump certainlydidn deliver anything to persuade Sandra Kase, who serves on the Kingston municipal council in Luzerne County. A lifelong Republican who says she cannot vote for Clinton, Kase said Trump allowed the Democratic nominee to bait him, raising questions about his judgment and his ability to control his temper with world leaders. Equally worrisome, the GOP nominee failed to make strides toward winning over women like Kase in a state where Clinton holds a 14-point edge of Trump among likely women voters, according to a new CNN/ORC poll . ?Just his attitude toward women, sexism, everything that comes out of his mouth turns me off.I sorry, Ican say a good thing about him,? she said. ?Just the whole atmosphere of the debate, his whole attitude, his reaction ? Idon think he has the temperament. As soon as someone goads him into something, he blasts out what we wants to say and feelsthat OK, andit not.?",0.052132701,0.005924171,0.010663507,0.011848341,0.090047393,0.305687204,0.0023696679999999997,2,-1,1
"Glenn Beck shares buyer's remorse on Cruz endorsement Glenn Beck, a former Ted Cruz surrogate, suggested Monday thathe have been better off backing Marco Rubio in the Republican presidential primary and laced into the Texas senator for throwing his support behind Donald Trump late last week. ?For the very first time, I heard Ted Cruz calculate, and when that happened, the whole thing fell apart for me, andit my fault,? Beck said on his radio show. Story Continued Below ?It?s my fault,? Beck continued. ?I should have said: ?You know who can win? You know who could beat Hillary Clinton? Marco Rubio, and I disagree with him on the Gang of Eight, andthere about 80 percent that I do agree with him on, andhe kind of a politician, buthe a different kind of politician.He a young politician.He a Hispanic, He can win.Let go for it.?"" Instead, Beck sought ?a truly honorable man? in Cruz ? ?and that will always let you down,? he said. But while lamenting the fact that Cruz chose to be a politician Friday, Beck said that he believes the Texas firebrand is still a good man. ?I?m not gonna condemn him. He is still, I believe, a good man,? Beck said. ?He is just a politician first.I never put him into the category of a politician, andthat my fault. He is a politician.? For his part, Cruz insisted to Beck Monday that he was trying to show the Trump campaign how to earn his vote with his floor speech at the Republican National Convention in which he encouraged Republicans to vote their conscience in November. After Beck noted that Cruz failed to answer a question this past weekend about whether the real estate mogul was fit to be president, the senator explained that the presidential election is a binary choice, a conclusion he reached after whittling down five possible options (Vote for Trump, for Clinton, a third-party candidate, write in a candidate or abstain). ?So a man who has principles who says there are lines I will not cross ?it still a binary choice, so a man who you cannot come on and say, ?Yes, Glenn, he is fit to be president of the United States,? I still am encouraged by you to abandon my principles and vote becauseit a binary choice?? Beck asked. ?You are encouraged by me to do what you believe is right and honorable in principle,? Cruz shot back, warning of the damage he said Clinton would do to America. Beck, however,wasn satisfied. ?This is information that you had in Cleveland ? and hang on just a second before you respond ? you had all of this information. You had this information the day you dropped out of the race and said that Donald Trump is a sociopathic liar,? Beck said. ?So you had all this information. Have you spent an enormous amount of time with Donald Trump? Do you have new information that has made you say: ?Oh, my gosh,he now not a sociopathic liar. He is not the guy I very eloquently spelled out for over a year, and now suddenlythere a reason to believe him.?? Despite his ?significant disagreements? with Trump, Cruz said,it a binary choice. ?I?m asking for new information.I asking you for new information,? Beck said. ?You knew all the things thatyou saying today. The time to do that would have been the day you pulled out or the day that you gave the speech so eloquently. Why now?What new?? Cruz pointed to the Trumpcampaign release of possible conservative Supreme Court nominees, a list that includes Cruz ally Utah Sen. Mike Lee. He suggested he had a hand in the list, noting that the Supreme Court was an issue he raised with vice presidential nominee Mike Pence when he asked the Texas senator what it would take to get him on board. ?We discussed the Supreme Court as being one of the great checks protecting the Constitution and the rule of law, and the Trump campaign committing to nominate from that list was an important change that gave me significant reassurance that helped me get to the point of saying yes,? Cruz said. After Stu Burguiere pressed Cruz on why he would believe anything Trump says, he rattled off a series of principles at stake. ?Now, with respect to the justices Donald Trump would nominate, I know that he is publicly committing to nominate from a list that is very strong, and if he were to nominate from that list, it would be a major step towards protecting our rights,? Cruz said. ?I hope that he would follow through on that commitment. One never knows if one will, but the fact that he is public promising ?I will nominate from these 21,? I think creates a dynamic where, compared to Hillary, who is promising to put left-wing ideologues,that a clear choice.? Cruz also disagreed with the wide interpretation that his RNC remarks were a swipe against Trump, adding thathe always been ?Never Hillary? but not ever ?Never Trump.? He also said he gleaned parts of his speech from what Ronald Reagan said about Gerald Ford and what Ted Kennedy said about Jimmy Carter. ?My speech drew deliberately from both of those speeches,? Cruz said. ?Both of those speeches at the time were treated effectively as endorsement speeches. One of the unfortunate things about the reaction is Cleveland is that for many who were watching, it was perceived that I was essentially embracing Never Trump. I have never been a Never Trumper.? AfterCruz appearance, Beck said Cruz would have been better of just telling the truth about why he backed Trump. ?He could have come on and said, ?Look, guys,here the thing, my supporters are yelling at me,? and I know that, because so are mine,? he said. ??My donors, who are all in with the GOP,they all sayingI never fund ? Iwon fund you for the Senate. Iwon fund you for the run in 2020. And I have to make a decision. So the question is do I completely shut myself out of this game or do I play the game as much as I possibly can???",0.050684932,0.010958903999999998,0.009589041,0.017808219,0.08493150699999999,0.278082192,0.0013698629999999998,2,-1,1
"New Clinton ad highlights Trump's insults toward women A new Hillary Clinton ad uses DonaldTrump past words about women against him, asking voters if the Manhattan billionaire is ?the president we want for our daughters?? ?I?d look her right in that ugly face of hers,? Trump says in the ad as video of young girls looking in the mirror plays over his voice. Cutting together previous comments from the reality TV star, the 30-second advertisement quotes Trump describing one woman as a ?a fat slob? and eating ?like a pig.? Story Continued Below Trump has struggled throughout his campaign to connect with women across the country thanks, at least in part, to his comments he has made about them before entering the political world. His attempts at appealing to female voters, including a proposal for six weeks of family leave for women, have been met with mixed reviews. A McClatchy-Marist poll released Friday shows Clinton with a 24-point lead over Trump among likely female voters, 58 percent to 34 percent. ?A personwho flat-chested is very hard for them to be a 10,? Trump says in the ad, which goes on to include a quote from a 2013 interview with Howard Stern in which the GOP nominee discussed celebrity Kim Kardashian. ?Does she have a good body? No. Does she have a fat ass? Absolutely,? Trump says. The ad finishes by quoting Trump from another appearance onStern radio show in 1993.

"Trump supporters not only come in all shapes, colors, and sizes, they come from all around, even outside the United States. At Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta ?that in Canada for those of our readers who are Gary Johnson supporters?(just kidding!) ? student Matt Linder was wearing a red Trump hat with thecampaign slogan ?Make America Great Again? on the front. Even thoughthey Canadian, he and his friend both happen to be very interested in American politics, and are both supporters of Donald Trump. But other students felt their safe space severely violated by this red hat, with one Zoe Slusar demanding that he remove it, because ?it?s hate language on campus.? Heat Street reported on the incident: ?You?re not allowed to share hate language at a University,? Slusar shouted at Linder. ?Make America Great Again means Make America all for white people, no immigrants, no people of different sexual orientations. ?You?ve got to take the hat off or I am going to write the president of the University,? she continues. ?It?s not allowed.It hate language on campus.? [?] The video ends when another man (presumably a student) snatches the hat fromLinder head and absconds with it. Slusar left this description on her Facebook page, but it has since been deleted: Today I got into an altercation with a guy wearing a ?Make America Great Again? hat. I went up and asked him if he would take the hat off, explaining a university should be a safe space. It was impossible to communicate to him why wearing a hat in support of a movement grown on the seeds of racism, bigotry and exclusion of diversity (sexual and cultural) could make some people afraid. People came out of the woodwork around us to support the hat, and after insulting me, they began filming my crazybehaviour at asking him to not wear the hat on campus. The video was posted and I made the mistake of reading the comments. I am so deeply saddened? Idon want to draw anymore attention to the dysfunctional pawns that are being used by a system of power to oppress others. I do want to state that I stand by my belief that every space, but especially university spaces, should be made to make everyone feel SAFE. We need to seriously change our culture. We need to equally support and express movements and gestures of inclusive acceptance. I walked outside after the altercation, which ended up involving security and more concern forsomeone ?private property? then about anti-oppression and overt racism, feeling totally hopeless. Only to find the anti-abortion group posing with their graphic images and slogans of ?sin?. But? Beside them was a group of courageous and beautiful humans, holding signs of ?we support your choice? and kindly warning oncoming students about the graphic images so they could be avoided. (Thank you Aalayna Spence, Nathan Lawley and crew.) It makes me cry that there will always be battles of rightand ?wrong?? There will always be opposing parties? Unfortunately for many people life does not exist without fear of oppression, violence or attack. But there are some warriors, who are not too tired. Some humans who want anyone being attacked (be it blatant or subtle) to know they are equally being a supported.I ready to make some noise YYC.I ready for some LOUD AF language of LOVE. That is the only thing that might have a chance of helping the world. So be a warrior and express your support for those who are attacked everyday because of who they are. #peace She seems to be a walking contradiction. She wants everyone to ?be a warrior and express your support for those who are attacked everyday because of who they are.? Butthat exactly what she did to the Trump supporter student. She attacked him, because of who he was. And not only that, she attacked him based on stereotypes created by the media of Trump and his supporters.

"Cadets vote at a polling station. Vladimir Putin's United Russia party won a greater share of the vote than in 2011, with even less space in parliament for any real opposition party | Vasily Batanov/AFP via Getty ImagesRussia election: Free sausages and fraud allegations VladimirPutin United Russia is the big winner with a constitutional majority. MOSCOW ? Two years of economic recession, Western sanctions and wars in Ukraine and Syriahaven shaken VladimirPutin grip on power. Instead,Sunday election to the Russian state Duma saw thepresident United Russia party win a greater share of the vote than in 2011, with even less space in parliament for any real opposition party. There was never any doubt about the outcome, and many Russiansdidn bother to turn out. Nationwide, only 48 percent voted compared to 60 percent in the previous elections for the lower house of parliament. The numbers were even worse in Moscow and St. Petersburg, bastions of the educated middle classes and traditionally more protest-oriented. This time, despite some reports of voter fraud, there were no signs of demonstrations. ?They did everything [so] that people would ignore the elections, from holding them just after the summer break, to the most low-key election campaign I can remember,? said political expert Grigorii Golosov. On Monday, with 93 percent of the votes counted, United Russia had 54.2 percent of the vote, up from 49.3 percent five years ago.Russia new electoral system, a mix of party lists and single mandate districts, means thatPutin party wins a huge constitutional majority of 343 seats in the 450-seat Duma ? compared to 238 seats in 2011. With its super majority, United Russia will have free rein over parliament, dropping the need to bargain with friendly opposition parties. It can also change the constitution at will. In southern Russia a CCTV camera caught a polling official stuffing a ballot box. On the latest figures, the Communist Party will likely finish second, slightly ahead of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, with the center-left Just Russia fourth. They were all in the previous parliament, and traditionally support the government on many issues and refrain from attacking Putin. While there is some pressure for the Communists to be more independent? their leader Gennady Zyuganov at one point refused to recognize the results ? all three can be expected to remain loyal. All in all, it was a terrible election forRussia liberal fringe, which now faces the prospect of obliteration.They down from one seat in the previous Duma to none. Their best hope, the liberal opposition Yabloko party, scored less than 2 percent of the vote, and will now lose out on government funding. The liberal-democratic PARNAS party failed to get 1 percent, and most of the candidates supported by exiled oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky were wiped out. The centrist opposition also failed to break through in any of the single-mandate districts. The closest candidate,Yabloko Dmitry Gudkov, lost in the Moscow suburbs. As he faced defeat, Gudkov told POLITICO he had battled the full might of the government machine, but said that the result was ultimately down to the passivity of Russian democrats. ?Votersdidn turn up,? he said. ?Russia?s middle class now is about to get what it deserves.? Only one independent and two right-wing populist candidates made it into the Duma, but theywon give much support to the liberal opposition. One of the nationalist winners of the single-mandate run-offs was Vitaly Milonov, a former deputy of the St. Petersburg city government who has campaigned on an anti-gay rights platform. A questionable poll Although the outcome was never in doubt, the Kremlin made sure that the voting procedure was cleaned up from 2011, when voter fraud sparked anti-Putin protests. However, there were still questionable incidents, the most obvious being in Rostov in southern Russia where a CCTV camera caught a polling official stuffing a ballot box. In other places, voters were lured to the polls with free sausages and other goodies. Denis Korotkov, a correspondent for the St. Petersburg news portal Fontanka, managed to vote several times. He immediately wrote about the incident and brought it to the attention of the authorities. Law enforcement subsequently detained Korotkov ? who is now threatened with prosecution for electoral violations. While the opposition faces being wiped out, the upshot for Putin is that his control of Russia is stronger than ever. He is likely to decide to run for a fourth term as president in 2018. As part of the preparations for yet another run, Putin recently reshuffled his closest advisers, weeding out those who might dare to challenge him and replacing them with lesser-known men completely dependent on his favor. The election also means there is likely to be little change inRussia policies on Ukraine and Syria, or in its economic program. ?In practical terms, little will change with the new parliament,? wrote Capital Economics, an analysis firm, in a post-election note. ?United Russia already held a majority in parliament, anddidn face effective opposition. The strong showing for United Russia (and disappointing results for the opposition) suggests that the direction of policy will be largely unchanged.?

"What you are about to see is disturbing. Keith Lamont Scott, the man killed by police in Charlotte, North Carolina had an awesome wife of 20 years who narrated and recorded the final tragic moments of his life. Mr. Scott suffered from a traumatic brain injury, and his wife repeatedly told the police this information in the minutes prior to the shooting. She also told them that he had no weapon, and that he had just taken his medication. Of course, the cops just kept shouting at the man to drop the gun that hedidn have, before taking his life for no reason. Well, thecat out of the bag now. NBC News has the video, so, despite the fact that the cops and the City of Charlotte have been refusing to take thepublic demands for transparency seriously, the information is now out there thanks to the bravery of Mrs. Scott. Here is the news report, via NBC: These cops have a whole hell of a lot of explaining to do on this one. They better release whatever information they have, and they better not try any funny business with cover-ups. This is a damning, disturbing, and heartbreaking video of yet another senseless death of a black man in America at the hands of the system that is supposed to serve and protect. At this point, there is just absolutely no reason to trust the police, period. They are clearly killing people with impunity and without consequence. The public is aware now, so somebody better be held accountable, or there will continue to be unrest, and more matches thrown on a powder keg that is surely soon to blow sky high.

"AP Photo Backtalk Robert Kennedy Would Have Hated Donald Trump The GOP candidate is not the man of peace my former colleague makes him out to be. Writing as a former legislative assistant to Senator Robert F. Kennedy and an enthusiastic supporter of Hillary Clinton for president, I was disappointed to see in Politico the screed written by my former colleague, Adam Walinsky, excoriatingClinton record on foreign policy and national security and going on to conclude that Donald Trump should therefore be elected president. It is one thing to disagree with Secretary Clinton, which Walinsky does heatedly, and quite another to turn to Donald Trump. We should be clear thatWalinsky critique is not confined to Clinton. He lays out (and massively overstates) a dark view not just of Clinton but also of President Obama and almost the entire Democratic Party. The analysis is overwrought, but even one who buys the argument defies all logic in imagining that the solution is Trump. Story Continued Below The question is not whether there is a military-industrial complex in our country. President Eisenhower called us out on that and there is enough responsibility to go around among both parties for it. The 21st century version begins with the Iraq War, which was originated by a Republican President. I am not interested in adjudicating the issue of which party is the war party except to say that Presidents Obama, Clinton and Carter have stood for peace in important and tangible ways. The question here is whether Donald Trump can claim in any way that he is the candidate who stands for a foreign policy of restraint and the answer is that he cannot. Walinsky finds in Trump a rationality and consistency that do not exist. Any reasonable observer of the presidential campaign has seen that at one moment, Trump will represent himself as an isolationist who wants to end ties with NATO and other allies; at another, he will lash out at any perceived insult to the U.S. or to himself, and pledges thatAmerica pride needs to be vindicated militarily. ?America First,? Trump says regularly, bringing the isolationism of Charles Lindbergh tomind excoriating President Obama for not using greater force in any number of venues and then insinuating that he has a secret plan to obliterate the Islamic State. To compare John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy to Donald Trumpis, Iwon finish the sentence. Yes, Robert Kennedy turned against the Vietnam War, but not because he felt that America should retreat from the world. He opposed the war because it was unjust and was based on a flawed notion of American interests. The result, as we know, was the death of Vietnamese and Americans and others who should not have died. JFK and RFK were internationalists. They understood that World War II left the United States with a responsibility to play an active and constructive role in the world. They understood that America must stand together and dependably with allies who also are committed to pursue a peaceful world. They understood that the use of force was sometimes necessary and that brave men and women would be put at risk. They made those difficult, often excruciating, decisions carefully and as transparently as possible, never rashly, impulsively, or vindictively. Walinsky quotes RobertKennedy statement that if any member of the ExComm other than John F. Kennedy had been president during the Cuban Missile Crisis, we would have had a nuclear war. Ask yourself what a President Trump might have done in that moment. Restraintis not the word that comes to mind. This is a man who said he would order the military to kill the families of Muslim terrorists and use interrogation techniques worse than waterboarding and opined that the United States should have seizedIraq oil resources as ?spoils to the victor.? Yes, we have put too much power in the hands of militarists and profit seekers in both the public and private sectors. But electing Donald Trump is not the answer; it would only compound the problem in new and dangerous ways. The answer is an active citizenry that speaks out against the inappropriate use of force and opposes interference in conflicts that involve neither American security interests nor egregious human rightsviolations topic in which Donald Trump has shown an ostentatious indifference, as his fondness for Vladimir Putin reflects. All the evidence, provided again and again by DonaldTrump own mouth, tells us not that he is a man of peace, but that he is a man of noprinciple man who will say, and possibly do, whatever happens to cross his mind at a given minute. He is like the weather in New England: If youdon like it, wait a minute. We do not know what he believes because he does not know what he believes. We do not know what he knows because, from all we can see, he does not know much. Even ifWalinsky diatribe is correct, which it most certainly is not in its breadth and depth, there is nothing in it that justifies turning to Donald Trump. Of all occasions to break ranks with the Democratic Party, this is the most inappropriate. Of all the ways to misappropriate the memory of John and Robert Kennedy, two of our greatest public servants, this is the most egregious I have ever seen. To say that I am disappointed by what Walinsky has done is an understatement. America, in this election, faces an existentialquestion history will judge us by our answer. Walinsky has chosen the wrong side of the struggle.

"If you want to watch a conservative throw a temper tantrum just mention slavery and grab your popcorn. Because when First Lady Michelle Obama talked about slavery and the great progress our country has made since the Civil War during an interview at the new SmithsonianInstitution National Museum of African American History and Culture, conservatives took to Twitter to whine. Mrs. Obama told Good Morning America host Robin Roberts about how she feels about visiting the museum, which opens this weekend. And one of the things that struck her the most is the fact that a lot of the history the museum presents happened during the lives of the three generations of her family who visited the museum that day. And she expressed astonishment at how fast progress has been made. ?When you think about the fact that my great-great grandfather was a slave and today I live in the White House, that progress is huge andit fast,? the First Lady said.Here the video via Twitter.

"?This Is How I Teach Freedom Of Speech? Flag Stomping Teacher Meets INSTANT JUSTICE! Our Constitution protects the right of people to disrespect this nation.It despicable, but such policies help preserve the very foundation of freedom in America. However, nowhere in the Constitution does it say that every action and speech is protected against consequences. Though one may not be jailed for speaking, thatdoesn mean that employers cannot dictate what speech is acceptable in the workplace. As such, one history teacher who disrespected America has discovered that while his actions did not land him in jail, he has landed in hot water. A teacher on Monday at Massey Hill Classical High School in Fayetteville, North Carolina ? home of Fort Bragg andAmerica Special Forces ? stomped on the flag to prove a point about the value of the First Amendment. Because of this, the teacher has been placed on administrative leave while the school district investigates the incident. Students reported that the teacher had attempted to burn and tear the flag before stomping on it. Several students were upset and some walked out in protest of the disgrace. ?I put it on the ground and I used my right foot and I took two steps on it, and immediately two kids get out of the room,? the teacher, Lee Francis, stated. ? 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now Francis was teaching about the First Amendment and specifically about Texas V. Johnson, a Supreme Court case that struck-down prohibitions on flag desecration. ?But this is exactly what I teach: Youdon teach kids how to think or what to think; you teach them to go their own path,? Francis said. ?If they feel so convicted that this is their causethey going to stand for, Idon blame them.It an upper-level school for those who aspire to go to college and in that regard, we have rigor and expectations, so I treat them as such.? ?Not only was the demonstration warranted and justified based on the court,it warranted and justified in the rights we have,? he continued. This is the law of the land upheld by the highest court. Freedom of speech is not just defined verbally by something you say or write down on paper, but something that can also be a physical action.? The school district has placed him on paid administrative leave as they investigate. What Francis? explanation reveals, however, is that he remains ignorant about the world he lives in. Just because something is legal does not mean that it is a good idea and itdoesn mean that the legal act is not deeply offensive to some or downright inappropriate. If Francis wished to teach about Texas v. Johnson, he should have done so the way countless other teachers have done: by explaining it. Acting-out the provocative action is not necessary and unnecessarily hurtful to members of the fiercely-patriotic Fayetteville community.

"The recent connected bombings in New York and New Jersey and the stabbing attack at a mall in Minnesota have increased interest in how the presidential candidates would handle national security. Interested in Elections? Add Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have spoken out since the attacks, which left dozens of people injured. John Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security, said he believes that the terrorist attacks that have occurred during the campaign ""have a significant impact"" on voters. ""When events occur like this ... you tend to have people become more fearful, and when people are more fearful, they tend to gravitate towards a candidate who appears to be more strong,"" said Cohen, who currently works as an ABC News consultant. Three of the latest national polls ? all conducted before the attacks this weekend ? had Clinton leading when respondents were asked whom they trust to handle the issue of terrorism. In an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Sept. 11, Clinton led, 50 percent to Trump's 41 percent among all adults and 48 percent to Trump's 45 percent among likely voters when asked about who was more trusted to handle terrorism. A CBS/New York Times poll released Sept. 14 had Clinton doing ""a better job handling terrorism and national security"" according to 49 percent of respondents, compared with Trump's 45 percent. The split was closest in a Quinnipiac poll released Sept. 15, in which respondents were asked who they thought would do a better job keeping the country safe from terrorism, ""regardless of how you intend to vote."" In that poll, Clinton got 49 percent to Trump's 47 percent. ""Traditionally, it's been the Republican Party who has projected strength and awareness in the area of law enforcement and homeland security, but today that's kind of flipped because, despite his rhetoric, there are a number of national security experts who have raised concerns about the level of understanding that Donald Trump has as it relates to terrorism and national security threats,"" Cohen said. Andres Kudacki/AP Photo Current events are factoring into the political campaigns, with the candidates scheduling speeches about national security in the wake of attacks. But Cohen said political rhetoric could also be affecting and even motivating the attacks themselves. He said Trump's rhetoric and calls to bar foreign Muslims from entering the United States ""may even serve to further along those who are becoming inspired to act on [ISIS'] behalf."" James Campbell, a professor of political science at the University at Buffalo in New York who has written a book about political polarization, told ABC News that he believes the attacks translate to a potential advantage for Trump. ""I have to think that terrorist events in this country help Trump and hurt Clinton. For these events to be occurring with the frequency they do may be read by many as a failure of the current administration and particularly its foreign policy team to effectively deal with the problem,"" he said. ""It may also suggest that we need a tougher approach to dealing with terrorism, an approach associated with Trump. When suspects are identified who have Muslim-sounding names, then that may further fuel support for tougher immigration standards and scrutiny,"" Campbell added.",0.030456853,0.0,0.0050761420000000005,0.025380711,0.060913706,0.32741116800000003,0.02284264,2,-1,1

Based on the new information, investigators now believe Rahami went back to his family's Elizabeth, New Jersey home after the Chelsea bombings and was seen there by his family. In law enforcement interviews with family members, Rahami was described as behaving normally. According to the officials, his return home appears to be in a time period before Rahami was publicly identified as a suspect in the bombings. The federal complaint filed against Rahami describes how he came to Manhattan about two hours before the first blast on West 23rd Street in Chelsea, but does not explain a three-hour gap from then to when he is believed to have left the city via the Lincoln Tunnel at approximately 11:30 p.m., around the same time the NYPD and New York City mayor were hold their first news conference regarding the nights' terror.

His recent national polling average stands at 9 percent, with the most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll published over the weekend putting him at 5 percent.

In an interview on ABC News' ""This Week"" on Sunday, Johnson criticized the Commission on Presidential Debates over its formula for deciding who is included in the debates, saying that the panel is ""made up of Republicans and Democrats that just have no intention whatsoever in seeing anyone other than a Republican or Democrat on the debate stage."" Johnson's campaign is touting an online petition that has garnered over 1 million signatures in support of Johnson's inclusion in the debates.

"Story highlights Trump says the terror suspects family brought ""a lot of litigation"" against ""different people"" Rahami's family lives above First American Fried Chicken in Elizabeth, New Jersey Washington (CNN) Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he ""bets"" bombing suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami was probably not listed on a terror watch list because his family brought ""a lot of litigation"" against ""different people."" ""The guy over the chicken stand brought litigation, a lot of litigation, against different people,"" Trump told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly in an interview set to air Monday. ""I'll bet you that's why he was on no list. He was on no list they probably didn't want to put him on because they didn't want to get sued. They probably saw he was a litigious guy and they don't want to get sued so they left him alone."" Rahami, who is suspected in Saturday's bombings in New York City and Seaside Park, New Jersey, was captured on Monday after a manhunt and shootout. He is also believed to be connected to pipe bombs found Sunday night in Elizabeth, New Jersey, sources told CNN. Rahami's family lives above First American Fried Chicken in Elizabeth, according to the city's mayor, Chris Bollwage.

"Jill Stein is a Harvard-trained internist, a doctor who diagnosed thousands of patients for a quarter-century in Boston and Chicago before making the late-career switch to Green Party presidential candidate and could-be Hillary Clinton spoiler. So, as we settled in for our ?Off Message? podcast interview last week in a drab hotel conference room in Baltimore (she had a rally there last Friday), I asked Stein ? as a clinician used to making snap assessments ? whether she agreed that Donald Trump ?will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,? as declared by the GOPnominee Bruce Vilanch-esque personal physician Harold Bornstein. Story Continued Below ?You know, Idon pretend to be able to do TV diagnosis, but I think the guy has a problem,? said the 66-year-old candidate, who is averaging somewhere between 2 percent and 5 percent in most national and state polls, enough (Clinton people say) to put a scare into the Democrat in too-close-to-call states. ?The guy has a lot of problems ? physical, mental, emotional, cognitive,? Stein said of Trump. As proof of his (alleged) pathology, she pointed to his position-hopping on a range of issues, which she cast as erratic rather than calculating ? from his fuzzy Iraq positions over the years, to his brief softeningon immigration last month, to his decision (on the day we spoke) to suddenly renounce birtherism after five years of banging a drumbeat of lies. ?It?s hard to, you know, to think too hard about anything Donald Trump says because he will change his mind in the next hour, if not the next day, or whatever,? she added. ?Today, suddenly, after five years, he became convinced thatit not an issue. Yesterday it was an issue. It will probably become an issue again for him. You know, the guy may have a memory problem. Who knows what it is? Buthe incapable of having a consistent thought or policy.? Stein also thinksTrump getting a free pass because he spent his career in private business, and she wants him to release his tax returns. (She wants everybody else to do the same.) ?At least with Clinton, you know, there was some degree of transparency,? she said. ?Butwhat going on with Trump, youcan even get at, and what he said was that even to clarify 15 out of these 500 deals, these are just like the most frightening mafiosos around the world.He like ?he a magnet for crime and extortion.? A veteran protester who has had brushes with the law, Stein has a bit of Carrie Nation ferocity about her, but she also has a soothing, therapeutic mien ? precisely the personyou go to if you developed an unexplained rash after chaining yourself to a fracking facility. Stein got 460,000 votes as an outsider candidate in 2012 for a left-of-left, anti-war party steeped in environmental issues, but adamantly denies any role as a spoiler. Shewon say whether she can better RalphNader 2.7 million total for the party in 2000 and generally avoids the whole Al Gore-Florida-handing-W-the-White House thing. And she claims thatshe drawing disaffected Bernie-or-Bust voters who never, ever would have voted for Clinton anyway ? many of whom might have actually voted for Trump. (I told her Idon buy that.) As much as Stein despises Trump ? and she really, really does ? she describes the choice between him and Hillary Clinton as an abominable binary offering ?death by gunshot or death by strangulation.? But her contempt has a more cutting quality when she talks about Clinton. She mocks Trump as braying menace; Stein thinkshe, at heart, a bumbler who would be neutered by his own party after being elected. Butit Clinton who poses the greater threat, inStein estimation, because she knows how to move the levers of Washington. ?Donald Trump, I think, will have a lot of trouble moving things through Congress,? Stein explains. ?Hillary Clinton, on the other hand,won. ? Hillary has the potential to do a whole lot more damage, get us into more wars faster, to pass her fracking disastrous climate program, much more easily than Donald Trump could do his.? This is a boutique opinion among mainstream liberals, to put it politely. And a lot of people, Democrats and pollsters among them, see in Stein and her more popular Libertarian counterpart Gary Johnson (whose support flirts with double digits) as potent threats to Clinton because they draw disproportionately from her potential supporters, especially among younger voters. The TBS host and satirist Samantha Bee, who makes no secret about wanting to see the first female president elected, is so infuriated with Stein she refuses to even show her picture on TV ? and encouraged Stein backers to mail their complaints to her vagina, though she used a different word. Stein is used to this kind of thing and believes she is taking one for the lefty team. Earlier this year, she hinted about dropping out if Sanders stayed in and still pines a bit for the Hillary-backing Vermont socialist. ?I?ve tried to talk with Bernie, but, you know, Bernie is ? he is a team player,? she said, lamenting his refusal to even chat with her. ?I thinkhe on the wrong team, perhaps becausehe been in Washington, D.C., too long, because he used to really understand independent politics and why we cannot have a viable political system unless we have independent political parties. ? Maybeit a generational thing.? Sanders, stumping for Clinton over the weekend, dismissed Stein and Johnson as a self-defeating ?protest vote? butthere more than a little truth to her argument that third-party candidates will lure voters away from the Democratic nominee, with some polls showing a quarter to a third of under-30 voters opting for Stein, Johnson or none of the above. ?The millennial problem is real,? a senior Clinton aide recently told me. ?Itshouldn be overstated, but we have work to do.? Like Sanders, Stein has an affection for Russia and a soft spot for Botox strongman Vladimir Putin. Critics like Clinton ally Neera Tanden have noted just how often Stein appears on the Putin-controlled cable network RT. And a gushing video Stein recorded after her appearance at a democracy conference in Moscow earlier this year sparked all sorts of speculation on the part of Team Clinton about a broader Cyrillic conspiracy to undermine the Democratic nominee that included Trump, his former aide Paul Manafort and Hillary-hating WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, whom Stein has spoken about in heroic terms. When I asked her whether Putin is a despot, I got a yes-and-no answer, with traces of Trumpian ambivalence. ?To some extent, yes, but there could be a whole lot worse,? Stein said when I asked about the reportedly rigged Russian elections this year. ?When we needlessly provoke him and endanger him and surround him with war games ? this is sort of the Cuban missile crisis on steroids ? and Idon think this is a good idea.? Moreover, shedoesn think Russia was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee email system or that Putin is trying to sway the election inTrump favor ? despite U.S. officials? claims to the contrary and media reports that the Russian president is hell-bent on seeing Clinton defeated. ?Idon think we have evidence ? there is really no hard evidence? ofPutin meddling, she said. ?We need to take a deep breath on this. This reallydoesn seem to be happening.? The other controversy ensnaring Stein is questions over her commitment to vaccinations, after comments she made earlier this year expressing sharp skepticism about the Food and Drug Administration and its willingness to buck corporate interests to produce safe formulations. On this topic she is less equivocal, and says she sees zero link between autism and vaccinations, although she remains concerned about the developmental impact of chemicals included in shots given to small children. Stein is extremely fastidious about her health (she sipped on an organic berry smoothie before our talk) and is acutely conscious of the environment, and not only in the abstract sense. At one point during our chat, after a bout of coughing, she pointed to the well-worn hotel carpet and told me the chemicals used to cover up the dirt are so toxic she spreads sheets on the floor every timeshe in a big-chain hotel. She is an ex-marathoner who clears her email inbox every morning during a brisk six-mile walk and has no detectable body fat. Thus, it is one of the small jokes in a big-joke 2016 that both Stein and Johnson are ultra-buff exercise freaks who are in far better shape than the puffier major-party candidates. As we were discussing Trump andClinton duelingdoctor notes, she offered the following declaration: ?I am healthy, yes. I assume I have the lowest blood pressure of any candidate,? she said running a long finger down the medical office-type clipboard, stuffed with clips and talking points, that she totes everywhere. Cool. Trust but verify. Clinton provided her numbers ? could she produce hers? ?Last I recall it was around 110/70,? Stein said. ?I?m sorry. Hillary Clinton has a 100/70,? I said. A few minutes into the podcast, an aide had handed Stein a note informing her she had (as expected) been locked out of the debates, and she responded with a smiling shrug. The blood-pressure revelation elicited a graver response. ?Are you serious?? Stein said, pausing ? before offering Clinton a challenge. ?Man. ? Well, I would be happy to run a race with her anytime.?",0.032085561,0.012477718,0.006238859,0.01426025,0.059714795,0.24777183600000002,0.001782531,2,-1,1
"Anyone watching Mondaynight highly charged presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump knows that Hillary cleanedTrump clock. Of course,Trump ego will never let him admit that he lost to Hillary, so his surrogates are already being deployed all over the place to spin his embarrassingly terrible debate performance into something positive. The verbal gymnastics there are astounding, but of course these people are Donald Trump surrogates, so they are used to spinning faster than the head of the girl in The Exorcist. One Trump surrogate, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, is taking things a step further, though, and trying to float the idea that Trump should refuse to do future debates with Hillary. Of course, this is just a cowardly move because ofTrump abysmal performance. But Giuliani is the Trump Spinner-in-Chief, and instead decided to blame the fact that NBC moderator Lester Holt actually called Trump out on his lies on his suggestion that Trump should skip out next time. Giuliani whined thatHolt fact-checking was unfair treatment of Trump, and therefore if it were him, hewouldn debate again without certain petty, childish demands being met: ?If I were Donald Trump, Iwouldn participate in another debate unless I was promised the journalist would act like a journalist, and not an ignorant fact check. My advice would be the moderator would have to promisethey be a moderator.? When pressed, Giuliani refused to say whether or not he would advise Trump to find a way out of debating Hillary again, only that if it were him, it is what he would do. This is in direct contrast withTrump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who insists Trump will do both future debates. While both candidates had nothing but good things to say aboutHolt moderation, Giuliani lit into Holt regarding the stop and frisk question, saying that themoderator ?interference?regarding the controversial policy and its effects on New York City was ?outrageous.? However, considering that Trump has floated the idea of a nationwide stop and frisk policy, the discussion on that subject and its racist implementation was perfectly reasonable. Thatdidn stop Giuliani from outright lying in his rant, though, when he said: ?If journalism has ethics, Lester Holt unethically interfering in the area of law he knows nothing about. It is not unconstitutional andTrump description of that case was correct.? But, again, this is a lie ? a federal judge definitely ruled the policy unconstitutional. At the end of the day,Giuliani tantrum is only because he wants his candidate to be able to lie with impunity in front of millions, because most Trump voters are low information plebes, or they simplydon care aboutTrump bigotry, lies, incompetence, and just general all-around douchebaggery. However, if he gets called out on a debate stage, it makes him look like a fool to undecided voters, who are much more likely to vote for Hillary if they are going to leave third-party camps. If Trump drops out of future debates, he and his surrogates will blame Lester Holt, the so-called liberalmedia, and anyone and anything besides Trump himself. Rudy Giuliani is just laying the groundwork for that right now.

"2016 Clinton vs. Trump: The only 30 minutes that matter Most of the big debate moments in history came in theencounter opening rounds, something Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton would do well to remember. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will debate for 90 minutes on Monday. But the winner likely will be determined in the first half-hour.That when Al Gore first sighed, Mitt Romney knocked President Barack Obama on his heels, and Marco Rubio, earlier this year, glitched in repeating the same talking point ? over and over and over.It when Gore tried, unsuccessfully, to invade George W.Bush space, Richard Nixon was first caught wiping away sweat with a handkerchief (during the moderators? introductions!) and Gerald Ford in 1976 made the ill-advised declaration that, ?There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.? Story Continued Below Veteran presidential debate coaches and campaign strategists say the tone and trajectory of general election debates have long been set in their opening minutes, and that the explosion of real-time spin and Twitter groupthink has only accelerated the trend. And so, as Clinton and Trump square off Monday at Hofstra University before a national audience that is expected to shatter viewership records, the pressure will be especially intense right at the start. ?You have your maximum audience at its most impressionable stage in the first minutes of the debate,? said Mari Maseng Will, a veteran Republican debate coach who served as communications director in the Reagan White House. Campaigns now specially design one-liners for those crucial opening minutes and map out plans to pivot to safer ground if the early questioning veers into rockier political terrain, such as, say, classified emails for Clinton or charges of misogyny for Trump. In a sign of the warp speed in which debate storylines can form, BuzzFeed in 2012 famously posted a story with the headline, ""How Mitt Romney Won the First Debate,"" only 42 minutes into the first Obama-Romney clash in Denver. Kevin Madden, then a senior Romney adviser, said the campaign could see the conventional wisdom hardening among the chattering class online in real time. ?It was clear Romney was going to be declared the winner no matter what happened in the other 60 minutes, barring any big mistakes,? Madden said. (Romney fell victim to this, too, when he spent the first half of his final encounter largely agreeing with Obama and was portrayed as overly ?passive.?) Debate pros, much like courtroom lawyers, have a name for this: ?the primacy effect.?It the idea that whatever is heard first is likely to be what is best remembered. ?In debates and in trial work,there the doctrine of primacy,? said Judd Gregg, who played Gore inBush mock debate preparations in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004. ?If you do a good job ? or a really bad job ? it will stay with the viewer.? How long, exactly, Clinton and Trump have to form that first impression is the subject of, well, some debate. Todd Graham, a presidential debate junkie and director of debate at Southern Illinois University, where his teams have won five national championships, estimated that candidates have about 45 minutes. ?The first half of the debate is absolutely the most important,? Graham said. Examples are plentiful.Reagan classic 1984 line, ?I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience,? came just before the halfway point. In 2000, Gore began making off-camera sighs and split-screen smirks in the opening minutes of the first general election debate, expressions of exasperation that would come to define his bouts with Bush. Bush, meanwhile, quickly landed lines aboutGore ?phony numbers? and, later, ?fuzzy math? that would be endlessly repeated. Then, early in their third debate, Gore physically approached Bush in an act of intimidation that backfired at the town-hall style debate. Bush glanced over and gave Gore a quick, dismissive nod that drew laughs from the crowd as Gore gamely still tried to corner Bush on obscure specifics. ?What about the Dingle-Norwood bill?? Gore demanded, before eventually retreating to his chair. Bush never answered. Hedidn need to. The early minutes proved critical in some of thisyear primary debates, too. In February, ChrisChristie campaign-crushing retort toRubio repeating of a talking point ? ?There it is. The memorized 25-second speech. There it is, everybody? ? came fewer than 20 minutes into the two-hour debate. Rubio never recovered that night, or the rest of the campaign. Curt Anderson, chief strategist for Bobby Jindal, who appeared in the so-called undercard debates, said the bias toward the beginning was striking. ?There?s this whole Twitterverse dynamic whereit decided in the opening minutes.It not rational or fair, and you can bitch all you want about it, but you have to adjust and deal with it,? he said. By the end,Jindal team designed its debate strategy around landing its weightiest punches early. In the most extreme of cases, an entiredebate storyline can be sealed after a single question. In 1988, the very first question asked of Michael Dukakis was whether he would support the death penalty if his wife were ?raped and murdered.? Without any visible emotion, he said he would not. (?When he answered by talking policy, I knew we had lost the election,? Dukakis? campaign manager would later say.) In 2012, BuzzFeed famously posted a story with the headline, ""How Mitt Romney Won the First Debate,"" only 42 minutes into the first Obama-Romney clash in Denver. | Getty In the 2012 primaries, CNN opened a debate by asking Newt Gingrich about allegations that he had once wanted an open marriage. ?I think the destructive, vicious, negative nature of much of the news media makes it harder to govern this country, harder to attract decent people to run for public office. And I am appalled that you would begin a presidential debate on a topic like that,? Gingrich bellowed to thunderous applause. Two days later, Gingrich, who had been left for dead politically after losing Iowa and New Hampshire, won the South Carolina primary. There are other practical reasons why early minutes matter most: Voters can change the channel, and reporters have to start crafting their stories. ?Reporters are lazy, and they have deadlines, and those two things combined ? theydon have all night,? said Graham, who said he watches and reads post-game punditry and ?95 percent of people are talking about what happened in the first 45 minutes.? In 2012, Rentrak, which tracks television viewership, found that the average home watched only two-thirds of the first debate, though there was no precipitous drop-off over time. But by the third debate, the company reported ?the audience justdidn stay tuned in as long.? There have been key moments late in presidential debates, or course.Reagan ?There you go again? quip to Jimmy Carter in 1980 came late. George H.W. Bush glanced down at his watch when, deep into a 1992 debate, a voter was asking him a question. And LloydBentsen infamous slapdown of Dan Quayle ? ?I knew Jack Kennedy, Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy? ? came in the waning minutes of the 1988 vice-presidential debate. Richard Nixon wipes his face during the nationally televised debate broadcast from a studio in New York City on Oct. 21,1960. | AP Photo WithTrump general unpredictability and his reported disdain for full 90-minute dress rehearsals at a lectern, he certainly could tire, slump or lash out late. Notably, Trump never debated one-on-one in the primary, and all those contests included commercial and bathroom breaks that are absent from the formal fall debates. Meanwhile, Clinton, in a 2007 primary debate, suffered a late blow after she took two different positions on drivers? licenses for illegal immigrants in the closing minutes. ?I can't tell whether she was for it or against it,? Obama pounced. But historically, it has been the first third to half of debates that prove decisive. ?Attention spans wane,? said BrettO, a Republican debate coach who has worked with past presidential candidates, including Romney, George W. Bush and John McCain. ?They?re really set in the first 30 minutes, and you never get a second chance at a first impression.?",0.023877746000000002,0.00286533,0.00286533,0.010506208000000001,0.043935052999999995,0.220630372,0.00095511,2,-1,1

"Rudy Giuliani said Donald Trump should be himself on the debate stage. | Getty Giuliani on debate: 'He?s basically going to be Donald Trump' Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Donald Trump is going to be clearer and more precise when he steps up to the debate podium Monday night, but beyond that ?he?s basically going to be Donald Trump.? ?My advice to him, I think Donald Trump has done best since Donald Trump has been just let loose to be Donald Trump,? the frequent Trump surrogate said on ?Fox and Friends? Monday morning. ?There's a lot of discussion of, you know, how things should be scripted and I think what we've all found that are working with him now is you let him be himself, this man is an extraordinary political thinker himself and a great communicator.? Story Continued Below But like other Republicans making the rounds on TV news Monday morning, Giuliani was quick to set a higher bar for Democrat Hillary Clinton, who the former mayor said has a decided advantage over Trump. Giuliani said the Manhattan billionaire will have to work to counter the former secretary ofstate experience in government and policy expertise on the debate stage. ?She has, obviously, policy knowledge I don't have. She's been in government since I was a child. I don't remember a time she hasn't been in government in one way or another,? Giuliani said of Clinton. ?So she's going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has, but I think he's going to comport himself very, very well, and he's going to be -- he's just going to be like you see him on, when he comes here, and when you talk to him on the phone. He's going to be Donald Trump.? Giuliani dismissed concerns aboutTrump non-traditional approach to debate preparation, which has eschewed the mock debates that Clinton has used to ready herself. Giuliani said Trump has studied tapes ofClinton past debate performances as well as his own and likened the preparation to that of a boxer, suggesting that ?you get the person ready the way they want to get ready.? One issue that Giuliani said Trump is not worried about coming up at the debate is the issue of his often inaccuracy-laden campaign rhetoric. Multiple media outlets, including POLITICO, have discovered numerous lies and half-truths in fact-checkingTrump remarks, but the former New York mayor said the GOP nominee stacks up well against Clinton when it comes to truthfulness. ?I can't imagine that probably the biggest liar that ever ran for president of the United States is going to bring up lies,? he said. ?I mean, this is the womanwho lied maybe 15 different times about Benghazi and told three different stories. So I think if she wants to get to the area of lying, she's lied about things related to national security.That a topic we would love.?",0.056547619,0.005952381,0.008928571,0.008928571,0.06845238099999999,0.28571428600000004,0.0,2,-1,1
"Donald Trump has a reputation in the media for being open and accessible to interview requests. He is known for a willingness to spout off to whoever sticks a microphone in front of his face, and it has helped him get this far as a political candidate. But lately, as Trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel, he has also been in something of a retreat. That is, Trump is only talking to Fox News right now. Trump is saying yesto Fox News almost every day but saying noto most other major networks and news organizations ? a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee. He called into ?Fox & Friends? on Monday morning, he is booked on ?TheO Factor? Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday. Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits thecandidate exposure to hard-hitting questions ? while fueling frustration among journalists. At Fox News, Trump can avoid pesky follow-up questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy, long after he claims to have dropped it. Fox News hostswon ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right, rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement. At Fox News, Trumpisn challenged ? andthat the way he wants it. The problem is, wrapping up in the Fox News cocoon may feel good for the time being, but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort. Trumpisn reaching out. It is a strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign, where instead of following the model of successful politicians like George W. Bush and President Obama by holding campaign rallies in swingdistricts hoping to persuade voters, Trump has rallies with the converted. On election day in 2012, Fox News viewers were shocked to find the Romney landslidethe network had kept promoting was a harsh reality. They may be setting themselves up for a major failure.

"""He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior,"" Hillary Clinton said of Donald Trump. | Getty Clinton on Trump's birther claim: A 'racist lie' Donald Trump defended his long-running questioning of President Barack Obama's birthplace during Monday's presidential debate, while Hillary Clinton called it a ""racist lie"" that ""can't be dismissed that easily."" During a segment on racial healing, Trump repeatedly praised himself for pushing the president to produce his long-form birth certificate in 2011. The document proved Obama was born in Hawaii. Story Continued Below ""I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country but even for the president in getting him to produce his birth certificate,"" Trump said. As moderator Lester Holt tried to ask Trump what he would say to Americans worried about the racial dimensions of birtherism, Trump cut off the question and said: ""I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it."" The Republican nominee also insisted that it was Clinton associates who first tried to peddle false rumors that Obama was born in Kenya. He further pointed to Clinton's tough Democratic primary clash with Obama in the 2008 presidential race in claiming that she had treated the president with disrespect. Clinton used the exchange to raise reports of how, back in the 1970s, some of Trump's properties were sued for racial discrimination because they would not rent apartments to African Americans. ""He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one,"" Clinton said. ""Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him is that this was being touted and used against him.""

"Hillary Clinton goes on stage during the first presidential debate held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., on Sept. 26. | AP Photo The instance when decorum went south for Clinton and Trump In an exchange that began about trade and economic growth and ended with DonaldTrump claim that Clinton has been fighting the Islamic State for decades, Trump repeatedly peppered Clinton ? running through polished responses ? with interjections, a study in miniature of his disruptive challenge to her practiced presidential run. The action began when Trump said Clinton had taken 30 years in public service to begin thinking about productive solutions to thenation problems. ?Well, not quite that long,? Clinton responded. ?I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again.? Story Continued Below Trump interjected, ?He approved NAFTA which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.? Clinton continued with an extended, number-filled defense of her record on trade, touting her ability to create jobs and boost exports. Trump responded, ?Well you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or ...? ?I've been a senator and I have,? Clinton edged in. ?Youhaven done it,? Trump retorted. Clinton tried to regain her train of speech, but Trumpwouldn have it. ?Excuse me,? he shot back. ?Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.? ?Well, that's your opinion,? Clinton said. Then Trump unloaded on the decline of manufacturing, channeling the same anxiety and outrage over decay of the former backbone of the American economy that has fueled his insurgent campaign. ?You go to New England, Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton,? he said. ?And you will see devastation where manufacturing is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.? The exchange rumbled on, Trump peppering Clinton all along the way. The former secretary of state touted the virtues of her economic plan. ?But you have no plan,? Trump interjected. ?Oh, I do.? ?Secretary, you have no plan.? ?In fact, I have written a book about it. It's called ?Stronger Together.?"" ?That?s about allyou done,? Trump ribbed her. Clinton plowed through it: ?You can pick it up tomorrow at the bookstore or at an airport near you.? After Clinton urged viewers to go to her website for a real-time fact-check ofTrump claims, Trump ribbed her for publishing her plan to combat the Islamic State online. ?You go to her website ? she tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much,? he said. ?At least I have a plan to fight ISIS,? retorted Clinton, a reference to heropponent stance that discussing his plan to combat the Islamic State would only tip off the enemy and his subsequent promise to order military leaders to draw up a plan to defeat the group on his first day in office. ?No, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.? Moderator Lester Holt tried in vain to wrestle control of the exchange. ?Folks, let me --,? he began ?Go to ? please, the fact checkers, get to work,? said Clinton.",0.03652968,0.002283105,0.00456621,0.00913242,0.057077626,0.260273973,0.006849315,2,-1,1
"Paul Ryan didn't take a position on Donald Trump's proposal to expand stop-and-frisk. | AP Photo Ryan defers on Trump's 'stop-and-frisk' pitch Speaker Paul Ryan on Thursday refused to take a position on DonaldTrump controversial proposal to increase the use of stop-and-frisk tactics to reduce crime in African-American communities such as Chicago. During a Fox News town hall taped Wednesday, the real estate tycoon said law enforcement should increase its use of stop-and-frisk to curb ""black-on-black crime."" Story Continued Below ?I would do stop-and-frisk,? Trump told Sean Hannity. ?We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive.? Ryan ? who said earlier this week he hopes the House can pass criminal justice reform during the lame-duck session ? deferred when asked about Trump's statements. ?Ihaven given enough thought to it,? the Wisconsin Republican said, later adding: ?I?m not a Judiciary guy so I would defer to [Judiciary Chairman] Bob Goodlatte about the constitutionality of police tactics. Ican speak to that.? The New York City PoliceDepartment stop-and-frisk practices were ruled unconstitutional by a federal court in the summer of 2013 because they were found to be racially discriminatory. Trump's pitch came on the heels of more violence in Charlotte, North Carolina, Wednesday evening, during protests that followed the recent killings of two black men by police in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency and one civilian was reported to be on life support after being shot during a protest. On Thursday, Democrats slammed Trump's suggestion. ?Donald Trump is a national embarrassment andI looking forward to Nov. 8 when this long national nightmare will end,? Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said when asked aboutTrump stop-and-frisk idea. ?He constantly throws out things that have no basis in reality.? ?The notion that stop and frisk had anything to do with the improving public safety numbers in New York is ludicrous and Donald Trump needs to check his facts,"" Jeffries added. Another New York Democrat, Rep. Gregory Meeks, said Trump's rhetoric was really about mobilizing his base, not appealing to black voters. ?This is supposed to be his alleged roll out to get closer and get more African American votes,"" Meeks said.

"With the Hillary Clinton-Donald Trump debates upon us, the quadrennial question comes begging: Do these showdowns matter? Interested in Elections? Add Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest The chances for impact seem ripe this year. The two most unpopular major-party candidates in the history of ABC News/Washington Post polls are facing off. Donald Trump's unorthodox campaign style and provocative positions have piqued public interest; the debates may be the single best opportunity for him to allay concerns about his qualifications, temperament and policy promises alike. Hillary Clinton, for her part, needs -? like Trump -? to ease questions about her trustworthiness, as well as to spark greater enthusiasm among her supporters. Can either candidate move the needle? It will be tough: A review of data since 1960 suggests that past debates have almost never directly and measurably changed the candidates' relative standings. That's admittedly a high standard, though, and at least some debates may have had more subtle impacts. Debates have been held in 11 presidential races since 1960. We find just one after which the lead in presidential preference changed hands by a significant margin: In 1980, when Ronald Reagan uttered his ""are you better off?"" line. He gained 7 points in a post-debate poll. Still, there are other cases in which debates (or post-debate evaluations) may have influenced campaign dynamics. Debates are, after all, an essential window on the candidates? styles and grasp of the issues. They can seem to add or reverse momentum. And polls are only so precise. Consider 1960: After RichardNixon pasty-faced performance, John F. Kennedy went from 46 percent support to 49 percent in Gallup data; Nixon, from 47 percent to 46 percent. Those changes were within the polls' margin of sampling error. Nonetheless, the numerical ""lead"" switched, and collective memory maintains that the debates spelled Nixon's narrow defeat. Nor did Gallup polls show significant movement immediately after the 1976 debate in which Gerald Ford said Poland was free (and news reports pounced on the misstatement); Jimmy Carter gained a single point, Ford lost 3. Still, even if not measurably, the gaffe may have halted what had been a slide in Carter's lead. Then 73-year-old Reagan's teasing jibe in 1984 about 56-year-old Walter Mondale's ""youth and inexperience"" didn't meaningfully change the numbers in ABC News/Washington Post polls, but perhaps helped put aside questions about Reagan's age and acuity. In 2000, Al Gore's wonk-heavy performance saw him go in at +2 and leave at -3, but again, that was within sampling error. There's also the question of missed opportunities, as in Mike Dukakis' bloodless answer, in 1988, to what he'd do if his wife were raped and murdered. He didn't seize on the chance to show a non-technocratic side. And ABC/Post polls did not meaningfully move. ABC News/Washington Post polls in 1996, 2004, 2008 and 2012 also showed no significant movement around the debates. In 1992 there was more movement, including a significant gain for Ross Perot, but never enough to change BillClinton advantage. In instant reactions, at least, polling has found that debates typically reinforce preconceived notions rather than change them. Most of each candidates' supporters say it's their candidate who won, and precious few say their minds were changed. But post-debate evaluations can shift. In 1992, right after the first debate, 24 percent of viewers said Perot had won. By the next night, amid positive reviews of Perot's performance, that grew to 37 percent among people who'd watched, heard or read about it. And Perot's support did advance, from 6 percent before the debates to 17 percent after them. That shift may have been real, but it also may have reflected the challenges of immediate post-debate reaction polls. Conducted in mere minutes, among individuals pre-recruited to participate, they're subject to considerable sampling and weighting limitations. Further, some ask who ""won,"" others who ""did the better job""; some accept ""tie"" as an answer and some don't. Instant reactions also bypass the role of considered judgment. Hard as it may be to believe in the Twitter Age, sometimes people actually need a little while to think about things. The clearest response to the debates this year may take some days to emerge. Rundown Here's a rundown of the measurable debate effect (or lack thereof) in each election since 1960. There were no debates in 1964, 1968 or 1972. Click here for data tables associated with each election. 1960: Gallup had Nixon +1, but that was 12 days before the first debate; it had Kennedy +3 after it. Twelve days is a long time and 4 points is a small number. Gallup didn't poll between the remaining three debates, but showed Kennedy +4 after the last one. 1976: News reports jumped on Ford's misstatement of Soviet domination of Eastern Europe in the second debate. Carter's lead had been diminishing, and that did stop after this debate. But the measured change after the second debate was tiny -- Carter gained 1 point, Ford lost 3. 1980: This one looks to have mattered: Gallup's pre-debate poll had Carter +8; post-debate, Reagan +3. (John Anderson did not participate.) 1984: Mondale crept up, but Reagan stayed ahead by double digits nonetheless. 1988: We don't have an ABC poll done right before the first debate; in a Gallup poll it was George H. W. Bush +8. Our poll after the second debate showed no meaningful movement. 1992: Perot moved up 5 points in ABC News polling after the first debate and 4 points after the third debate. Before the debates he had 6 percent support; after the last debate he was up to 17 percent. Clinton moved up by 5 points after the second debate, Bush down by 6, then Clinton down by 6 after the third. But Clinton led throughout. 1996: The race looked perhaps slightly tighter after the second debate, but Clinton maintained a double-digit lead throughout. 2000: Gore went in +2 and came out -3 -? a change of lead, but within sampling error. And a week after the last debate it was back to a dead heat, 47-47 percent. 2004: There were some wiggles in the debate period ?- a 6-point lead for George W. Bush before the first debate was a dead heat before the third -? but when all was said and done the race after the debates looked a lot like the race before them. 2008: The main shift in vote preference came before the first debate, as Obama seized the reins of economic discontent after the failure of Lehman Brothers in mid-September. McCain's +2 in early September, just after the GOP convention, proved to be his best. The race shifted to Obama +9 in an ABC/Post poll completed Sept. 22, four days before the first debate. Obama never trailed again. 2012: Obama was +2 ahead of the first debate in ABC/Post polls, within the margin of sampling error, +3 after the second debate and -1 after the final debate, all within sampling error.",0.017817371999999998,0.0,0.001113586,0.013363028999999998,0.056792873,0.23051224899999997,0.006681514,2,-1,1
"Hillary Clinton was absolutely right to call Trump supporters deplorable and this is why. In response to the expulsion of a Kansas State University student who said it ?feels good to finally be a n*gga? in a photo of herself covered inL?al facial cleansing mask, Dell Rapids, South Dakota firefighter John Nygaard literally called for bringing back slavery and endorsed Republican nominee Donald Trump. ?Think we should make slaves again,? Nygaard wrote. ?Vote Trump! Fuck these people.?Here a screenshot of his comments via Raw Story. While that probably made Trump and his white supremacist supporters smile, the people of Dell Rapids were horrified by the remarks. ?You?re a public servant andyou putting stuff like that on Facebook,that not good,? resident William Dezee told KSFY. ?There?s enough problems going on, wedon need racial slurs or people wearing masks or saying somethingthat what 160 years old, leave it alone.That the way it should be.? The outrage was enough for the Dell Rapids Fire Rescue to boot Nygaard off the squad and he has been terminated. ?John is no longer a member of our volunteer organization,? the department said in a statement posted on Facebook. ?Dell Rapids fire would like to apologize on behalf of our former member for his insensitive and narrow minded comments on Facebook. This is something we take very seriously and this type of thinking will not be tolerated by our members.?Here the report via KSFY. People like Nygaard hurt the trust between the community and our first responders because you have to wonder if you are going to be helped or not depending on what color your skin is. A public service like fire rescue should work to help everyone regardless of race. But racists like Nygaard undermine that principle. Donald Trump has objected to his supporters being called deplorable. Well, if he reallydoesn think a racist who supports re-enslaving black people is deplorable, he has zero chance of getting a black person to vote for him, and he certainlyshouldn get anyoneelse vote either.

In addition, CNN shot down reports on Wednesday that Lewandowski was being suspended by the channel. ?Corey Lewandowski, who is no longer involved in the campaign, continues to receive monthly severance payments,? Trump press secretary Hope Hicks told The Washington Post Wednesday. ?The campaign will continue to honor its contract with Mr. Lewandowski, which stipulates he will be paid through the end of the year. These payments are in no way compensation for services rendered.? POLITICO reported on Tuesday evening that the Trump campaign had paid Lewandowski's firm $20,000 in August, according to campaign filings, for ""strategy consulting."" As The Washington Post pointed out, the description of the payment as ""strategy consulting"" appeared to contradictCNN claim that Lewandowski was being paid by the Trump campaign only for severance. Campaign employees being paid severance for so long after their departures is unusual, and it's not entirely clear why on the FEC forms the Trump campaign continues to call payments to Lewandowski as ""strategy consulting"" (we've reached out to the campaign for clarification and will update here accordingly). In an appearance on Fox News Radio, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway stressed that the payment is still part of his severance and pointed out that CNN also employs as commentators people who work for pro-Clinton Super PACs. ""He is not part of the campaign, he is a paid adviser on CNN and I think he's excellent in his job, frankly. Corey does not have a formal or informal role with the campaign whatsoever,"" Conway said. Mediaite on Wednesday reported that Lewandowski was being suspended by the channel following the new statement, but a spokesperson for the cable channel said the report was false, and that Lewandowski would be appearing on air later today. CNN President Jeff Zucker had for months defended the cablechannel decision to hire Lewandowski. On Tuesday, the cable network head said at a company town hall for staff that the network ""needed to bring in voices supportive of the Republican nominee to balance its commentary ranks,"" The Huffington Post reported. Lewandowski has signed a non-disclosure agreement with the Trump campaign, and as part of that agreement agreed to a non-disparagement clause, according to the Associated Press which extends beyond his time working for the campaign.

"The candidates are in the final stretch of the debates as the presidential campaign is on a true countdown. Interested in Elections? Add Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Some new information about the final debate was announced today, and considering the first two presidential debates of this cycle were the most viewed ever in the history of presidential debates, the third and final one could make history as well. ""I think there's going to be a lot of focus [on the debates] and they've always been a really important part of the process,"" said Peter Eyre, a senior adviser with the Commission on Presidential Debates, the independent organization that sponsors the events. Watch the third presidential debate on ABC News and ABCNews.com at 9 p.m. ET on Wednesday, Oct. 19. Here's a rundown of the debates so far and what we know about the second and third head-to-head match-ups between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. When and Where First presidential debate: Sept. 26 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. Moderator: NBC's ""Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt The debate had six segments covering different subjects, as mandated by the commission. The commission had announced that Holt selected three topics -- America's direction, achieving prosperity and securing America -- to cover during the debate, but noted that they were subject to change based on news events. Vice presidential debate: Oct. 4 at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. Moderator: CBS News correspondent Elaine Quijano The debate was set to feature nine segments, each about 10 minutes long. The topics of the debate were not announced in advance. Tim Kaine answered the first question, as a result of a coin toss. Second presidential debate: Oct. 9 at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. Moderators: ABC News' chief global affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz and CNN anchor Anderson Cooper The debate was held in a town hall format, with about half the questions asked by members of the audience and the other by the moderators. Gallup was responsible for finding the audience members, who are supposed to be uncommitted voters, the commission announced. The topics of the debate were not announced in advance. Third presidential debate: Oct. 19 at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. Moderator: ""Fox News Sunday"" anchor Chris Wallace The final debate will be in the same format as the first one. The specific topics of the debate were announced today and include debt and entitlements, immigration, the economy, the Supreme Court, foreign hot spots and fitness to be president. They are subject to change based on news events. Tasos Katopodis/AFP/Getty Images Who Will Be on Stage Much like the first presidential debate, Clinton and Trump are the only two candidates who will be on stage this Sunday. Based on the CPD's average of polls from five different national polls, Clinton has 44.8 percent of the national vote, Trump has 40.8 percent, and neither Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson nor Green Party candidate Jill Stein passed the required 15 percent threshold to be included in the debate. The averages put Johnson at 7.8 percent and Green at 2.6 percent, respectively. The commission previously announced it will use five surveys -- ABC News/Washington Post, CBS/New York Times, CNN/Opinion Research Corp., Fox News and NBC/Wall Street Journal -- to make the decision. Kaine and Pence were the only two candidates who participated in the vice presidential debate. Who Will Be in the Audience The names of any high-profile campaign guests have not yet been announced for the town hall debate. For that town hall debate, the participating audience will be anywhere in size from a couple dozen people up to as many as 100 people, with a viewing audience of about 1,000. Polling company Gallup has been tasked with finding the audience members for the participating audience, who are expected to be uncommitted voters. In the run-up to the first presidential debate, attention was paid to some of the big names who would be in the audience off-stage. Chelsea Clinton attended the debate, a first for her this election cycle after not attending any of the Democratic primary debates. And then another familiar face was present in the front row supporting Team Clinton: Mark Cuban. The billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner is a vocal Clinton supporter and reportedly went so far as to volunteer to play Trump in Clinton's mock debates. He has said the Clinton team never returned his email offer, but they did keep him in mind for another move. Just got a front row seat to watch @HillaryClinton overwhelm @realDonaldTrump at the ""Humbling at Hofstra"" on Monday. It Is On ! ? Mark Cuban (@mcuban) September 23, 2016 About 1,000 people are expected in the viewing audience at each debate, and while Eyredidn expect there to be frequent cuts to the audience by TV cameras, there is a chance that special guests sitting near the front may be seen on TV at some point. The audience will be a mix of guests of the universities, guests of the campaigns and ""others who have made the debates possible, including sponsors, members of the media, security, etc.,"" he said. How the Moderators Were Picked Commission officials are tasked with picking the moderators for the debates, and while they normally announce their decisions in August, the final list was released in September this year. ""These journalists bring extensive experience to the job of moderating, and understand the importance of using expanded time periods effectively,? Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. and Michael D. McCurry, co-chairs of the nonpartisan commission, said in the statement announcing the moderators. Raddatz, who is a co-anchor of the ABC News Sunday show ""This Week,"" is the only one of the four who has been selected by the commission before. She moderated the vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan in 2012. CNN's Candy Crowley was selected to moderate the town hall-style debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney in 2012. This year, that format will have two moderators: Raddatz and Cooper. Crowley was the second female debate moderator ever. The first was ABC News' Carole Simpson in 1992. ""The formats chosen for this year's debates are designed to build on the formats introduced in 2012, which focused big blocks of time on major domestic and foreign topics,? Fahrenkopf and McCurry said in the statement. ?We are grateful for their willingness to moderate, and confident that the public will learn more about the candidates and the issues as a result.? Debate Prep Underway Trump spoke repeatedly about his relaxed approach to preparations ahead of the first presidential debate. That might have changed with the second debate, but not according to Trump: he denies that a town hall-style event in New Hampshire on Thursday -- complete with a timer set to the same response times required for Sunday's debate -- was practice for the main event this weekend. Kaine and Pence have both been running mock debates, with D.C. power lawyer Bob Barnett acting as Pence and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker standing in as Kaine. As for the top of their tickets, the candidates took dramatically different approaches to debate prep in keeping with their starkly different campaigns. Clinton cleared her schedule and took herself off the campaign trail for the four days before the first debate. She did intensive debate prep, which included mock debates complete with a Trump stand-in: her longtime aide Philippe Reines, whom Clinton has called ""loyal, passionate and shrewd."" She also reviewed Trump's performance in Republican primary debates, according to campaign sources. By contrast, Trump had two campaign events scheduled days before the first debate on Sept. 26. His debate prep was slim and he did not delve into policy or participated in mock debates, sources have told ABC News. The one study tactic that they both shared was a review of their opponent's past performances. But while aides say Clinton actively reviewed Trump's work, senior level Trump sources said he was given an iPad loaded with footage of old Clinton debates, though it's unclear how much time he spent watching them. Trump was reportedly being advised by his senior campaign staff, including campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and campaign CEO Stephen Bannon, as well as former Fox News chief Roger Ailes, who has worked on the campaigns of Presidents George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan in the past. Well-known Washington lawyer Bob Barnett was said to be advising Clinton during her debate prep. He helped her prepare for the primary debates by playing Sen. Bernie Sanders. The campaign reportedly found someone to play Trump in their mock debates but they were tight-lipped about the person's identity. Trumpdidn speak extensively about his debate prep, but talked about the tone he expected to take. ""I'm going to be very respectful of her,"" Trump said during a phone interview on Fox News before the first debate, referring to Clinton. ""I think she deserves that and I'm going to be nice. And if she's respectful of me,that be nice. We'll have something that I think people will respect as a debate but we'll see where it all goes. You really never know exactly how it's going to turn out and that's whywe going to have a lot of people watching,"" Trump said. ABC News' Liz Kreutz, John Santucci, Candace Smith and Ryan Struyk contributed to this report. Watch FULL LIVE COVERAGE of the third presidential debate at 9 p.m. ET on Wednesday, Oct. 19.

"Today marks the one-week mark ahead of the first of the three presidential debates during the 2016 campaign and the candidates are gearing up. Interested in Elections? Add Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest The Commission on Presidential Debates announced today the broad topics that are slated to be covered during the first debate: America's Direction, Achieving Prosperity and Securing America. The topics were selected by the moderator, Lester Holt of ""NBC Nightly News,"" but are ""subject to possible changes because of news developments."" The commission also made its final decision on Friday that there would only be two candidates taking the debate stage on Monday, Sept. 26. It ruled that neither Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson nor Green Party nominee Jill Stein had met the 15 percent mark in a combination of polls, which had previously been set as the bar for participation qualification. Before Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Clinton head to Hofstra University, the site of the first debate, the candidates and their campaign aides have started teasing their debate prep strategies. Trump started his debate prep in late August, and at the time, sources told ABC News that he hadn't participated in mock debates, which is one of the more typical prep strategies for presidential candidates. As for Trump's personal debate strategy, he hasn't talked about the specifics of his game plan, focusing more on how he will deal with facing one opponent head on. ""I will treat her with great respect unless she treats me in a certain manner, in which case that will be the end of that,"" Trump said about Clinton last week during an appearance on Sean Hannity's Fox News show. ""But I'm certainly starting off with the feeling that I'm going to treat her with great respect. I hope we can talk about policy and certain things.

"While HillaryClinton deplorablescomment was ?inartful,? the former Meet the Press host David Gregory said that it ?may have been accurate? based on surveys and anecdotal evidence. In an interview, CNN host Chris Cuomo and David Gregory were discussing how even though Trump is a racist ? based on his comments of Muslims and illegal immigrants, and his acceptingsupport from the KKK and David Duke ? and a sexist ? based on his comments in the past about women ? the polls are showing a shocking level of support for him. Cuomo asked Gregory, ?Does that tell you that people who know stilldon care??Here how he responded: ?Well, I thinkthere an element of that. I mean, Idon know that we can back that up by the data, but I do think just, look, anybody looks at a politician and says, ?Look, Idon agree with everything, but I still support them.? I thinkthere people who willfully ignore certain things that Trump says and focus on what they like about him. I thinkthat true. ?I think Hillary Clinton is in a posture ? and you saw it in that answer which I thought was revealing ? first of all, she wants to sidestep the fact that she did impugn a lot of Trump voters in a way that was inartful, but it may have been based ? it may have been accurate in certain ? based on some of the surveys thatwe seen about attitudes of Trump supporters and other anecdotal information that we have. But, you know, her whole slogan rhetorically iswe ?stronger together,? and that was not an example of that when she was in that fundraiser. ?Thereshe saying, ?No,I going to speak out against hateful speech, about the fact thathe a birther, that David Duke is behind him.? I mean, I think this is her getting a little bit more aggressive. I think this is a preview of the kind of Hillary Clinton thatwe see during aspects of these presidential debates.? Idon doubt that some ofTrump supporters choose not to focus on certain things that he says, but Idonthey ?willfully ignoring? those things. Besides, even if they were ?willfully ignoring? the controversial stuff that Trump has said, what about HillaryClinton supporters? Are they really any different? They willfully ignore all the scandalous and criminal behaviorthat inextricably tied to their presidential choice. I agree that Trump has come across as brash, especially in the earlier part of his campaign, but actions speak louder than words.

"John Kerry says Washington cannot be successful alone. | AP Photo Kerry says Syrian diplomacy at impasse after truce collapses NEW YORK ? The United States and Russia ended any pretenses Thursday of their cease-fire for Syria remaining in force after days of increased violence and the Syrian military's announcement of a new offensive in Aleppo. ""We can't go out to the world and say we have an agreement when we don't,"" Secretary of State John Kerry said after meeting the top diplomats from Russia and more than a dozen European and Middle Eastern countries. Story Continued Below Kerry's statement, after three days of private and public diplomacy on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, provided an ominous endnote to a week diplomats had hoped would be a major capstone toward peace. Instead, Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who negotiated the truce two weeks ago, went their separate ways as violence in Syria flared anew and the relationship between the two key foreign powers in the conflict appeared to reach a new low. No one spoke of being able to quickly resuscitate the cease-fire. While Kerry and Lavrov were set to hold more talks Friday, even confidence-building measures seem beyond their reach at this point. As the diplomats huddled in a New York hotel, Syria's military command said it would restart operations in the northern city of Aleppo, scene of some of the most bitter fighting in recent months. According to one official present in the gathering, Kerry was informed of the news when his chief of staff showed him a headline on his BlackBerry. A furious Kerry then told the entire room, Lavrov included, that ""even while we are meeting here, they are doing this,"" said the official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity. Lavrov told Russian media that consultations would continue to ""guarantee"" the cease-fire. But even as Kerry vowed to press on with all efforts to find a peaceful solution to the war between Syrian President Bashar Assad's Russian-backed government and U.S.-backed rebels, he acknowledged the current strategy wasn't working. ""We can't be the only ones trying to hold this door open,"" Kerry told reporters. ""Russia and the regime must do their part or this will have no chance."" He called for the immediate grounding of planes and helicopters that have launched airstrikes, including a Russian one earlier this week that the U.S. says hit an aid convoy, killing 20 civilians. Russia has denied responsibility, while raising a range of ulterior scenarios for how the caravan might have been struck. ""Absent a major gesture like this, we don't believe there is a point to making more promises or issuing more plans or announcing something that can't be reached,"" Kerry said, describing a ""moment of truth"" for Syria, Russia and all those trying to halt the bloodshed. The meeting came after Assad told the AP in an interview in Damascus that the United States was to blame for the deal's failure. He cited U.S. inability to control ""terrorist"" groups and a weekend attack that killed dozens of Syrian soldiers. The U.S. apologized for what it described as a mistake. Lavrov had sought a three-day pause in fighting to revive the cease-fire. But U.S. officials said there was no point returning to a situation in which rebels would be pressed to hold fire, while the Syrian and Russian military's could violate the agreement.",0.042079208,0.0,0.0,0.017326733,0.079207921,0.287128713,0.0024752479999999998,2,-1,1
"Story highlights The military battle for Mosul could soon begin once the Iraqis make the political decision to proceed The battle for Mosul may be raging during the US presidential election (CNN) US forces will be ready within weeks to help Iraqi forces in their battle to retake Mosul from ISIS, according to Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""Our job is to actually help the Iraqis generate the forces and the support necessary for operations in Mosul and we'll be ready for that in October,"" Dunford told a small group of reporters traveling with him. ""The noose is gradually tightening around Mosul,"" he added. The city, Iraq's second-largest, is ISIS' last significant stronghold in the country. It and Syria's Raqqa -- the group's self-declared capital -- are the major targets left for the US-led coalition to take back from its control. Dunford's statement is the clearest sign from a senior US military official that the military battle for Mosul could soon begin once the Iraqis make the political decision to proceed. It also means the battle for Mosul may be raging during the US presidential election, with US forces facing dangers on the battlefield.

"We stillcan believe this devastating news!!! As of Sunday evening, we have lost one of the most legendary men in our nation. Arnold Palmer has passed away at the age of 87 years old. Many people were shocked upon hearing this news. The golfing community is obviously devastated by the loss of such a legendary man. Upon hearing the news, the U.S. Golf Association released a saddening yet inspirational statement. ?We are deeply saddened by the death of Arnold Palmer,golf greatest ambassador, at age 87,. Arnold Palmer will always be a champion, in every sense of the word. He inspired generations to love golf by sharing his competitive spirit, displaying sportsmanship, caring for golfers and golf fans, and serving as a lifelong ambassador for the sport. Our stories of him not only fill the pages ofgolf history books and the walls of the museum, but also our own personal golf memories. The game is indeed better because of him, and in so many ways, will never be the same.? He was known as ?the King of Golf?, but was known for much more than that. Palmer received many awards in the sport as well as outside the sport. Awards with high honors such as the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal, and more. Every time Palmer accepted these awards, he offered some golf tips to whoever presented him with theawards was most of the time the President of the United States! Anyone who came into contact with him, golfer or not, immediately encountered a good time. He knew how to relate to everyone, no matter the age, occupation or position they were in life. Palmer started out as an avid pilot who loved to play the game of golf. He attended Wake Forest College on a golf scholarship, which only grew his love for the sport even more. Palmer won his first tour during his rookie season in 1955, and the rest is history. Palmer brought a new attitude to golf. Unlike the other players, he took risks and tried things that ultimately may have made him look crazy from time to time. Hewasn your average straight laced golfer, andthat what made him rise to stardom as well as success in the golf world. Palmer had a major influence on practically every golfer in the world. Upon hearing the devastating news, American golfer, Tiger Woods, expressed how impactful Palmer has been over the years. ?Arnold meant everything to golf. Are you kidding me?. I mean, without his charisma, without his personality in conjunction with TV ? it was just the perfect symbiotic growth. You finally had someone who had this charisma, andthey capturing it on TV for the very first time. Everyone got hooked to the game of golf via TV because of Arnold.? Arnold will be missed by many people from many walks of life, as numerous people of high status and beyond have already started to mourn.

"""If implemented, these proposals would provoke retaliation by U.S. trading partners,"" the study said. | Getty Study:Trump trade proposals ?horribly destructive? DonaldTrump threat to raise tariffs on China, Mexico and other countries to force them to negotiate better deals with the United States ?could unleash a trade war that would plunge the U.S. economy into recession and cost more than 4 million private sector jobs,? says a new study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The nonpartisan think tank, which leans pro-free trade, outlines several scenarios that could result from the Republican nominee's plans to raise tariffs and withdraw from trade deals, including the sweeping Asia-Pacific pact that the Obama administration wrapped up last year. Its conclusion:Trump assault on NAFTA, China, the Trans-Pacific Partnership and other trade deals would harm average American households, worsen income stagnation, devastate businesses and erode national security ? and he would have the statutory authority to do it. Story Continued Below ""If implemented, these proposals would provoke retaliation by U.S. trading partners, unleashing a trade war that would send the U.S. economy into recession and cost millions of Americans their jobs,"" the study says.Trump top trade advisers dismissed the study as biased Monday, saying it comes from a corporate-funded think tank and ?signifies nothing.? ?They are the pimps of globalization for the corporate interests who have sent American jobs overseas and basically turned America into a stagnant economy,? said Peter Navarro, an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine who has helped Trump develop his trade policies. Nearly half of theInstitute revenue comes from major export-oriented corporations like Caterpillar, Pepsi and United Technologies, according to its website. The study comes as Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton rail against past trade policies for inflicting job losses and economic pain among working-class voters. President Barack Obama, who is pressing Congress to ratify the massive Trans-Pacific Partnership before he leaves office, has pushed back against both candidates? trade stances. While the Peterson Institute also faultsClinton proposals, which call mainly for tougher enforcement, as leading to stasisin the expansion of trade, it reserves the bulk of its criticism for Trump. His policies ?are another matter altogether? and could have disastrous consequences for the economy and for national security, the study says. Its projections are built on an earlierMoody Analytics study that estimated the economic effects ofTrump call for steep tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports and the renegotiation of trade deals like NAFTA. Under the worst-case scenario, U.S. employment could drop by nearly 5 million jobs in 2019, with states like Washington, California, Massachusetts and Michigan suffering losses of nearly 5 percent of private-sector jobs, the think tank says. ?Even if the statements are strategic, acting on them can, intentionally or not, produce escalating cycles of retaliation by trading partners,? the Peterson Institute says. ?When planning a war, it is not advisable to assume thatone adversary will surrender when the first shot is fired. For these reasons, Trump must be taken at his word.? But Navarro,Trump trade adviser, says hisTrump threat of tariffs is not an endgame but ?simply part of an overall negotiating tool which is designed to get better and fairer deals.? Another Trump adviser, Nucor steel company CEO Dan DiMicco, quipped that the study is designed to scare voters and ?should have come out on Halloween.? But DiMicco saidTrump threats are ""very real, and our trading partners who are cheating should take it very seriously."" Unchecked government subsidies and currency manipulation are just some of the ways other countries are gaining an unfair trade advantage, he said. Trump could execute his stated plans to stop countries like China from cheatingthrough executive powers that allow the president to raise tariffs unilaterally, the study finds. The nominee even went so far as to lay out the statutes he would invoke to retaliate againstChina ?illegal activities? in a June 28 speech. Many of the authorities allow the president to hike tariffs or restrict imports in other ways based on broad interpretations of national security. U.S. companiescouldn count on lawmakers or the courts to act fast enough to head off any initial economic shocks caused byTrump policies, the Peterson study says. ?At least for a few years, a President Trump would have the stronger legal hand and his actions would very likely survive challenges in the U.S. courts and Congress,? it says. Legal action challenging the statutory authority could take months or even years, and any efforts by major U.S. importers like Apple to seek rapid relief through preliminary injunctions to stop Customs and Border Protection from collecting those duties would face legal uncertainty, the authors write. Even if Trump threatened high tariffs only as a tactical maneuver, ?foreign countries will soon retaliate,? they say. Countries ""will not patiently wait for U.S court proceedings or litigation in the WTO to vindicate their claimed rights under international law ? specifically the right to export to the U.S. market at low [bound] tariffs, or duty free,? the authors say. ?Enormous economic damage to U.S. firms, workers and communities could ensue from a trade war long before the legal battlefield is cleared.""",0.034124629,0.0,0.004451039,0.026706231,0.038575668,0.31602373899999997,0.0,2,-1,1
"Share Tweet Email address: Leave this field empty if you're human: According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that theydon end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities. Case in point. The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and achild genitals, so ifyou a parent of a child andyou changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath,you a felon. For real. This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from ?intentionally or knowingly touching? the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because theydon know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids. The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that ?prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.? They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right? In others words, just trust the prosecutors,y.There no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them. Wow. There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. Buthere an especially interesting tidbit: As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, themajority logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state SupremeCourt help,Arizona child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent orcaregiver of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of thestate residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended forArizona parents and caregivers. Yikes. ButI sureit all just work itself out.

They cut out the lower two tears of the penalty system and are only focusing on issuing penalties for failing post race laser inspection if the car fails it to a large degree.

"A new crime show has revealed a shocking twist in the case of JonBenet Ramsey's murder. On Sept. 19, ""The Case Of: JonBenet Ramsey"" aired on CBS, revealing a surprising suspect in the murder -- her brother, Burke Ramsey. In 1996, JonBenet, a child beauty queen, was found beaten and strangled to death in her family's cellar, just hours after her mother, Patsy, called 911 to report that she had been kidnapped. To this day, no charges have been filed in the case and there has been much speculation about who may be responsible. In the new two-part CBS documentary, a team of experts reviews the evidence in the case and, in the final minutes of the special, reveal that they have reason to believe Burke, who was 9 at the time, may be the suspect. The experts believe, however, that JonBenet's death could have been accidental. It was revealed in the documentary that Burke struck his younger sister with a golf club a year before her death after ""losing his temper,"" according to the Daily Mail. James Kolar, former chief of investigation for the District Attorney in Boulder, presented the theory that Burke may be responsible for JonBenet's death. He noted that Patsy had left a bowl of pineapple and some tea for Burke and that when Burke caught JonBenet trying to sneak some of the fruit later on, he lashed out and struck her with a flashlight, killing her. ""My hypothesis was that I think the Ramseys came home around 9:30, 10 o'clock,"" Kolar said. ""I think JonBenet was asleep. I think John did carry her upstairs, Patsy remained downstairs with Burke and served him the tea and the pineapple. I think that accounts for the physical evidence as well as the latent print. Then she got JonBenet up to make sure she used the toilet, so she didn't wet the bed that night."" Kolar added, ""JonBenet was up, she may or may not have brushed her teeth, that stuff was out on the counter, then I think she was up and awake enough that she was maybe still hungry and she went downstairs."" ""In the meantime, Patsy continued packing for the Michigan trip,"" he continued. ""I think if Burke was upset about circumstances or Christmas presents, he probably would have been upset about her trying to snag a piece of pineapple -- out of anger he may have struck her with that flashlight."" Investigators believe that there was likely no intent to kill on Burke's part, but that the Ramsey family had intended to mislead the investigation. ""The Ramsey family did not want law enforcement to resolve this case and that's why it remains unresolved,"" former FBI profiler Jim Clemente said. Investigators added that they do not believe Burke was involved in the cover-up, but that both parents likely were, based on the conflicting motives in the ransom letter. It was also concluded that DNA on JonBenet's underwear did not match any family member and did not prove that any sexual assault had taken place, notes Us Weekly.",0.034383954,0.017191977,0.00286533,0.031518625,0.065902579,0.269340974,0.0,2,-1,1
"When Hillary Clinton resigned as U.S. secretary of state in 2013, Beijingwasn sorry to see her go. In her four years in office, the former first lady and senator had gained a reputation in China as a source of hostility in an administration that had otherwise tried to be accommodating. In particular, Clinton rankled Beijing by rallyingChina neighbors against its maneuvers in the South China Sea. Shortly after she was succeeded by John Kerry,China state-controlled Global Times wrote that ?for the Chinese people, the hard line of former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been unforgettable.? To fans ofClinton tough-minded approach to foreign policy, the description was a badge of honor ? and an example of how her approach to the world will differ from U.S. President BarackObama if she is elected in November. ?If you ask the Chinese or the Japanese or the Australians,they tell you Clinton is the realist, the balance-of-power person,? said Michael Green, who served as senior director for Asia on George W.Bush National Security Council. Green, now senior vice president for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, briefed Clinton and her team twice on Asian affairs and came away impressed. He is also one of 50 Republican foreign policy experts who signed a letter this summer denouncing theparty nominee, Donald Trump. Clinton has long described her Iraq vote as a mistake, but she has since taken a series of other stands that have bolstered a reputation for hawkishness. A Clinton White House would undoubtedly provide U.S. foreign policy with a dose of continuity ? especially when compared to the wild-card uncertainty of a Trump presidency. But the former top diplomat would also bring an alternative approach to statecraft. And she would also face a different set of domestic and geopolitical limitations, particularly when it comes to trade and the relationship between the U.S. and Europe. Where Obama is cerebral and deliberative, the narrative goes, Clinton does her homework but is quicker to make decisions. Where Obama points out the United States? historic failings and missteps, Clinton, a child of the Cold War and an advocate of NATO expansion, is firmly in the ?American exceptionalism? camp. ?I believe we are stillLincoln ?last, best hope of Earth,?? she said in an August 31 speech in Ohio. ?We?re stillReagan ?shining city on a hill.?We still RobertKennedy ?great, unselfish, compassionate country.?? At a time when most Americans seem averse to putting boots on the ground just about anywhere,Clinton team has described her approach as ?more muscular? thanObama ? with its reliance on drones and special forces operations ? and perhaps better suited to the current international environment. And, of course,there the 2002 vote in Congress authorizing military action in Iraq. Her yesvote probably cost her theparty nomination in 2008. Clinton has long described her Iraq vote as a mistake, but she has since taken a series of other stands that have bolstered a reputation for hawkishness. She argued against a drastic drawdown of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and supported an intervention in Libya, decisions that put her at odds with many in her party. Clinton has pledged to keep U.S. ground troops out of Syria. Chinese officials are thought to be wary of a Clinton presidency. Her adversarial approach to Beijing dates back to 1995, when, as first lady, she famously said that ?women?s rights are human rights? at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing. And during her tenure as secretary of state, her team pushed back during bilateral negotiations when Beijing sought to expand the number of issues it deemed to be Chinese ?core interests,? along the lines of Tibet and Taiwan. It is important to note, however, that many ofClinton top officials are likely to be holdovers from the current or previous administrations, making sharp breaks in policy unlikely. Her top foreign policy aide and likely national security advisor is Jake Sullivan, who played a key role in the U.S. opening up to Myanmar and advised on the Iran nuclear deal implemented after Clinton left office. Former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul has served as a high-profile surrogate when it comes to Russia, and observers expect him to play a role in a Clinton administration. On Asia, former Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt Campbell, an architect of the Obamaadministration so-called Asia pivot, is likely to play a large role in a Clinton presidency. Many expect to see former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Michelle Flournoy, who worked on Russia and Ukraine, in a top job. Economic shifts The biggest difference between Obama and Clinton is likely to be less about military deployments or diplomatic showdowns than about economic policy. Historically, Clinton has been a proponent of free trade. But in the last year, the anti-trade sentiment that helped boost the candidacies of Trump, andClinton primary opponent, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, has pushed her to the left on the issue. That could leave her far more constrained than her predecessors, including her husband and Obama, when it comes to trade deals.She already disavowed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the free-trade agreement for which she helped lay the groundwork during her time in Foggy Bottom. And her statements on the campaign trail call into question whether she would rush to strike a deal on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which she described as an ?economic NATO? in 2012. As with all presidents, however,Clinton foreign policy would less likely be governed by grand strategy than by the geopolitical landscape and unfolding events. And the world, to put it lightly, looks different than it did when Clinton last held office. ?It?s not the Europe of the Clinton era of the 1990s andit not even the Europe of the beginning of the Obama administration? ? Fiona Hill, director at the Brookings Institution The war in Syria and the rise of the Islamic State have dramatically destabilized the Middle East.China president, Xi Jinping, is re-asserting thecountry dominance in East Asia. North Korea is widely believed to be on the verge of developing a nuclear weapon that could threaten the continental United States. Russian President Vladimir Putin has annexed Crimea and is intent on being a player, or at least a spoiler, in Syria ? and perhaps in the U.S. elections themselves. But nowhere has the landscape been more drastically altered than Europe.Obama detached nature, combined with controversies over the U.S. spying on its allies, left many Europeans disappointed. But since then, much has changed, as a spate of terrorist attacks, a worrying refugee crisis and the decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union upended the status quo. ?It?s not the Europe of the Clinton era of the 1990s andit not even the Europe of the beginning of the Obama administration,? said Fiona Hill, the director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution and a former national intelligence officer on the National Intelligence Council. The question, experts say, is whether Clinton would see the EU as an ally, or as a problem to be managed. Patrick Cronin, a senior advisor at the Center for a New American Security and a top official at the U.S. Agency for International Development under George W. Bush, expects a greater emphasis by her on personal relationships with EU leaders than Obama. ?She?ll be stronger on the transatlantic relationship than Obama was initially,? said Cronin.

"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation ? where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners ? the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed goodthat the foundation has done over the years. Idon think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence thatthey an organization for good. The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity: Just 5.7 percent of the ClintonFoundation massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exemptorganization IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and ?other expenses.? The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, theorganization IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as ?other expenses,? while the remaining almost $851K was marked as ?professional fundraising expenses.? Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more ?other expenses? in 2014. Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

"Donald Trump ended one of the sharpest exchanges in last night's debate against Hillary Clinton with a pointed question: ""Why did she delete 33,000 emails?"" Interested in Hillary Clinton? Add Hillary Clinton as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hillary Clinton news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Clinton is doing her best to move beyond the controversy over her use of a private email server as secretary of state, saying only last night that she ""made a mistake"" and declining to address why those emails were deleted. She didn't answer Trump's questions. However, there is an answer. The bottom line: Clinton believed the deleted emails were not work-related. In late 2014, the State Department asked Clinton and other former secretaries of state to hand over any work-related emails they may have. By then, Clinton had already ""deleted some [emails] over time as an ordinary user would,"" FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers at a July congressional hearing. And she tasked her legal team to determine which of the roughly 60,000 emails still on her server were work-related. ""Clinton told the FBI that she directed her legal team to provide any work-related or arguably work-related emails to State; however she did not participate in the development of the specific process to be used or in discussions of the locations of where her emails might exist,"" the FBI concluded in its investigative summary of the case. Comey testified that the FBI ""didn't find any evidence of evil intent and intent to obstruct justice."" To determine which emails were work-related, a member ofClinton legal team did four things: she automatically deemed any email sent from or to a .gov and .mil address as related to work; she searched the tens of thousands of emails for names of senior State Department officials, lawmakers, foreign leaders and other government officials; she conducted a keyword search for work-related terms; and she looked at the sender, recipient and ""subject"" of every email for other potentially work-related emails, but she did not read the contents of those emails. In December 2014,Clinton legal team provided about 30,000 emails -- totaling 55,000 pages -- to the State Department. ""[Clinton] then was asked by her lawyers at the end, 'Do you want us to keep the personal emails?' And she said, 'I have no use for them anymore.' It's then that they issued the direction that the technical people delete them,"" Comey told lawmakers. In total, more than 30,000 emails were deleted ""because they were personal and private about matters that I believed were within the scope of my personal privacy,"" Clinton told reporters in March of 2015, as the controversy around her private emails was growing. ""They had nothing to do with work,"" Clinton added. ""I didn't see any reason to keep them ... no one wants their personal emails made public, and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy."" Clinton said her team ""went through a thorough process"" to identify work-related emails, and she said he had ""absolute confidence that everything that could be in any way connected to work is now in the possession of the State Department."" However, after a year-long investigation, the FBI recovered more than 17,000 emails that had been deleted or otherwise not turned over to the State Department, and many of them were work-related, the FBI has said. Republican critics have accused Clinton of using a private server and ultimately deleting emails to skirt federal records laws aimed at promoting transparency, and earlier this month the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said, ""The sequence of events leading up to the destruction of SecretaryClinton emails ... raises questions about whether Secretary Clinton, acting through her attorneys, instructed [aides and others] to destroy records relevant to"" a Congressional investigation of the deadly Benghazi attack. At the July hearing before Chaffetz's committee, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, asked Comey, ""Did Secretary Clinton know her legal team deleted those emails that they kept from [Congress]?"" ""I don't believe so,"" Comey responded. During Monday night's debate, Trump promised to release his tax returns ""when she releases her 33,000 emails that have been deleted,"" adding that he would ""go against"" the advice of his lawyers ""if she releases her emails."" Moderator Lester Holt then asked Trump if that meant releasing his tax returns was negotiable. Trump responded: ""It's not negotiable. No, let her release her emails. Why did she delete 33,000 emails?""",0.032374101,0.003597122,0.005395683,0.010791367,0.073741007,0.214028777,0.0,2,-1,1

"The pro-gun crowd loves guns first, and respect last. At least, that seems to be the case with whoever made a truly horrible meme out of an old black-and-white war photo. The photo depicts troops executing a couple of people in the back as they kneel in front of a mass grave. The troops ?are just obeying orders,? and the dead in the mass grave are ?citizens obeying gun laws.? This is the meme: Wedon know who created this, but wedon have enough middle fingers to express how we feel about them. The piece of shit behind this is no doubt someone who believes the lie that, had the Jewish citizens of Germany and elsewhere just had guns, the Holocaustwouldn have happened. The photo in the meme is from the German-occupied Soviet Union, and depicts one of the mobile execution squads known as theEinsatzgr. They were tasked with mass executions of Jews, communists, and anyone else that the Nazis decidedweren suitable to living their empire and master race. Tens of thousands were murdered this way ? they are part of the Holocaust. The myth of guns and the Holocaust is so completely and terribly wrong it defies description. Yes, the Nazis seized guns from their enemies, however, they actuallydidn make much of a dent in total gun circulation in Germany, contrary to what the gun-rights crowd wants us to believe. Furthermore, the Nazis actually loosened gun laws in 1938 for everyone except Jews. People who have a basic understanding of Nazi Germany know that the Nazis targeted more groups than Jews, and they know that more people than Jews opposed the Nazis however quietly they had to. Whydidn those people, who could own guns, rise up?It because of the power of a police state ? the very thing the ?moar gunz? crowd fears the most. Therefore, the cretin who came up with this meme can rightfully be termed as having no clue what they are talking about. But worse than that, they have no problem whatsoever with using the horror of the Holocaust to further their ?all guns all the time? agenda. That is just abominable, and has no place in any discourse at all.Here why: ?This historical second-guessing is deeply offensive to Jews, Holocaust survivors and those who valiantly fought against Hitler during World War II. It is, in fact, as many historians have previously noted, a distortion of history itself? ?When you manipulate the history of the Holocaust and use it to score political points, its wholly inappropriate and offensive. Especially for the sake of the victims of the Nazi onslaught and their memory, it must stop.?That from Jonathan Greenblatt, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League. He was speaking against BenCarson painfully offensive assertion that the Nazis had disarmed everyone so they could kill Jews with impunity, butit just not true. Andit an serious affront to every single victim of the Nazis, as well as everyone who fought them. Thismeme creator ought to go back to the depths of the hellish abyss that first spat him out.

"So I guess it is back to school for everyone. I am not really too sure, as the last time I was in a classroom they actually taught curriculum that benefitted students. I saw an interesting article in Breitbart today which read: ?Northwestern President: Critics of Safe Spaces, Trigger Warnings are ?Lunatics'?. The article, which appeared in NorthwesternUniversity student rag newspaper, The Daily Northwestern, was based on a speech given by NU President Morton Schapiro. I know that listening to libtards is enough to make any of my readers lose their lunch, so I will simply hit the high points. In his speech Schapiro said: ?The people who decry safe spaces do it from their segregated housing places, from their jobs without diversity ? they do it from their country clubs. It just drives me nuts.? And about microaggression, what did this academic sainte have to say? ?Microaggressions cut you to the core andaren easily forgotten?? Ok, first things first: According to his bio, Morton Schapiro has never worked a day in his life outside of academics. While his resume might sound impressive it has all been in schools and colleges. This is important because it means that he has nothing in common with the students that will eventually have to graduate his college and, gasp in horror, find a job. Dr. Schapiro told students that ??Look for those safe spaces. If youcan find them, we will help you find them.? Alright, call me a sadist, but I would love to be a fly on the wall when one ofNU students goes into a job interview and starts talking about safe spaces. Hey buttercup, the real worlddoesn have those! What are you going to do, little snowflake, when you meet a co-worker or even a boss who says things that you consider ?microaggressive?? Are you going to run to your safe space and hide in your blanket fort whilst sipping a juice box? Are you going to sit there in a boardroom during a meeting and cry because someone said something that goes against what you believe? If you can answer yes to both of those questions then you will not be employed for too long. To survive in the real world you need a level of self discipline and a really, really tough skin. The working world is tough,it a lot tougher when you are a wuss. The whole purpose of college is to prepare its students for the real world not only by teaching them academics that can get them jobs, but also by preparing them for a tough, cold world. Well, at least that use to be its purpose. Now the purpose of college is to brainwash and coddle, making spineless wimps out out of the strong and airheads out of the smart.Today colleges are run by administrators and teachers who have never worked a day in the private sector. They teach theory, not reality. Students come out with student debts in the hundreds of thousands without the skills necessary to survive in the working world.

"The cornerstone of DonaldTrump presidential campaign can be summed up in just a few words: Things suck andit allObama fault. For Trump, this tweet pretty much optimizes his take on poverty: Our country does not feel ?great already? to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair. ? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2016 This was in response to President Obama saying during the Democratic National Convention that ?America is already great.? So, who is correct? Are Americans trapped in a socioeconomic hell hole or are things far more optimistic? According to a study published by the New York Times, things are vastly better for Americans than they were when Obama took office in 2009. The article began by profiling Alex Caicedo of Gaithersburg, MD. A few years ago, Caicedo was struggling with odd and part time jobs. He and his family were forced to live with his mother-in-law. Today, he has a steady middle class job with benefits and the family is ready to move out of his mother-in-law?s home. They are far from alone. The Caicedos are among the 3.5 million Americans who were able to raise their chins above the poverty line last year, according to census data released this month. More than seven years after the recession ended, employers are finally being compelled to reach deeper into the pools of untapped labor, creating more jobs, especially among retailers, restaurants and hotels, and paying higher wages to attract workers and meet new minimum wage requirements. What about the minorities, who, according to Trump, have never had it worse? Well,that another Trump lie. Not only have minorities suffered much, much worse throughout history (slavery, Jim Crow), but they too have it dramatically better since Obama took office. Poverty declined among every group. But African-Americans and Hispanics ? who account for more than 45 percent of those below the poverty line of $24,300 for a family of four in most states ? experienced the largest improvement. Sorry, Republicans, but youdon get an ounce of credit for the improvements. If anything, things would be much better if Republicansweren in office. The Times credits social programs like Social Security and food stamps for keeping people out of poverty. They also credit the fall in oil prices for people being able to commute to their jobs. One major factor, and Republicans will hate this, is that the increases in minimum wage are also taking people out of poverty. After a long period of rising inequality, Elise Gould, an economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute in Washington, added, the benefits of the improving economy finally began to seep downward. Wage increases were ?even stronger at the bottom than in the middle,? she said. Still,it not enough. 43 million Americans still live in poverty. Republicans have successfully blocked poor people from acquiring college degrees or job training that might help raise people out of poverty. For those without access to computers or the internet, finding a job can be burdensome. For those whocan afford cars, a job search can be impossible. If this proves anything, it should be thatit time to continue successful Democratic policies, not cut them off at the knees, as Republicans would do.

"TERROR IN THE USA: Bombs Found In NY & NJ Made By Same Person [VIDEO] As far as terrorism is concerned, yesterday was a good and a bad day for Americans. In addition to a knife wielding Allah chanting attacker in a Minnesota mall, who injured 7 before being shot dead by an off duty police officer, there was an undetonated bomb found in Seaside Park in NJ and 2 bombs found in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, one undetonated and one detonated, which injured 29 people. At this juncture, police are saying that all three devices appear to have been made by the same person. It was a good day in that no intended victims died. And it was a bad day in that these incidents expose how vulnerable Americans are to these kinds of attacks, especially in urban areas with large numbers of people in them. Terrorists in America look like regular people. They are not wearing all black outfits and masks, or marching in groups down the middle of the street. They look like shoppers, coworkers and fellow subway riders. It is difficult to identify terrorists and that makes it difficult to discover their plans and stop therm. What we need to remember is this; these are not random attacks. They are, most times, planned out and carried out by radical Islamic terrorists who absolutely hate western civilization. When or if we see something odd or suspicious, we must say something. If a guy is standing in line at Walmart buying 4 pressure cookers,that something odd. We cannot assume that everyone around has our best interests in mind. If you see something, say something. ? 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now We need a President who will get serious about vetting immigrants, stemming the tide of refugees and illegal immigrants and keeping Americans safe. We know which person will do that if elected and itisn Hillary. If Hillary wins, she will bring more refugees in. She has said it. If Trump wins, he will put an end to our destructive immigration policy. And that is what he has said. The safety of Americans on our own soil must be paramount. It is time to get serious about which people we let in and which ones wedon. There are 7 knife victims and 29 bombing victims who deserved better. They deserve a government that puts them first. While the knife attacker in the mall was thankfully taken out by an armed officer, New York City Police Commissioner James P.O said ?I am concerned, we have a bomb that detonated and no one apprehended.?That right, the bomber is still out there.

"In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a ?powerful hate group,? has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available. As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is thisauthor contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get ?Hillary the Horrible? into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election. A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone ? especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President ? to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud. The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters ? but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens ? to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America. Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible. Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party,America most powerful ?Hate Group,? not only wants ?Hillary the Horrible? to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed. Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

Donald Trump DonaldTrump tax cut would actually be even larger than RonaldReagan 1981 tax cut.

"I want this administrator to contact me.It not that hard ? that is, unlessyou truly the coward I sense that you are! As Written By Allen B. West: We know about the issues of free speech on our colleges and universities. It appears there are those who define free speech as the speech they deem acceptable. If you attempt to speak on issues to which the liberal progressive socialist left does not consent, you should be censored. Or at a minimum, the little cupcakes ask for a ?safe space? where theydon have to hear opposing views ? and here we were under the impression that institutions of higher learning were supposed to be places to encourage the free exchange of ideas. Many timeswe seen on the news and elsewhere stories of conservative speakers being denied the right to speak on college campuses.I watched this and just shaken my head. And then I would ask myself, when will it happen to me? Well, it has andI not happy about it at all. Earlier today, I did a radio interview with former Boston Red Sox baseball superstar pitcher Curt Schilling, and he informed me of somethingthat happening at St. Louis University of which Iwasn aware.I to speak on the campus of St. Louis University next week, September 29th, for the YoungAmerica Foundation (YAF), a student conservative organization. It appearsthere some administrator at St. Louis University who is attempting to limit the free speech of the YAF chapter on campus. I contacted my speakers bureau, Worldwide Speakers Group, who confirmed through YAF Headquarters in Virginia that a very disconcerting and disrespectful action was being taken. As posted at the YAF website, This week an administrator at Saint Louis University (SLU) informed students organizing a YAF-sponosred lecture by Lt. Col. Allen West they were not allowed to use the words ?radical Islam? on any advertisements for the event. The administrator also claimed West, who is a veteran of both Operation Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom, does not ?have experience with radical Islam.? These comments were made after students submitted event flyers for approval and campus officials rejected their design due to the inclusion of the words ?radical Islam.? SLU students confirmed these details to YoungAmerica Foundation this week. The lecture, scheduled for September 29, is part of YoungAmericaFoundation Fred Allen Lecture Series that is bringing Lt. Col. West to campuses across the country this school year. YAF activists will not back down in the face of challenges from politically correct campus bureaucrats. Let me make myself very clear here, whomever this misguided soul is, he or she has picked the wrong fight. This reminds me of the statement by John Kerry that if the media justdidn talk about Islamic terrorism, it would not be an issue. This administratorat St. Louis University represents the most deplorable embodiment of fascism. Here we are less than a week from a weekend of Islamic terrorist attacks and this individual does not want students to have an in-depth discussion about the most serious, savage, and barbaric threat this Nation has faced ? well, at least since the Barbary Pirates. And who is this person who believes they have any right to prescribe to a campus student group what can be advertised for their lecture series? Is this what our country is coming to, and is this what parents who send their kids to St. Louis University are willing to accept?I honored YAF has chosen me to be the main speaker of their Fred Allen Lecture Series, and I take this responsibility seriously to educate and inform our young people of the current geopolitical situation ? after all, they are our future leaders. Now, who is this administratorwho claims Idon ?have the experience with radical Islam? ? Whiskey-Tango-Foxtrot! Having served 22 years active service in the United States Army, to include combat tours of duty in the First Persian Gulf conflagration and commanding a Battalion in Operation Iraqi Freedom. And after retiring, I spent two and a half years in Afghanistan as a civilian/military advisor to the Afghan Army, based in Kandahar ? the place that was the capitol of the Taliban. Perhaps having served two years in Congress and sitting on the House Armed Services Committee is just not enough experience to be considered capable of addressing radical Islam. Or maybe, this administratorshould read the article I was asked to write by Military Review, the official professional journal of the US Army, for their January-February edition that addressed solutions to defeat ISIS ? a radical Islamic organization. I wonder if this administratorhas read, as I have several times, the MuslimBrotherhood Strategic Explanatory Memorandum for their engagement in North America ? the United States. Many nations, except the United States, have declared the Muslim Brotherhood an Islamic terrorist group. Bottom line, I want to know who this administratoris, and I demand he or she contact me directly. Sir orMa,I calling you out, and you tell me what about my service and experiences, in and out of uniform, disqualify me from addressing the issue of radical Islam, or Islamo-fascism, Islamic jihadism, or Islamic terrorism? The better question is, what do you think makes you experienced or qualified to make any judgement on me? Doggone right, I along with the YAF activists will not back down from this challenge. And if this is just a case of ill-conceived political correctness,we rectify that. But, if this is a case of the influence of stealth jihad radical Islamic campus organizations such as the Muslim Student Association, an affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood, then you will be exposed. And I recommend to the President of St. Louis University, you do not want it known that a radical Islamic organization is dictating speakers on your campus ? that is not the type of PR you really want.I coming to St. Louis University next week, Thursday, September 29th.I be discussing radical Islam and its affects upon freedom in the United States and across the globe.I use my intellect, experiences, and historical reading to share with students so they can be better educated and informed.

"AP Photo/Gerald Herbert ?Trump did not get a pass,? defiant Bondi says of fraud case Accused of a ?pay to play? scheme with Donald Trump, a defiant Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi broke her silence with thestate news media Tuesday to say that she had no regrets in accepting a $25,000 political contribution from the Republican at the same time her office said it was examining fraud allegations against Trump University that it ultimatelydidn pursue. ?Donald Trump did not get a pass,? Bondi told reporters. Story Continued Below Bondi told reporters that the contribution, made to her political committee amid her 2014 reelection campaign, had no bearing on heroffice decision to not join a civil fraud lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman against Trump University, which was defunct by the time she first took office in 2011. ?There never was an investigation into Donald Trump by this office,? Bondi said.Bondi first political opponent in 2010, former state senator and federal prosecutor Dan Gelber, recently said she should at least have returned the check to Trump while the New York case was pending. But Bondi on Tuesday said shedidn return the check because it would have looked as if it were a bribe. ?If I had returned it you would have reported ?Bondi accepted a bribe, got caught and returned it.? That's how the reporting goes,? Bondi said. ?And so, no, there was nothing improper about it. So there was no reason to return it.? Nonetheless, when controversy recently flared over the donation again,Bondi committee tried to return the check but Trumpwouldn accept it. Scores of complaints against Trump University and he related Trump Institute were filed during the term of her predecessor, Bill McCollum, who did not investigate. At the time she collected the contribution, only one additional complaint against Trump University had been filed with her office and, Bondi said, she was unaware of the complaint when she solicited the contribution from Trump. The attorneygeneral office fields tens of thousands of complaints yearly. Still, the timing ofBondi solicitation and acceptance of the check from Trump in 2013 have made the two Republicans an easy target for Democrats who have filed ethics complaints, accused her of participating in a ?pay to play? scheme and called for independent investigations. Trump once said that he gives money to politicians ""because when I want something, I get it. When I call, they kiss my ass.? But Trump said he never discussed Trump University with Bondi and backed her becauseshe a friend. As for why her officedidn take the case, Bondi said her office referred Florida-based complainants ? many of whom were elderly people who claimed they were scammed out of tens of thousands of dollars ? to New York because Trump University was based in that state. Bondi has bristled at the negative press coverage and said thatit wrong to question her pro-consumer record. ?We have returned billions of dollars to consumers since I have been in office,? she said. Bondi has been dogged by the timing of the Trump donation and heroffice inaction since her 2014 reelection campaign ? only to see the issue roar back to life when she endorsed Trump in Florida the day before the March 15 Republican presidential primary that he handily won. The issue died down until last month, when Trump began calling out Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by accusing her of using the Clinton Foundation as a pay-to-play scheme. Democrats hit back by pointing fingers at Bondi. ""My charity helps people, his is used to pay off your attorney general,"" Bill Clinton said at a Florida event earlier this month.Trump charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, was ensnared in the Trump University controversy because it was used to donate the $25,000 check toBondi committee. That broke IRS rules and Trump recently admitted to the Washington Post that he paid a fine over the error. The timing of the contribution was controversial from the start. On Aug. 24, Schneiderman announced his lawsuit against Trump University. Five days later, an Orlando Sentinel reporter calledBondi office to inquire about whether she would join the suit. ?We are currently reviewing the allegations in the New York complaint,? a Bondi spokeswoman told the reporter. About this time ? Bondi is unclear as to the details ? she solicited the check from Trump. Though her upper-level staff discussed the Schneiderman complaint, she said she was unaware of it. On Sept. 14, the Orlando Sentinel reported the Trump University lawsuit and, the following day, Bondi began receiving regular updates about the New York-based case. On Sept. 17, Bondi's political committee And Justice for All deposited the Trump check. The contribution was spotted by Orlando Sentinel columnist Scott Maxwell on Oct. 15, who said the timing ?looks awfully fishy.? But Bondi described the contribution, among the largest to her committee, as relatively routine. ?I was calling friends and family and many, many people because I was running for reelection,? Bondi said.",0.047297297,0.003378378,0.0067567569999999995,0.010135135,0.06418918900000001,0.30405405399999996,0.0,2,-1,1
"Nine years ago, a driver lost control of his pickup truck and crashed into the Confederate monument on the front lawn of the Franklin County Courthouse, decapitating the marble soldier. Some locals who found the monument offensive said they were glad to see it go, but there was never much doubt that once the money was raised, the soldier would be back. The rededication ceremony in 2010 drew a crowd of about 500people wore hoop skirts and men donned the gray uniforms of Confederate soldiers. ?We?re very proud of it,? says Linda Stanley, managing director of the Franklin County Historical Society in Rocky Mount, Virginia, 25 miles southeast of Roanoke. ?This wholecounty very, very patriotic.? Story Continued Below This was the way skirmishes over Confederate history have oftengone is replaced, not rewritten. That is, until last year, when white supremacist Dylann Roof gunned down nine people at an African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina. The massacre set off a national debate about Confederate symbols in public places, leading to an intense and ultimately successful campaign to permanently remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol grounds, where it had flown for decades. But for every nationally publicized debate like the one over SouthCarolina flag, there are dozens of smaller battles in places like Franklin County. And this is especially true in Virginia, which, as the former home to the capital of the Confederacy, has more Confederatemonuments?than any other state. Virginia, increasingly diverse and progressive, embodies the friction between the economic aspirations of the ?New South? and the still powerful nostalgia of the Old Dominion, andit a drama that is playing out in town squares across the state. Though a Quinnipiac University poll last summer found Virginians evenly divided on thegovernor decision to remove the Confederate flag from state license plates, pride in local monuments remains strong. When city leaders in Danville, onVirginia southern border, voted to remove a Confederate flag from the grounds of the SutherlinMansion as the Last Capitol of theConfederacy preservationists struck back. They filed a lawsuit seeking to have the flag reinstated, arguing that it was part of a war memorial, and that Virginia law protected all war memorials in the state. Last fall, a circuit court judge ruled against them. Thatruling with the increasingly frequent threats to monuments around thestate the Republican delegate from Franklin County to demand in January a blanket protection for what has been a feature of Southern urban landscapes for more than a century. Charles Poindexter introduced a bill in the General Assembly to prevent the removal of all war monuments, regardless of when they were built. ?If you eliminate these monuments and memorials,you taking away the opportunity to learn the history of thecountry learn the good, the bad and ugly,? Poindexter says. Many of his colleagues in the Virginia Legislature agreed with him. But in March, Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe vetoed the bill, saying cities and towns should decide what to do with their Confederate monuments, based on their individual histories. Some historians and civic leaders think the debate over Confederate symbols in public spaces, which began in the 1960s, will take decades to play out. ?Every littlestatue a part of a much larger discussion and movement,? says Edward Ayers, former president of the University of Richmond and noted Civil War historian. ?African-Americans now have a political voice, and this is one of the things thatthey using it for.? *** Mark Whitaker remembers walking by the 30-foot-tall Confederate monument in Portsmouth, Virginia, when he was a kid. Shopping at a store across the street, he resented looking at the obelisk guarded by stone soldiers; his parents had told him what it represented. ?My ancestors could not say a thing in the face of that indignity,? Whitaker says. Now, as an African-American City Council member in a city that is 53 percent black, he wants to remove the monument from the center of Olde Towne, and perhaps put it in a cemetery. ?These monuments are really a rally and a celebration [of] the rise of an institution that oppressed black people,? he says. Many of the Confederate monuments were built from the 1880s through the 1920s, an era when Civil War veterans were dying and their descendants were eager to honor them. It was also the era immediately following Reconstruction, when federal troops abandoned the South and whites aimed to reassert power through Jim Crow laws, lynchings and groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. Granite and marble monuments proclaimed that power, often in the center of town. But even in a majority-black city on the eastern shore of the state, Whitaker has battled to getPortsmouth monument removed. Last summer, attorney Fred Taylor, who also represented Confederate preservationists in the Danville case, warned the city that state law prohibited it from moving the monument. ?We believe the monument protection act covers the monument in Danville, covers the monument in Portsmouth,? Taylor says. He argues that the original Virginia statute protecting war monuments dates back to 1902, so ?there has been protection all along.? When the circuit court judge ruled against him in Danville, Taylor appealed the case to the Virginia Supreme Court. So far, the court has not agreed to hear the case. Back in Portsmouth, the debate continues. Some residentsdon want the city to spend upward of $100,000 to move themonument position Whitaker finds ridiculous. ?Why now, when we talk about moving a symbol of racism,we concerned about cost?? He says the Portsmouth City Council had been waiting to hear the outcome of the Danville court case but could resume its discussion of the monument after the November elections. ?We?re on solid legal grounds to remove it,? he says. ?We just need four votes.? *** Other Virginia cities have struck a middle ground, forming committees to figure out what to do with their Confederate monuments. In May, Charlottesville convened a Blue Ribbon Commission on Race, Memorials, and Public Spaces. Although the move was sparked by a controversial statue of Robert E. Lee in a public park, Mayor Mike Signer was determined to broaden the conversation, with an eye toward changing thecity entire historic landscape. He asked the commission to look at several landmarks, from an African-American cemetery that had fallen into disrepair to the statue of a Confederate boy in front of the courthouse. Members of the panel have discussed rehabbing and creating new historic interpretations for these sites, building new monuments to African-American leaders and linking all the sites so that visitors can see how they are connected. There might even be a virtual, mobile educational component to help people navigate the sites. The goal, Signer says, is to change the narrative of Charlottesville ?by telling the full story of race through our public spaces.? The commission is slated to give its recommendations to the City Council in December. In the wealthy, heavily Democratic city of Alexandria, a similar advisory group decided not to remove the Appomattox statue in the middle of Old Town, which depicts a defeated Confederate soldier with his eyes downcast. The United Daughters of the Confederacy owns the monument, and moving it would require approval from the Virginia General Assembly. Also, as the advisory group noted, Appomattox is one of the rare Confederate statues that marks a historicsite place where the 17th Virginia Regiment gathered to withdraw from Union occupation of the city in 1861. The group recommended labeling the statue with more historical context instead of taking it down. ?Black Lives Matter? is spray painted on a monument to former Confederate President Jefferson Davis in Richmond, Virginia, in June 2015. | AP Photo Richmond, the former capital of the Confederacy, has an entire street lined with monuments to Confederate leaders.It also a majority-black city. In June 2015, someone scrawled ?Black Lives Matter? on the statue of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Yet Mayor Dwight Jones has not called for the monuments? removal. Instead, he suggested adding more statues of prominent blackleaders as the bronze of tennis legend Arthur Ashe, who was born in Richmond, that the city erected in 1995. ?Rather than tearing down, we should be building up in ways that establish a proper sense of balance and fairness by recognizing heroes from all eras to tell a richer and more accurate story ofVirginia history,? Jones said in a statement last summer. Delegate Poindexter tends to agree with Jones, althoughhe fuzzy on the specifics. Asked whether he would be in favor of adding more historical context to existing Confederate monuments, he says, ?It?s far better than tearing down the current ones.? In his eyes, the era in which the Confederate monuments were erected is ?irrelevant.? ?They need to be respected,? he says. ?Theydidn know what we know today.That why these monuments are important.? Ayers says many people who push to preserve Confederate monuments share this attitude. ?The white South has always been on the defensive ever since it tried to leave the United States,? he says. ?They?ve taken what ground they can get, and what they can get is personal memory and memorialization.It an amalgam of power and weakness.? ?They?re meant to do work,? Ayers says. ?The work that they were meant to do, in some waysthey still doing: Saying that this is a place where local white people call the shots.? *** In Franklin County, the power struggle is deeply personal. Stanley says the area sent about 3,000 Confederate soldiers to what she calls ?The War Between the States.? Veterans who returned home became mayors and town clerks and delegates. Beginning in 1902, the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy started raising money for a memorial to honor the sons, fathers and husbands who never made it home. They dedicated the monument in front of the courthouse in 1910. One of the people who agreed to donate money to the project was Booker T. Washington, the famed African-American educator who was born into slavery on a farm in Franklin County in 1856. In 1905, he wrote a letter offering to contribute funds for the Confederate memorial, in honor of the family that owned him. As far as Stanley knows, Washington did contribute some amount, ?we justdon have a copy of the actual check.? Poindexter says Franklin County ?lost hundreds of its best men? in the Civil War, and for decades afterward, Reconstruction was ?a horrible process? that had a big impact on the region. Today, Franklin County is home to about 56,200 people, 90 percent of whom are white. They elected Poindexter, a conservative Christian with an Arating from the National Rifle Association, to the General Assembly for the first time in 2007. In 2014, the county had a median household income of $44,827, far below thestate median of $64,792. Its residents voted Republican in the past three presidential races, and many supportedPoindexter efforts to save war monuments. ?Wedidn want anybody pulling any monuments down,? Stanley says. Soon after the county replaced the Confederate memorial in front of the courthouse, the local chapter of the NAACP suggested that a statue of Booker T. Washington be erected beside it. Other community leaders wanted to put up a pedestal honoring African-Americans who contributed to thecounty Civil War effort. The county board of supervisors tabled their request, saying the community needed more time to discuss it. Civil War memorials are not generally a big tourist draw in the Roanoke region, says Landon Howard, president of VisitVirginia Blue Ridge. ?To be candid, we really do not get hardly any American Civil War visitation here.? Yet locals have their own loyalties. Every year, the Franklin County Historical Society celebrates Veterans Memorial Day, honoring all local casualties of military conflicts. According to thesociety website, ?Special emphasis is placed on veterans of the War Between the States as this war touched literally every household in the county.? Confederate General Jubal Early was born in Franklin County, andhe known as one of the rebels who never surrendered. ?He became the primary spokesman for the Lost Cause and became the overwhelming authority on published Confederate history,? says the website of the Jubal A. Early Homeplace. Speaking by phone from his farm in Franklin County, Poindexterisn ready to surrender, either. Hedoesn know whetherhe propose his monument protection bill again next year, but hehasn ruled it out. ?If you start tearing down monuments ... where do you stop?? he says. ?Youcan change what was, but you can learn from it and not make that mistake again.?

"NRA board member, draft-dodger, pedophile, and all-around terrible person Ted Nugent has a message for those embarrassingand patheticvictims of a recent mass-stabbing at a Minnesota mall ? andit one that no decent person would even consider. On September 17, an attacker apparently affiliated with ISIS stabbed nine people at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnetota. He was eventually fatally shot by an off-duty police officer. Fortunately, the victims? injuries were not life-threatening ? something most would celebrate, but Nugent deigns it appropriate to simply attack the victims because theydidn bring their guns to a knife-attack. In one of his traditionally hateful Facebook posts, Nugent unleashed on the victims in exactly the manner one would expect from a man who assumed legal custody of a 17-year-old girl so he could have sex with her. Calling the victims ?sad soulless & embarrassing,? Nugent mocked them for being ?so pathetic? and ?helpless,? remarking that ?apparently most Americans like being victims?: Previously, Nugent has attacked loserswhodon carry guns after the mass shooting at Umpqua community College in Oregon last year, blaming them for being victims because they choose not to carry a security blanket firearm around. Nugent falsely claimed that students were not allowed to carry guns on campus because of laws and regulations, but Newsweek reported at the time that the campus was not a ?gun-free zone? and that it was ?common knowledge? many students were armed. ?Disarmed and helpless is an irresponsible, suicidal choice that will get you killed,?

"Wouldn?t it be nice if we could just kick bigots out of our country? Well,that exactly what happened when anti-gay Arizona pastor Stephen Anderson stopped by Botswana for a visit and decided to preach hate.Anderson road to Botswana was an eventful one, with the United Kingdom banning him from so much as getting on a connecting flight in their country. This forced him to find a roundaboutway to get to Botswana, where he intended to spend quite some time preaching. But after he suggested that homosexuals be stoned to death in a radio interview, Anderson learned that his hatred is not tolerated everywhere. ?I have identified Steven Anderson as an undesirable person to travel to South Africa,? Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba told the BBC. Thecountry Constitution, unlike ours, prohibits hate speech against, among other things, the gay community (even though homosexual acts are illegal in Botswana) ? and ifyou ever listened to Anderson speak for five minutes straight, you know hate speech is kind of his ?thing.? The government even tweeted to inform everyone he had been declared a ?prohibited immigrant?: Pastor #StevenAnderson, a #USA citizen has been declared a Prohibited Immigrant and as such is being deported from #Botswana ? Botswana Government (@BWGovernment) September 20, 2016 What prompted his removal was a radio interview in which he said homosexuals should be ?stoned to death.? Anderson also repeated his praise of the Pulse nightclub shooter. While he says hedoesn advocate violence, the victims were ?disgusting homosexuals who the Bible says are worthy of death, the Bible says the government should put them to death, so why would I be sad if these horrible people died that the Bible says should die anyway.? Anderson told his interviewer, who pointed out that the Bible supports slavery, that while hedoesn believe the Bible condones slavery (it does), ?if it did then yes I would condone it? because ?the Bible is always right and I am not smarter than God.? In the past, Anderson has blamed the terrorist attacks in France earlier this year on thecountry acceptance of ?f*ggots,? has called the Orlando massacre ?good news? because a bunch of ?f*ggots? died (he later expanded on that by adding that ?perfect Christians? would bathein the blood of the slaughtered innocents while singing praise to God), has prayed for the death of President Obama and asked God to rip out CaitlynJenner heart and even suggested executing every gay person in the world ?to cure AIDS.?

"When Donald Trump talks about America, he often talks about how wedon ?win anymore.? Wedon win on manufacturing. Wedon win on trade. Wedon win on economics. Wedon win against ISIS.It that last point I wish to address, because Trump said at a recent rally: ?Our militarycan beat ISIS. Can you imagine the great General Douglas MacArthur or the great General George Patton saying wecan beat ISIS. Patton would rip your heart out if you ever said that. Wecan beat ? right? Can you imagine that though? Can you imagine what ?they spinning right now.They watching.They spinning in their grave.? You, Donnie Trump, go on, and speak like MacArthur and Patton talk to you. You sound likeyou assured them you can win here, andyou do them proud. Is that how you see it, Donnie?You ignoring an awful lot there, Donnie. Neither MacArthur nor Patton behaved the way you do. They were tacticians, not juggernauts who rolled to victory in every single engagement. They knew when to steamroll, and when to pull back and regroup. In your crusade against anything that even remotely looks like weakness,you taught your dense and idiotic followers that winning against ISIS is as simple as a football game. Simply act like we can win, andwe win.I sure that our dear Mr. Trump does not see anything wrong with talking this way. After all, nothing he ever does is wrong. Period. End of. However, the problem is not how he sees it. The problem is the messagehe putting forth.He treating war, and terrorism, likethey football games. If we just think positively, believe we can win, and stop acting like wecan beat ISIS,we beat them handily.That not true. Generals Patton and MacArthur were so successful in part because they were realistic. There were massive failures during WWII. We did not ride in on this white horse to save the day. However, Donnie disgustingly buys into that very narrative. Wedidn. MacArthur was already in the Philippines when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. In the ensuing months, he suffered grievous defeats. He actually ordered a withdrawal to Australia to regroup. He was human. His troops were human. Japan was a juggernaut at the time, and wecouldn beat them with brute force. What do you think of that, Donnie? MacArthur actually ordered a retreat.Isn that giving up?Isn that whatyou railing against? MacArthur is remembered as great because of things like this. Not in spite of them, and definitely not because theydidn happen. Thenthere Patton. He does seem to have been more the style that you see in your head. For instance,he reported to have said: ?We shall attack and attack until we are exhausted, and then we shall attack again.? Yet he was surrounded by controversy over his leadership methods. Congress and the military actually demanded his removal from command after he slapped a soldier who was suffering from battle fatigue. There were other such incidents, too, but his qualifications are what kept him in the field. He might have stormed through battle zones like Bastogne (do you even know which battle that was, Donnie?), ending them, but he was far from perfect. Donnie, all you do is talk about winning and losing, and yet, nobody has ever conceded defeat to ISIS. Nobody in U.S. leadership has said, ?Wecan beat ISIS.? Not our president, not our current commanders. A coach telling his football team ?Wecan do this,? hands the game to the other team. Our militarydoesn operate like that, however. It never has. It operates with the understanding that there will be defeats. Learning from those defeats is key to beating ISIS ? something you would know if youweren such a conceited bastard. On the ground, unit commanders, all the way down to squad leaders, will give pep talks. Yes, that is normal, and you and I both know it. However, those who are guiding the entire war have to be realistic, or they will end up losing it, and they know it.It not a football game. ISIS is not WWII, andit definitely not a game, Donnie. Your treating it as suchdoesn just show astonishing arrogance, but it also shows thatyou wholly unqualified to be the Commander in Chief of the U.S. military. You will never be able to understand how anything works as long as you keep treating everything as winning versus losing. As thoughit a goddamn football game.It not.

" The first debate showdown of Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was expected to be a brutal altercation between the two candidates. Instead, the viewing audience was treated to a one-sided destruction with Clinton appearing cool and presidential, while Trump gave the worst debate performance in presidential history. Each candidate had the ability to invite guests for moral support, and Clinton invited billionaire Mark Cuban who has been one of the loudest voices against Trump in the media. There is no love lost between the two businessmen, and Cuban even said of Trump there was ?no bigger jagoff in the world.? The indebted businessman happily admitted on stage in front of Cuban to being in debt at least $600 million. The shameless Trump, who became more unhinged as the night progressed, freely gave away one of his biggest secrets ? that he does not and has not paid any federal taxes in years. Clinton speculated about this, and like a predictable rube under the hot lights Trump cracked under the pressure. Rather than offer an explanation or deflection toClinton hypothesis Trump agreed he paid no taxes and said, ?That makes me smart.?Trump cheap explanation sounded like something a third grader on the playground would offer rather than a presidential candidate. An hour after the debate Trump immediately began walking back his statement, and denied he had ever said it. This type of shamelessness is difficult to combat. When asked , ?It sounds like you admitted youhaven paid federal taxes and that was smart. Is that what you meant to say?? Trump replied, ?No, Ididn say that at all.? Trump insulted every American who pays their fair share of taxes and Cuban was not amused nor impressed. After the debate Cuban said: I get audited every year my taxes are ? it takes me 45 minutes just to sign all the different taxes that I have to spend. And I tell my tax lawyers and everybody, you know, take advantage of ? do what the law recommends. ButI not against paying taxes. AndI give you a perfect example. When the Dallas Mavericks were building a new practice facility which was just opening I had the opportunity to go to Dallas and and play different cities against each other to get different rebates and everything. Ididn do it. A couple years ago we had some issues in Dallas, I just wrote a check to the general treasury. This year we had, after the shootings in Orlando, I had concerns about the LGBT community in Dallas. I just wrote a million dollar check to the city of Dallas to support a bunch of different programs.I,I the luckiest guy in the world.There nobodywho been as blessed as me and my family, so far, knock on wood, is healthy, and at some point you have to realize you have to give back. And you have to realize that this is a countrythat been great to us. And youcan just take, take, take, take, take, take. .@mcuban on Trump saying not paying taxes makes him smart #debatenight pic.twitter.com/uPNunatukV ? Stefan Becket (@becket) September 27, 2016 The contrast between Cuban and Trump could not be more stark. Cuban believes in paying his fair share to society to help those who are less fortunate than him, while admitting he owes his success to society. Trump is content and even proud that he bleeds society for as much money as possible, while offering to pay back nothing. Did Trump say he was interested in paying higher taxes? No. Did Trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes? No. Trump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent, because if they did they would certainly not support him. Trump has no interest in paying taxes to help pay for the roads which are used to deliver the cheaply made Chinese goods to which his name is affixed. InTrump world there is a two-tiered system.

Police said the man fatally shot, identified as Keith Lamont Scott, was not the suspect officers sought but had exited from a vehicle with a firearm and the officers believed he posed an imminent deadly threat. Scott's family quickly challenged the police account of the shooting, saying that he was not armed and that he was holding a book and waiting for his son to be dropped off from school, WSOC-TV reports. Detectives say they recovered at the scene the firearm they believe Scott was holding at the time of the shooting, WSOC-TV reported.

A mass shooting so bad that one must wonder how one person was able to take out so many unsuspecting concert goers. It makes you wonder if there was more than one shooter. What about that security guard who went missing? What about the rumors that people shot at a tower hoping for an explosion? Was Stephen Paddock the shooter at all? Was his girlfriend Marilou Danley involved? Was she running around outside warning people about something? New evidence leaks from Vegas that has possible crucial information that might lead to more answers the public so desperately seeks. Authorities identified her fingerprints on the ammunition, and her casino card was in the hotel room. That leads people to wonder about her involvement in the crime. Was she ever in that dreaded hotel room? Was the ammo handled at another location? Did Paddock bring her card to throw her under the bus? What part did Danley play in the atrocious shooting? Or was she a patsy? Was Paddock a patsy? Half of the victims of the Las Vegas shooting were not given an autopsy. Why? Trajectory. Number of bullet wounds. Apparently our dead lone shooter Paddock had an over 80% headshot rate. Manliker Carcano No marksman has ever reenacted Dealey successfully with one. ? Bill Chapman Fmr Film Biz Now Truth Seeker (@bchapman151) January 12, 2018 Some investigators crawled throughDanley social media and email accounts. Stephen Paddock reportedly had access to at least one of the accounts in question. More information comes out and maybe one day we can piece this horrible puzzle together. LA Times reports: ?Marilou Danley may not have been present when Paddock unleashed a furious barrage of bullets down on a crowd of 20,000 at a Las Vegas country music festival, killing 58 people and wounding more than 500 others, but her links to his life seemed to be everywhere. The facts about Danley were among the details revealed when a U.S. District Court judge in Las Vegas unsealed more than 300 pages of search warrants and affidavits at the request of several media outlets, including the Los Angeles Times. The request was unopposed by prosecutors. But why the 64-year-old Paddock shot up the Route 91 Harvest festival on Oct. 1 remains a mystery, and the search warrants ? despite revealing his large cache of weaponry ? raise more questions than answers about his actions and motive. Paddock came to Las Vegas with an arsenal ? more than 20 firearms and hundreds of rounds of ammunition and spent casings were found in his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino. Other search warrants revealed more than 1,000 rounds and 100 pounds of explosive material in his car. Authorities also recovered 18 firearms and more than 1,000 rounds atPaddock house in Mesquite, Nev. A ?large quantity of firearms? was recovered from another residence he had in Reno. The search warrants also covered electronic accounts and social media accounts of Paddock and Danley. They revealed an exchange about a money wire transfer. Danley returned from a trip to the Philippines days after the shooting, butwasn arrested when she arrived in the United States. According to an affidavit, Danley was identified early on ?as the most likely person who aided or abetted Stephen Paddock based on her informing law enforcement that her fingerprints would likely be found on the ammunition used during the attack.? In the court documents, she told investigators she occasionally participated in the loading of the magazines.? Danley loaded magazines on weapons that may have been responsible for a mass amount of bloodshed. Authorities have not arrested her yet, but Danley is a person of interest. My theory is that the authorities are keeping a watchful eye on her to see what she does, who she talks to, and if any of her activity leads people to a much more significant arrest. What was Paddock doing with all those guns in one location? Hecan possibly shoot them all at once, nor would he survive a gunfight with police long enough to use all the ammunition. What were the weapons really for? What wasPaddock real story? Was he a gun runner on a deal that went bad? Was he shot before the shooting started? What happened during that concert in Vegas that set the stage for the horrible shooting?

"On Monday, Donald Trump fulfilled his duty as a presidential candidate by praising law enforcement for catching Ahmad Khan Rahami, who was responsible for the Saturday bombing in New York City. This would have normally been a nice gesture, if ithadn been a contradiction of something Trump had said just a few minutes before. Fortunately, whenever Trump flip-flops or lies, Americans are able to instantly respond and call him out on his bullsh*t via social media ? and theydidn hesitate to remind Trump that just a few minutes before he congratulated law enforcement forRahami capture,he dissed the NYPD for allowing ?political correctness? to interfere with catching terrorists. Among the first to point this out wasMSNBC Christopher Hayes, who tweeted: Hayes was referring to a disrespectful comment Trump had made on Fox and Friends shortly before he congratulated the police officers, in which he said: ?You know, our police are amazing, our local police. They know who a lot of these people are, they are afraid to do anything about it, because theydon want to be accused of profiling, and theydon want to be accused of all sorts of things.? Yup ? Trump had accused the NYPD of being cowards and knowing who terrorists are, yet he has the nerve to congratulate them in almost the same time frame. Other people recognized this epic fail as well, and blasted the Republican nominee for being so untrustworthy and two-faced: This tweet was particularly funny, andI sure there will be some backlash for Trump to deal with: Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump has defended law enforcement far more fiercely than African American police brutality victims to help paint the picture that he is a ?law and order? candidate. But thanks to his asinine comments about law enforcement having blood on their hands by assisting terrorists, Trump has probably just ruined a year of pro-law enforcement campaigning.

" NewJersey despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the Bridgegatescandal by a judge, as WNYC reports: The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict. Chris Christie is also RepublicanPresidential nominee DonaldTrump transition team chairperson. Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of theworld busiest bridges. Governor Christie wasTrump most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major conservativeRepublican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended onTrump benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor. Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail.It have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the RepublicanGovernor the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town. Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages. The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about hisadministration bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of thisyear Republican Presidential campaign.

"The Third Circuit ruled on Monday that the trial will be delayed while Sen. Bob Menendez petitions the Supreme Court to hear his appeal. | Getty Menendez's bribery trial delayed as he seeks Supreme Court intervention The bribery and corruption trial for New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez will be delayed while he seeks Supreme Court intervention in his case, a federal court has ordered. The Justice Dept. had asked that Menendez's trial move ahead after the Third Circuit of Appeals rejected his bid to the have the allegations against him thrown out. Story Continued Below But the Third Circuit ruled on Monday that the trial will be delayed while Menendez petitions the Supreme Court to hear his appeal. That means that any trial ? if it does take place ? likely won't happen before 2017. Menendez was indicted in April 2015 for allegedly accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in improper gifts and campaign contributions as bribes in exchange for using his office to help Dr. Salomon Melgen, a longtime friend and major campaign contributor. The Justice Dept. alleges Menendez received nearly $1 million worth of gifts and campaign contributions from Melgen. In turn, Menendez allegedly intervened onMelgen behalf in a multimillion-dollar billing dispute with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and attempted to enforce a $500 million port security contract with the Dominican Republic, as well as obtaining visa applications for several ofMelgen girlfriends. Menendez has argued that under the Speech or Debate clause ? a constitutional privilege that shields lawmakers and staff from legal action over legitimate legislative activities ? he could not be charged with improperly aiding Melgen. He asked the Third Circuit to overrule a lower court, which had let the Justice Department's case against him move forward.

"Election Day may be more than six weeks away but, starting today, some voters can cast votes at a physical polling place as statewide in-person, no-excuse voting gets underway in Minnesota and South Dakota. With more than two-thirds of states offering some kind of early voting, the practice will trend upward in 2016, as it has in recent decades, and will play a major factor in battleground state ballots, some election experts predict. An estimated 34 percent of voters will vote early, according to Michael McDonald, a political science professor at the University of Florida and fellow at the Brookings Institution. The steep climb in early voting has resulted from states? making early voting more widely available, along with incremental year-to-year increases as voters become more familiar with early-vote procedures, McDonald told ABC News. Watch the first presidential debate on ABC News and ABCNews.com at 9 p.m. ET. on Monday. While all states offer absentee voting, 37 states and Washington, D.C., will allow some form of early in-person voting this year before Election Day, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Early voting comprises both early absentee voting and early in-person voting. New York, South Carolina and Michigan are among the states that don't allow early, no-excuse voting. Voting early offers flexibility and convenience to voters who may not be able to show up to the polls on Nov. 8, or prefer to avoid long lines on Election Day. Whatever the motivation, early voting is likely to make up a significant chunk of the total vote in some key battleground states, Josh Putnam of the election blog Frontloading HQ told ABC News. He expects large early turnout in Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Nevada and North Carolina. High early-vote turnout in battleground states is borne out by data from the previous elections. In 2012, early voting made up more than half the overall vote in Florida, Nevada and North Carolina. In Georgia, early voting accounted for 48 percent of the overall 2012 vote, and in Iowa that percent grew to 43 percent in 2012, up from 35 percent in 2008. While Ohio traditionally does not have a big early vote, more than 524,000 absentee ballots had been requested as of this week, according to The Associated Press. That marks an 8 percent increase of 40,000 compared to this time in the last presidential election. Early voting in Ohio in 2012 and 2008 comprised some 30 percent of the overall vote.

"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed ?watered-down? HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and ?likely increased? the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,?The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,? was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the ClintonFoundation most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. The congressional report focused onClinton decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company. ?This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and thenation largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,? said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty. ?When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of theFDA approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,? said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company. The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, ?alleged due to thecompany diluted drugs, it ?subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,?? according to the report. ?The question becomes, ?how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,?? asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF. The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate HillaryClinton campaign. Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President BarackObama first term. The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the ClintonFoundation vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the ?watered-down? drugs. ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered ?more than $1.8 million packages.? ?Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,? Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF. Thakur told TheDCNF that many of thecompany anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients. ?These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,? he said.Ranbaxy first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report. The FDA sent a public ?warning letter? to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in thecompany quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, ?show much lower potencies in these batches.? AlthoughRanbaxy generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute thecompany HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad. Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives. Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy. Thakur saidhe now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on accessto patients. The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. ?I have tried to reach out to them,? he told TheDCNF. ?But Ihaven had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.? CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations. Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was ?deeply suspect.? ?In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called CHAIwas by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,? Ortel told TheDCNF. The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order. He signed an executive order that, ?relaxed intellectual property policy standards,? promising the U.S. government ?would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ?Sub-Saharan country? relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,? the report states. CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.CHAI endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under thePresident Emergency Plan for AIDS relief ? a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush. The flow of U.S. funds combined withClinton endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become ?good acquisition targets,? according to the study. Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs. The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they ?exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,? the report states. The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions. One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001. Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial. Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.

"Sanders planning a ?very, very vigorous? Clinton stump schedule Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is planning a ?very, very vigorous? travel schedule to campaign on behalf of Hillary Clinton in the weeks leading up to the November election, he said Monday.

"Donald Trump makes a visit to Stamey's Barbecue on Sept. 20 in Greensboro, North Carolina. | AP Photo Trump forces lagged Clinton in August money race But Trump finally showed signs of building a more conventional political infrastructure. Even as Donald Trump and his allies ramped up their fundraising and political infrastructure in August, their combined monthly fundraising haul lagged $42 million behind that of HillaryClinton forces, according to a POLITICO analysis of reports filed Tuesday with the Federal Election Commission. The Trump campaign, two supportive super PACs and the Republican National Committee pulled in a combined $70 million, relying largely on small donors, during the tumultuous month of August, when his campaign shook up its leadership in an attempt to reboot after a chaotic nominating convention in July. Story Continued Below By contrast, the Clinton campaign, an allied super PAC and the Democratic National Committee, leaning heavily on major donors, raised a total of $112 million in August, as her campaign rode a strong bounce from its tightly choreographed, star-studded convention.Trump forces entered September with almost $96 million in the bank, whileClinton started the month with $121.4 million, according toPolitico analysis. The analysis does not include fundraising tallies for the joint fundraising committees the rival candidates created with their respective parties, nor does it include the fundraising hauls from some supportive super PACs. All of those committees disclose their finances on a quarterly basis, meaning theywon be required to file detailed financial reports until Oct. 15. But the analysis provides revealing hints about the contrasting strategies employed by the presidential candidates and their allies. The joint fundraising committee that Trump created with the RNC appears to be sitting on a significant sum of cash ? perhaps as much as $47 million at the end of last month ? while distributing only $12 million to the RNC itself and $20 million toTrump campaign. That transfer to Trump accounted for nearly half his August total ? the first timehe received such a large portion of his cash that way. Clinton, on the other hand, received $31.4 million from her own joint fundraising vehicle, and the Democratic National Committee received $12 million. An additional $12 million appear to have gone to state parties but been rerouted to the DNC, repeating a pattern from previous months. (The DNC also transferred out some $14 million to various state parties in August.)Trump campaign, which had largely eschewed spending on the trappings of political tactics, showed early signs of implementing a more conventional operation under its new leadership. It spent serious money ? $5.3 million ? on paid media in August, most of which went through Rick Reed Media, though $718,000 went through Jamestown Associates, the firm of his then-new senior communications adviser Jason Miller. That was dwarfed by the $32.7 million that Clinton paid her media buyer, GMMB, in August. Trump spent almost $1 million on field consultants, up from $432,000 in July. And hiscampaign staff grew to 140 people, with a total payroll of $643,000, up from $392,000 for 84 people in July. But that still trailedClinton 789-person, $3.3 million payroll. Trump more than doubled his spending on field consulting in August to $973,000. The campaign also paid for polling, something it had been reluctant to do, directing $128,500 to the firm of Kellyanne Conway, who took over as campaign manager late in the month. And it spent $250,000 on data services provided by Cambridge Analytica, a firm owned largely by the influential Mercer family , which played a pivotal role inTrump campaign shakeup and is spearheading one of the super PACs backing the campaign. Still, the campaign continued devoting serious cash to bankroll the former reality TVstar traveling show: $2 million went for rally-related expenses including facility rentals, audio-visual services, and event staging and consulting. Then, of course, there was the spending on Trump branding, which included $420,00 on hats and $1.7 million on T-shirts and other merchandise. And the campaign spent $547,000 on services provided byTrump own companies, including $170,000 for rent at Trump Tower and $319,000 on TAG Air Inc. By contrast, Trump spent only $80,000 on strategy consulting, with the firm of fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski receiving $20,000 of that. And thecampaign largest expense continued to be online advertising and fundraising payments to the Austin-based digital firm ofTrump digital director Brad Parscale, who is running thecampaign online fundraising and advertising efforts, despite having no prior political experience. His firm reaped $11.1 million in August ? up nearly $3 million from July and good for a third of all thecampaign spending. Although the online fundraising effort overseen by Parscale helped produce an impressive small-dollar haul in which 65 percent of thecampaign contributions came in amounts of less than $200, the payments to Giles-Parscale suggest the campaign has spent heavily on list rentals, email solicitations and online advertising to round up those small contributions. The percentage of cash that Clinton raised from small donors was half ofTrump. About 31 percent of her cash came in checks of less than $200, which actually marked a slight improvement over her average across the cycle. Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine focused in August on big-dollar fundraisers in exclusive summer destinations. Likewise, the main super PAC supporting Clinton, Priorities USA, drew more than half of its $23.4 million August haul from its top five donors: Slim-Fast founder Daniel Abraham and Newsweb chairman Fred Eychaner ($3 million each), billionaire financier George Soros ($2.5 million), investor Donald Sussman and Laurene Powell Jobs? Emerson Collective (both with $2 million). Trump received some good news this week about the fundraising of his own high-dollar super PACs. Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who had been sitting out the cycle so far, and his wife, Miriam, reportedly committed $5 million to a pro-Trump super PAC effort, but the group to which he has pledged the cashhasn launched the effort and itwon disclose its finances until next month. The other super PACs supporting Trump have continued to lag in fundraising. Make America Number 1, the pro-Trump super PAC run by the Mercer family, received $1 million from Cherna Moskowitz, a Miami philanthropist, and $50,000 from Erik Prince, who founded the defense contractor Blackwater. But itdidn receive any other big checks anddidn get a dime in August from the Mercer family, which had donated $2 million to the PAC in July. Another pro-Trump super PAC, Great America PAC, appears to have thecampaign blessing after Eric Trump, thecandidate son, attended one of its events . But it raised only $3.6 million in August, including $250,000 from RHS Investments, a Texas company that appears to be tied to banking executive Robert H. Seale, and $200,000 from Martin Harmon of Rocklin, Calif. The Committee to RestoreAmerica Greatness and Rebuilding America Now ? other pro-Trump super PACs ?won disclose their financials until next month because they report on a quarterly cycle. The same goes for pro-Clinton groups American Bridge and Correct the Record.",0.013129103,0.001094092,0.002188184,0.008752735,0.020787746,0.166301969,0.001094092,2,-1,1

"Story highlights A top aide to John Kasich slammed the chair of the Republican Party in a statement late Sunday RNC Chair Reince Priebus had warned of consequences for not backing nominee (CNN) A top aide to Ohio Gov. John Kasich criticized Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus after the party chairman warned of consequences for former presidential candidates like Kasich who've refused to back Donald Trump for president, despite signing loyalty pledges during the primary. ""The idea of a greater purpose beyond oneself may be alien to political party bosses like Reince Priebus, but it is at the center of everything Governor Kasich does,"" said John Weaver, Kasich's chief strategist. ""He will not be bullied by a Kenosha political operative that is unable to stand up for core principles or beliefs."" Weaver was responding to Priebus' appearance on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday. During that interview, the RNC chairman suggested that GOP presidential candidates who'd signed pledges to back the eventual Republican nominee during the 2016 primary, but who have since withheld support for Trump's candidacy, could be prevented from running for president again by the party.

" It is an inarguable fact that law enforcement in the United States kill far too many citizens. Police officers in the United States have killed 706 people in summary executions without due process of the law; well on target to pass lastyear grisly total of 990. Our police officers shoot and kill people at a rate seventy times that of other developed countries, and that is absolutely unacceptable. The United Kingdom had 55 fatal police shootings in the past 24 years; American police murdered that many citizens in the first 24 days of 2015. The appalling frequency of unarmed black men being gunned down by overzealous police officers whodon even bother to attempt to take them in peacefully prompts even more questions. Why are our cops so trigger-happy? One veteran thinks it may have something to do with their training. The frequency of violence by American police officers can be partially blamed with the outrageous proliferation of firearms among a irresponsible civilian population leading to more cops being killed in the line of duty, as Republican nominee Donald Trump loves to spout ? whenhe not busy telling you how Hillary Clinton is coming for your guns. But the number of deaths in the line of duty for police officers is down 17% since President Obama took office, hovering around 60 a year. Police departments cultivate this ?shoot first and ask questions later? policy and have developed a wide array of tools to insulate themselves from facing consequences for their crimes. They do this to cover up the fact that the reality is that our police forces receive astonishingly poor training ? less than is required to become a cosmetologist. A cosmetologist in Alabama requires 50 weeks of training. A soldier in Alabama completes ten weeks of basic training and then fifty-two weeks of advanced specialization training. A police officer in Alabama requires twelve weeks of training. On the other hand, a police officer in Norway requires two years of training. See the difference?

"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed ?watered-down? HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and ?likely increased? the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,?The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,? was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the ClintonFoundation most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. The congressional report focused onClinton decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company. ?This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and thenation largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,? said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty. ?When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of theFDA approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,? said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company. The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, ?alleged due to thecompany diluted drugs, it ?subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,?? according to the report. ?The question becomes, ?how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,?? asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF. The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate HillaryClinton campaign. Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President BarackObama first term. The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the ClintonFoundation vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the ?watered-down? drugs. ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered ?more than $1.8 million packages.? ?Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,? Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF. Thakur told TheDCNF that many of thecompany anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients. ?These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,? he said.Ranbaxy first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report. The FDA sent a public ?warning letter? to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in thecompany quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, ?show much lower potencies in these batches.? AlthoughRanbaxy generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute thecompany HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad. Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives. Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy. Thakur saidhe now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on accessto patients. The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. ?I have tried to reach out to them,? he told TheDCNF. ?But Ihaven had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.? CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations. Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was ?deeply suspect.? ?In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called CHAIwas by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,? Ortel told TheDCNF. The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order. He signed an executive order that, ?relaxed intellectual property policy standards,? promising the U.S. government ?would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ?Sub-Saharan country? relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,? the report states. CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.CHAI endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under thePresident Emergency Plan for AIDS relief ? a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush. The flow of U.S. funds combined withClinton endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become ?good acquisition targets,? according to the study. Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs. The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they ?exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,? the report states. The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions. One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001. Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial. Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval. Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the ?false hopes? offered by the Clinton Foundation. ?You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To meit disturbing and very sad,? she said.

The events following Monday's shooting have reignited a national debate about police and race relations. After two nights of protests grew increasingly violent in Charlotte, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency Wednesday in an attempt to ease tensions. Forty-four arrests were made in that span, with numerous injuries sustained by police officers and one protester fatally wounded in a civilian shooting. Obama also addressed the growing sentiment of injustice felt by many in the African-American community in the wake of another fatal shooting in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ?I think it's important to separate out the pervasive sense of frustration among a lot of African Americans about shootings of people and the sense that justice is not always color blind,? he said. According to the White House President Obama has spoken over the phone to Charlotte mayor Jennifer Roberts as well as McCrory to express his condolences and offer any further federal assistance.",0.021929825,0.004385965,0.004385965,0.004385965,0.070175439,0.28508771899999996,0.004385965,2,-1,1
"Police Union Asks Deputies To Not Escort Dolphins Until TheTeam Players Stand For AnthemHere the thing: one does not have to love America. This is a free country and if one feels the need to disrespect this nation, there are not ? nor should there be ? legal consequences. However,let be very clear: there is no law that mandates that people should be able to say whatever they want, whenever they want and remain free from encountering consequences. If I told my boss to shove it, it would be wrong for me to end up in jail for the supposed crime. However, is it not fair that I should be fired or otherwise demoted or reprimanded?

"Story highlights Trump said avoidance of paying taxes shows he's a successful businessman Though he hasn't released his tax returns Washington (CNN) When Hillary Clinton said that her Republican rival Donald Trump had paid no federal income tax in some years, Trump didn't deny it. In fact, he said: ""That makes me smart."" After the debate, he told CNN's Jim Acosta: ""Of course I've paid federal taxes."" Clinton was pressing Trump for not releasing his tax returns for public scrutiny.

"A Syrian human rights group said today that at least 32 people had been killed and dozens injured in Aleppo, Syria, and its western suburbs in the hours after Syria's military declared the U.S.-Russian brokered cease-fire over. Interested in Syria? Add Syria as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Syria news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest After the Syrian military blamed rebels for not observing the truce, which was in its seventh day, the United Nations said a convoy transporting aid to the hard-hit city had been attacked, with 18 of the convoy's 31 trucks initially believed to have been hit. The rights group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said that 12 people had been killed when the convoy was struck. Farhan Haq, a deputy spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, told ABC News that he could not confirm any information on potential casualties or the cause of the attack. He said that the United Nations' initial understanding was that a warehouse operated by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent had also been hit along with the convoy, before the trucks could distribute any aid to 78,000 people whom international groups had hoped to reach. The fighting came amid signs the cease-fire was falling apart, with Russia casting doubt on it and the Syrian military declaring its conclusion. But U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, speaking to reporters in New York City, disputed the notion that the cease-fire had ended and redirected his frustrations toward the Russians. ""We have not had seven days of calm and delivery of humanitarian goods, and so it'd be good if they didn't talk first to the press but if they talked to the people who are actually negotiating this,"" Kerry said. ""And I think it's -- as I said yesterday -- time to end the grandstanding and time to do the real work of delivering on the humanitarian goods that are necessary for access. So we just began today to see real movement of humanitarian goods, and let's see where we are, and we're happy to have a good conversation with them about how to proceed."" Kerry is in New York City for the United Nations General Assembly, where international leaders will discuss the world's refugee crisis in a large part caused by the five-year Syrian war. In a statement, State Department spokesman John Kirby stressed that the U.S. was waiting to hear from Russia on the current state of the cease-fire. ""While we have seen comments attributed to the Syrian military, our arrangement is with Russia, which is responsible for the Syrian regime's compliance, so we expect Russia to clarify their position,"" he said. Before today's declaration by the Syrian military, the cease-fire was already on shaky ground, with reports of violations on both sides. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the besieged city of Aleppo was hit by at least four airstrikes on Sunday. The group also reported that convoys carrying humanitarian aid shipments had not received permission to enter the city, which desperately needs them. Aleppo is home to nearly 2 million people who lack regular access to water and electricity. An estimated 250,000 to 275,000 people live in areas held by anti-government rebels that have been a focus of intense airstrikes and artillery bombardment. Additionally, on Saturday the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS halted an airstrike in eastern Syria that the Russian Defense Ministry said killed 62 Syrian government soldiers and injured 100 others. A U.S. defense official told ABC News that the strike was supposed to target a collection of vehicles and personnel believed to belong to ISIS. The airstrike was halted after Russia communicated to the coalition that it was Syrian forces that were being struck. Australia, Denmark and the United Kingdom have acknowledged that their aircraft participated in the strike. A senior Obama administration official told ABC News that the U.S. ""relayed our regret"" to the Syrian government through Russian officials. According to a U.S. defense official, the leading theory is that the Syrian forces hit in the airstrike may have been conscripts or prisoners wearing civilian clothes, not regular Syrian Army uniforms. The cease-fire must be renewed every 48 hours. The last extension was on Friday.

"Donald Trump constantly talks about howhe ?make America great again.?He bring jobs back, put America first, all that populist, nationalist jazz that put him in the position of being the Republican nominee in the first place. However,there one thing Trump can do to help Americans get more jobs: he can actually make his own products in the United States of America. Well, since Trumpwon readily make his manufacturing practices available to the American public on his own campaign website, Hillary has given us a handy guide complete with images, on hers. She calls it ?ABuyer Guide For Donald Trump.? While Donald Trump says that ?it?s very hard to have apparel made in this country,? or ?theydon even make the stuff here.It so hard to get.? Hillary proves him wrong right away.

For instance,here all the places Trump can make ties: Instead, he makes them in China. And that is just one example. Go toHillary website for a full list. In other words,Trump rhetoric is just that: bluster and bombaste for the sake of excusing his anti-American business practices.

"Democrats are confident the rising salience of terrorism and police shootings of African-Americans this week will benefit Hillary Clinton. Republicans, meanwhile, believe overwhelmingly that Donald Trump will win the terrorism argument but are less confident that he'll react in a measured way to the recent protests in North Carolina.That according to The POLITICO Caucus ? a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 11 key battleground states. More than three-in-four Democratic insiders believe Clinton will benefit from the increasing prominence of both issues. And while majorities of Republicans, on the other hand, think both issues will help Trump,there less confidence that he can strike the right balance between law enforcement and the aggrieved African-American community. Story Continued Below On terrorism and national security, the results were fell along party lines: 76 percent of Democrats said Clinton stands to benefit from the issue, compared to 81 percent of Republicans who said it would help Trump. That mirrors public polling that shows voters divided on which candidate they trust more on the issue ? with a slight edge for Clinton, particularly on temperament and ability to be commander-in-chief. ?Polls show that folks do not trust Trump to have his finger on the button,? said one Wisconsin Democrat ? who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. ?That to me says it all.? A Pennsylvania Democrat added thatTrump criticism of military leadership for their prosecution of the overseas battle against the Islamic State has alienated key voters in their state. ?Trump's open disrespect of the military doesn't play well among the same base he's supposed to be courting ? the disaffected Western [Pennsylvania] voters,? the Democrat said. But some Democrats are concerned that rising anxieties about terrorism ? if they were to persist for the next six-and-a-half weeks ? could benefit Trump. ?We have an older electorate, plus still some conservative white Democrats,? said a Florida Democrat. ?In a close race, fear can win out.? Republicans, meanwhile, said Trump can effectively tie Clinton to President Barack Obama ? who, despite rising approval ratings overall, rates poorly on his handling of national security. ?People who are angry and afraid feel that way because of the Obama-Clinton policies that created [ISIL] and allowed the wave of domestic terror to occur largely unchecked,? said an Ohio Republican. ?She's counting on experienceand ?being there in the situation room,?? said a Michigan Republican. ?I think that works against her and solidifies that she's part of the problem.? On the other burgeoning issue this week ? the police-involved shootings in Tulsa, Okla., and Charlotte, N.C. ? majorities of Democrats again defaulted to their partisan leanings. But Republicans were less certain the issue would help Trump ? only 61 percent said it would ? compared to the larger majority that said it would benefit Clinton, 77 percent. (Reponses were filed between 5 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, prior to the beginning of a second night of rioting in Charlotte, and 2 p.m. Thursday.) Democrats mostly said the issue allowed Clinton to strengthen her appeal to minority voters ? and, potentially, for Trump to repel nonwhite voters further. ?The voters who are young, who are people of color, and who are most sympathetic to the injustice of police shootings are more liberal, but inconsistent voters,? said a Michigan Democrat. ?This increased attention, if it has any impact, will boost their participation, and they are more likely to vote for Clinton.? Added a Florida Democrat: ?If Clinton can get black turnout as a share of electorate to Obama levels, in addition to her Hispanic advantages, she can lose a bit of white support and win.? But some Democrats worried about a backlash among white voters to the at-times-violent protests. ?Pictures of black youth burning things in the middle of Interstate 85 in Charlotte last night did nothing but help Trump,? said a North Carolina Democrat. ?With more demonstrations planned for tonight, this issue could even surpass the HB2 fiasco as the defining issue in the campaign for North Carolina voters.? Most Republicans see the issue as an opportunity for Trump to burnish his law-and-order credentials. ?People believe Obama has created an anti-police attitude in this country, and many will punish Hillary Clinton for that,? a Florida Republican said. And the demographic reality of the battleground states ? many of them, like Colorado, Iowa and New Hampshire have smaller African-American populations ? means a backlash among white voters in those states could tilt toward Trump. A Colorado Democrat said the African-American vote there was ?small and already locked in.? ?Iowa is 93 percent white, and [Black Lives Matter] protests are more galvanizing for downscale white voters than urban liberals,? said a Republican there. ?And those rural white voters outnumber urban liberals by a lot, many of them former working class Democrats who are attracted to nationalist, anti-PC rhetoric.? ?There are way more ?Blue Lives? than ?Black Lives? Matter folks in Iowa,? added another Republican there. ?Trump will clean up.? But some Republicans in more diverse states said the issue could motivate some members of the Obama coalition whohaven been enthusiastic about Clinton. ?[T]o the extent it may generate increased interest in public policy and the election in her base, that would be a good thing for her,? said a Virginia Republican. ?Hillary's base is there, but they aren't motivated or excited.? Added an Ohio Republican: ?Hillary has to ignite the black community. I expect the Obamas to camp out in the cities. This unrest could become a focal point for her.? And for other Republicans, they questioned Trump's ability to address these issues in a measured way. ""Trump is antagonistic and demeaning, and his ideology on racial issues/police shootings is embarrassing,"" said a Colorado Republican. A New Hampshire Republican put it even more sharply: ""No matter how hard he tries, Trump is incapable of hiding his racism."" But with the demographic push-and-pull between groups concerned in equal measure about the police shootings and the subsequent protests, others saw the issue as a wash between the two candidates. ?I think it helps them both equally,? said a Michigan Republican. ?Hillary needs minority turnout to go up, and this certainly helps there. Trump needs disaffected, law-and-order, white voters to turn out ? this helps him with that.?

During an appearance on the Netflix show ""Chelsea,"" Cuban said he even offered to play the role of Trump in Clinton's mock debates. Cuban said he emailed someone on the campaign but never heard back. He has emerged as a critic of Trump, questioning whether the New York real estate mogul is actually worth $10 billion, as Trump has claimed, and calling on the Republican presidential nominee to release his taxes. ?Whathe done well is put his name on big buildings. ...He good at that.

Mark Cuban (@mcuban) September 16, 2016 A Rare Moment of Peace When Trump announced he was running for president , Cuban viewed Trump as a promising candidate. Cuban called Trump ""probably the best thing to happen to politics in a long time"" in a statement last year on Cyber Dust, a private messaging app Cuban created. In September of last year, Cuban gave Trump the American Airlines Center in Dallas, where the Mavericks play, free of charge for one of his biggest rallies during the fall cycle. At that Sept. 14 rally last year, Trump called Cuban ""a great guy"" and thanked him for allowing him to use the arena. Back in May, during the veepstakes, Cuban said on ESPN Radio's ?Capital Games? podcast that he's ""wide open"" to being a running mate for either candidate. But the relationship between Trump and Cuban quickly soured. Cuban's 180-Degree Turn on Trump Cuban, in an interview with EXTRA June 21, unloaded on Trump: ""It?s rare that you see someone get stupider before your eyes, buthe really working at it. ...You have to give him credit.It a difficult thing to do, buthe accomplished it."" Cuban went on to explain the reasoning for his 180 on Trump. ?He sent me an email when I started picking on him. ? What happened was I reallydidn like Ted Cruz, so I started helping Donald, tried to encourage him, because I thoughthe be, and to this day thoughthe be a better candidate than Ted Cruz. ...

Cuban, 58, told CNN while campaigning with Clinton in his hometown of Pittsburgh on July 30, ""Donald initially ? I really hoped he would be something different, that as a businessperson, I thought there was an opportunity there. But then he went off the reservation and went bat---- crazy."" A History of Rivalry Cuban and Trump, 70, have been rivals for some time. Before the campaign kicked off, the two would get into frequent Twitter spats. Back in 2012, Cuban dared Trump to shave his head for charity, offering to pay $1 million if Trump went through with it.

In the background is a portrait of the late Yitzhak Rabin. | AP Photo Shimon Peres, Israeli leader for 8 decades, dies at 93 The Nobel Peace Prize winner was connected to every major event and figure in Israeli history. Shimon Peres, whose public career spanned the entire history of the state of Israel, reaching the highest of highs (the Oslo Accord) and the lowest of lows (the assassination of his close colleague Yitzhak Rabin) in the mid-1990s, has died. Peres, who suffered a stroke Sept. 13, was 93. The Jerusalem Post said he ""suffered severe organ failure Tuesday."" Story Continued Below Peres and Rabin shared a Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat ?for their efforts to create peace in the Middle East.? Their attempt, backed by President Bill Clinton, at solving the seemingly intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict was the biggest breakthrough in the region since the Israel-Egypt accords of 1978 and offered, for a time, hope for better days. Peres, who began his public life in Israel under founding Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, was twiceIsrael prime minister, in 1984-86 and 1995-96; he was also unofficially the prime minister in 1977. The 1995-96 stint had a tragic air to it ? it followedRabin slaying by an Israeli radical and was marked by Palestinian terrorism that, coupled with the assassination, halted momentum toward peace with the Palestinians. Connected to every major leader in Israeli history, Peres served in important government positions over eight decades, finally ending up in 2007 as president. He also had deep connections with the American Jewish community and U.S. political leaders. In 2012, President Barack Obama presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. ?No individual has done so much over so many years to build our alliance and to bring our two nations closer,? Obama said. Added Obama: ?Shimon Peres ? born in a shtetl in what was then Poland, who rose to become president of Israel ? he is a dreamer. And rightly so. For he knows what we must never forget: With faith in ourselves and courage in our hearts, no dream is too big, no vision is beyond our reach.? Peres was born Shimon Persky on Aug. 16, 1923, in Wiszniew, Poland (now part of Belarus). Among his relations: a Perske family in New York City that would yield Betty Jane Perske (born 1924), who achieved enduring fame as the actress Lauren Bacall. Under the sway of TheodorHerzl Zionist philosophy, his family emigrated to Palestine in 1934. ?To us,? Peres wrote in ""The Imaginary Voyage,"" his 2000 book about him, ?Herzl was an exceptional person, a kind of prince in exile or a king without a crown who had pointed out the route his people should follow.? In 1942, the remaining Jews in Peres? hometown, including his grandfather, were exterminated by the Nazis. Peres lived on a kibbutz and, in 1945, he married Sonia Gelman. In 1947, Peres joined the Haganah, which had been formed as a Zionist self-defense organization and was now at the forefront of Jewish efforts to prepare for the inevitable fight for statehood. The United Nations approved a resolution calling for the partition of Palestine into two states in November 1947, and Ben-Gurion proclaimedIsrael independence in May 1948. War followed, and Israel emerged from it a nation. Ben-Gurion appointed Peres director of naval services in 1948. ?David Ben-Gurion was a mythic figure, the founding father of Israel and a modern-day prophet, but he was also a real man who stormed through history on human legs,? wrote Peres in his 2011 biography of his mentor. ?It was my great privilege to know him and work with him for many years.? Peres served the young nation in just about every way imaginable, including a stint representing the Defense Ministry in the United States. He served in the Knesset (parliament) from 1959, and also as leader or deputy leader of Defense, Immigrant Absorption, Finance, Information, and Transport and Communication. A hawk on defense, Peres was known for his efforts to improve Israeli forces. In July 1976, he wasRabin defense minister when Israel launched a daring raid to rescue hostages held at Entebbe Airport in Uganda. Rabin was soon hit by a financial scandal, and Peres unofficially replaced him until elections could be held. In May 1977, Peres led the Labor coalition to its first-ever defeat, losing to MenachemBegin Likud Party. It was a setback that was to be repeated: For all his accomplishments, Perescouldn win overIsrael voters. ?He comes across,? wrote Marcus Eliason for The Associated Press in 1980, ?as a technocrat, as much at home with the silicon chip as with French literature. Technology fascinates him, be it the atomic bomb or the zip code.? After Begin defeated him again in 1981, Peres took onBegin successor, Yitzhak Shamir, in 1984. This time, neither coalition was able to secure a majority, so a unity government was formed, with Peres serving the first 25 months as prime minister and the next 25 asShamir vice premier/foreign minister. As prime minister, Peres withdrew Israeli forces from Lebanon and improved relations with Morocco and Egypt. As foreign minister in 1987, he negotiated a secret peace deal withJordan King Hussein that was designed to pave the way for Palestinian talks. That agreement was scuttled by Shamir, who then secured his hold on the primeminister job in 1988. In 1992, a revitalized Rabin was elected prime minister. Peres became his foreign minister, and secret talks with Palestinians began at an isolated farmhouse in Norway. The Associated Press later reported ?only 10 people in Israel knew that one of the MiddleEast most enduring taboos had been broken: Israel was talking to the PLO.? Shimon Peres is flanked by Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat as they hold their Nobel Peace medals and documents. | AP Photo A breakthrough came in August 1993, followed by a Sept. 13 ceremony on the White House lawn where Rabin and Arafat shook hands in front of Clinton. ?The signing of the Israel-PLO accord is more than a political milestone,? Peres wrote in Tikkun magazine. ?It is a transformative event which touches every Jewish family ? physically, emotionally, spiritually.? Some Jews feared the Oslo Accord would lead to the destruction of Israel; their objections were mirrored among those Arabs who adamantly rejectedIsrael right to exist. But things seemed to be on track as the deals were followed by further agreements, as well as a landmark treaty with Jordan. Then cameRabin assassination by radical Jewish right-winger Yigal Amir on Nov. 4, 1995, and Israeli society was turned upside down. According to the book ""Murder in the Name of God"" by Michael Karpin and Ina Friedman, Amir and his fellow plotters considered whether Peres should be killed along with Rabin. The decision, however, was made for Amir: As a giant peace rally in Tel Aviv ended, the two leaders left separately. Karpin and Friedman described the moment: ?As Yigal Amir sat on the concrete flower pot in the parking area, Shimon Peres descended the steps beside him. Amir noticed there was only one bodyguard with him and no policemen.Yigal arm moved to act, but he held back.Peres bodyguard cast a suspicious glance at him. ?ForGod sake,what that dark guy doing down there? Is he one of us?? the bodyguard whispered into his tiny microphone.? Shortly thereafter, Rabin exited and was gunned down by Amir. As Israel went into a period of mourning, debate and pained soul-searching, Peres became prime minister again. ?I shared with him days of worry and grief,? Peres said of Rabin in addressing a joint session of Congress in December 1995. ?I shared with him hours of reflection and decision. We complemented each other in a determined pursuit of the only objective worthy of the task bestowed upon us by the people of Israel: to carve a new era of security in peace, to build bridges across an Arab-Israeli divide, an impossible divide. And he, the captain, is no more.? Months later, Peres was ousted. He had confidently called for new elections, only to see his standing in the polls badly damaged by a rise in Palestinian terror attacks. Shimon Peres in June 1996, shortly after his loss to Benjamin Netanyahu. | AP Photo Buoyed by opposition to Oslo, Benjamin Netanyahu prevailed in elections in May 1996. As would-be peace partners, Netanyahu and Arafat were mismatched and distrustful. The promise of 1993 disintegrated. After the electoral rebuke, Peres remained onIsrael public stage. In 1996, he founded the Peres Center for Peace, an organization designed to promote peace withIsrael neighbors, as well as between Jews and Arabs within Israel. He served as president from 2007 until his retirement in July 2014. Even after his retirement, he remained an advocate for finding a peaceful solution. ""The alternative to two states is a continued war,"" he told The Associated Press in November 2015, ""and nobody can maintain a war forever. If you say we should live on our sword don't forget that there are other swords as well."" In August 2016, at the age of 93, he announced he had joined Snapchat. ""Today all the young people are on Snapchat, and I am happy to be there with them,"" Peres said in explaining that he always wanted to stay on the cutting edge of technology.

In 2008, Peres received an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II. In 2013, Clinton saluted him for his 90th birthday: ?You are theworld social Einstein. You have tried to put together a unified theory of meaning to unite politics and philosophy and psychology and history and science and technology. Every one of us who has been blessed enough to know you ? has been made a little bigger, a little stronger and a little more optimistic that one day your theory will be real,? he told Peres in Jerusalem, according to Haaretz. ?When I was a child, Israel was a legend more than a reality,? Peres said at that gala. ?She emerged from a dream, and today she has surpassed that dream.?

"Former Massachusetts governor and 1988 presidential candidate Michael Dukakis knows a little something about unpredictable election cycles and over-preparing for debates. Interested in Elections? Add Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest He spoke toABC Jonathan Karl and Rick Klein this week on the ?Powerhouse Politics? podcast and the topic of Hillary Clinton's extensive debate preparation came up. She has reportedly spent the past couple of weeks surrounded by advisers and briefing books, leaving the campaign trail in favor of mock debates. Dukakis advised the Clinton campaign to spend less time preparing for debates on topics she already knows well, because the real winner of the election would be, in his opinion, the campaign with the strongest field organization. ?This is not the first timeyou done this,? Dukakis said of Clinton, noting that most political debaters have had years of practice. ?And sure,it very important, but lots of other things are important in campaigns. Including your field organization and the people that are working for you.? He advised Clinton to focus more on dealing with Trump's unorthodox approach to debating. ""You've got to be spontaneous, feel spontaneous. It's going to be interesting to see how she deals with the Trump style,"" he said. In his own campaign 30 years ago, Dukakis, who was the longest-serving governor of Massachusetts, had a 17-percentage-point lead over Republican presidential nominee George H.W. Bush after the Democratic National Convention. By the second presidential debate, held at UCLA, he came off to voters as unfeeling when responding to a question about the death penalty and his wife. CNN's Bernard Shaw asked, ?Governor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?? When Dukakis responded instantly, ?No, Idon, Bernard. And I think you know thatI opposed the death penalty during all of my life,? reporters and voters were shocked. He cited the inefficacy of the death penalty, but the public saw his response as cold. He told Klein and Karl on ""Powerhouse Politics"" that he found the question fair, and didn't realize how he had done in the debates until someone else told him later. He cited his own over-preparation as the reason for this second debate flop. In this case, his logical and formulaic response did not prevail over the show of emotion that spectators were expecting. In the end,Clinton main challenge and focus should be on persuading voters to truly evaluate their opinion of Trump, he said. ?This guy has no business being president of the United States,"" he added.

"Newark  Former Port Authority executives and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie staffers planned to make the traffic from the September 2013 lane closures at the George Washington Bridge ""as bad as possible,"" according to testimony heard in federal court Monday. David Wildstein, former Port Authority director of Interstate Capital Projects, testified that in June 2013, Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, was upset that their office had not secured the endorsement of the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee New Jersey, Mark Sokolich, for Christie's reelection campaign. Wildstein, who has previously pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation, told Kelly that shutting down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge to put some political pressure on Sokolich was an option, according to his testimony. Wildstein is testifying as part of his plea deal. Sokolich testified last week that being a ""Democrat in a Democratic town"" put him in an uncomfortable position vis-a-vis a Christie endorsement, and he eventually declined because he did not want to ""alienate anyone."" On August 13, 2013, and as CNN has previously reported, Wildstein received an email from Kelly saying: ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee."" ""Got it,"" Wildstein responded. A phone call with Kelly the same day established the lane closures would go forward, it was revealed in testimony Monday. ""I did not question senior officials in the office of the governor,"" Wildstein said in court when asked if he questioned the decision. Wildstein became the de facto organizer of the eventual lane closures, and communicated every step of the way with Kelly and his then-boss, former Port Authority deputy executive director, Bill Baroni, according to his testimony. Wildstein and Kelly discussed and agreed that there would be no advance notice of the closures to Fort Lee officials or the public. They discussed how the Port Authority would respond to any inquiries, and agreed that all calls would be directed to Baroni's office and Baroni would not return the calls, testimony revealed. This ""radio silence"" policy was discussed with and approved by Baroni, Wildstein said. Wildstein testified that that lack of advance notice was to ""maximize the impact on Fort Lee."" Wildstein also recalled discussing the timing of the closures with Baroni and Kelly. Baroni asked when the first day of school in Fort Lee was, and when Wildstein told Baroni it was September 9, Baroni smiled and said, ""Fantastic,"" according to Wildstein's testimony. Kelly agreed on the September 9 date. Wildstein testified that his initial plan was to shut down all three Fort Lee access lanes, but after discussing the matter with Port Authority engineers who feared this could cause ""sideswipe crashes,"" Wildstein recommended to Baroni and Kelly that they shut down two lanes. On Friday, September 6, 2013, Wildstein informed several Port Authority staffers of the closures that were scheduled to begin on Monday, September 9. Bob Durando, Port Authority general manager of the George Washington Bridge expressed concern, telling Wildstein that the closures would cause a ""mess."" Wildstein told Durando the closures would be going forward, and to prepare accordingly. ""I told him not to say anything to anybody,"" Wildstein testified. Wildstein told Durando to direct any inquiries he gets during the closures to Baroni's office. Wildstein then informed former Port Authority chief engineer, Peter Zipf, of the closures, and asked Zipf to organize a way to get ""some numbers"" on the traffic patterns. Wildstein also informed Cedrick Fulton, Port Authority director of Tunnels, Bridges and Terminals. Fulton asked if Port Authority executive director, Patrick Foye, was aware. Wildstein testified that he told Fulton ""yes,"" but that this was a lie. All of these staffers were under the impression that the closures were part of a traffic study. On the day the closures began, Wildstein watched the traffic build up on screens inside a Port Authority administration building on the Fort Lee side of the George Washington Bridge. ""I knew the plan that I had set into motion was working,"" Wildstein testified. A Port Authority lieutenant also drove Wildstein around Fort Lee so Wildstein could see the traffic on the ground. Wildstein testified that he called Kelly that morning to tell her that traffic was building up, and ""she was pleased."" Several calls and emails began coming in to Baroni and Wildstein from Fort Lee officials, including the mayor, Sokolich, but their plan of ""radio silence"" was put into effect and no messages were returned. Last week, Wildstein testified that Baroni's role at the bi-state agency was essentially to be a representative of Christie's administration and that their top priority was to represent Christie's office's interests. Wildstein said he created a phrase that he and Baroni often used, ""the one constituent rule."" This referred to the fact that Governor Christie's opinion or good favor was the only one that mattered when it came to Port Authority affairs. Wildstein and Baroni used the ""one constituent rule"" as a barometer by which decisions would be made. Kelly and Baroni face conspiracy and fraud charges in connection with Bridgegate. Their attorneys have previously said they will both testify in their own defenses.",0.012345678999999998,0.00617284,0.00462963,0.018518519,0.061728395,0.20679012300000002,0.0,2,-1,1

""I wouldn't take up arms. That might be a little extreme,"" Clinton told Zach Galifianakis on Between Two Ferns, a mock interview show hosted by the comedian, when asked what she'd do if she lost the presidential election. Clinton added that if her quest for the White House were to fail she would stay in the country to try to prevent Donald Trump from ""destroying the United States."" Story Continued Below Some analysts credit the president's March 2014 appearance on Between Two Ferns with helping boost enrollment in Obamacare right when his administration needed it the most. And in an episode posted Thursday, Clinton decided to see if it could boost her campaign. Her team has admitted that is struggling to reach millennials, a demographic ripe for the show's humor. Joking about those who have questioned her judgment in recent days, Clinton said her appearance would probably prove her detractors right. As with Obama, Galifianakis left few topics untouched. He riffed onClinton time as secretary of state. ?How does Obama like his coffee?? he asked before questioning how many words per minute Clinton could muster. Galiafinakis also made light of Clinton's recent bout of pneumonia and questioned just how on earth she lost Scott Baio's vote to Donald Trump. ""You know, Zach, those are really out-of-date questions, you need to get out more,"" Clinton retorted when asked blatantly sexist questions. ""I could send you some pamphlets."" The 46-year-old comedian also snuck in a 1990s hip-hop reference on the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal, asking Clinton if she was ?down with TPP.? The Democratic nominee helped pave the way for the agreement as secretary of state, but now opposes it. But the sharpest moments came at the expense ofClinton opponent. Asked what tie Donald Trump might wear to the first presidential debate on Monday night, Clinton said probably a red power one. But when Galifianakis asked how a ?white power tie? would fit, Clinton joked that such a hue might be more appropriate. In another dig at Trump, Galifianakis said the show was sponsored by the New York businessman ? courtesy of the now discontinued Trump Steaks. Clinton said she would be ?afraid to eat them.?

"Hillary Clinton Out-Trumped Before Debate HillaryClinton worst nightmare has been realized. She will finally face Trump head to head in a debate. Before the debate has begun, Clinton has been out-trumped. Apparently Clinton will have billionaire Mark Cuban sitting in the front row of the debate. Some believe this move would intimidate Trump, though the two billionairesdon really have much of a past together. Cuban recently challenged Trump to a ?sit down? to discuss policy for 4 hours with no Clinton-bashing. If Trump accepted, Cuban agreed to donate $1 million to charity. Why Cuban has decided to jump in the presidential fray, since he is as significant in the discussion as navel lint. One might believe that with the ineffectiveness of HillaryClinton ?not so secret weapon,? Bill Clinton, that Cuban has become her surrogate. Other than ignore Cuban, if I were Trump, I would have donated $1 million to my own charity, then proclaimed victory over Cuban. My statement would be, ?Mark Cuban is a publicity seeker who needs me to be relevant.? As for Hillary Clinton bringing Cuban, this strategy will backfire. To some degree it already has, as inTrump response, Hillary Clinton has already been out-trumped. In response to the Cuban ?threat,? Trump secured Jennifer Flowers, long-time paramour ofHillary potential First Lady, Bill Clinton. As reported by the Washington Post: Gennifer Flowers, who revealed a sexual relationship with Bill Clinton in the 1990s, is saying she will attend Mondaynight debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton asTrump guest.Flowers assistant confirmed the decision toBuzzFeed Andrew Kaczynski Saturday afternoon, and Flowers herself told the New York Times in a text message, ?Yes, I will be there.? The decision was the latest play in a bizarre bit of gamesmanship between the Clinton and Trump campaigns over the debate.Clinton camp confirmed this week that it would invite billionaire mogul Mark Cuban, a Trump antagonist, to the debate. This move has already back-fired for Hillary Clinton, andhere why. First, Cuban is insignificant. It would be different if Trumphadn already marginalized Cuban. Cuban said Trumpwasn wealthy, then later retracted the statement after more careful examination ofTrump finances. Cuban is kooky. Surehe successful, but not as successful as Trump. Next, by bringing in Cuban, Hillary Clinton opened herself up for LOTS of damage. Trump has already responded by bringing in Jennifer Flowers, a move sure to open more moves. But this may be only the beginning. But Trump has many more ?mind-screws? he can do on Hillary and it can all happen before the debate. For example, Trump could invite Anita Broderick, and reference her when Hillary discusses the war on women. He could invite Linda Tripp, and have Linda appear with the infamous ?blue dress.? Or Trump could go for the jugular and invite Monica Lewinsky. Perhaps Trump could invite the families of the Benghazi victims, or a few Bernie or Bust supporters. Hillary Clinton has let the genie out of the bottle, and this genie is not her friend.

"House Republicans already struggling to protect their historic majority this fall are confronting a multimillion-dollar shortfall in their campaign budget ? driven partly by Freedom Caucus members and other hard-line conservatives who are boycotting theGOP campaign arm. A bloc of conservatives is refusing to transfer cash to the National Republican Congressional Committee, convinced the committee is favoring moderate candidates over hard-line conservatives. Dozens of other Republican lawmakers alsohaven paid their expected party ?dues,? including several in tough primaries or general election races who figure they need the money for themselves. Story Continued Below Several GOP sources told Politico that 3 in 10 members of the House Republican Conference are delinquent on their dues. And multiple senior Republicans said the shortfall exceeds $10 million. ?There?s a group of us who associate the NRCC with the establishment wing of the party,? said Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), who added that he has a ?principled objection to paying dues to the NRCC.? The Freedom Caucus member noted that a former top NRCC staffer helped outside groups unseat his friend, Rep. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, in a Republican primary last month, and said the committee is partly to blame. (The NRCCdoesn spend money in Republican primaries and says it has no control over outside groups.) Mulvaney also sayshe still upset by ads aired against him in early 2015 by American Action Network, a 501(c)(4) allied with then-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). The spots implored Mulvaney and other conservatives to end their blockade of a spending bill backed by leadership. After that, several other Freedom Caucus members stopped paying dues. ?There?s a groupthat still smarting from the fact some of our own went after us, andwe be damned ifwe going to put money back in their hands,? Mulvaney said. The dispute, which one chief of staff for a House Republican called a ?brewing war,? is another sign that the schism between the activist and establishment wings of the House GOP Conference has spread to the campaign trail. Over the summer, conservative- and establishment-aligned outside groups poured millions into primary showdowns between far-right and center-right candidates. Nowit continuing in the general election, as Republicans are struggling to head off double-digit seat losses with Donald Trump leading their ticket. The refusal by conservatives to pay has enraged some House Republicans, who say the NRCC and leadership have no control over outside groups. They also note that the NRCC helped many of the nonpaying members get elected in the first place. ?Politics is a team game and outside of the HFC, almost every member of the Republican Conference is busting his or her ass to raise money and get Republicans elected,? said one senior Republican. ?The HFC has chosen not to raise money or help get other Republicans elected, but for some reason they think they should control what the NRCC does or how it spends its money?That nuts.? While the NRCC has about $2.5 million more cash on hand than the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, House Democrats outraised Republicans by more than $11 million combined in July and August. A big chunk of the disparity is attributable to members not paying dues, several Republican sources said. The NRCC would not comment on the dues figures provided to Politico. It downplayed the conservative boycott, saying in a statement that ?we are always very grateful to our Conference for their commitment to ensuring we maintain and grow our historic Republican House majority.? But the problem appears to be serious enough that GOP leaders have pleaded with members several times in recent weeks to pony up. On a conference call with dozens of members the last week of August, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and NRCC Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) urged lawmakers to donate. Walden said Republicans were getting outraised by Democrats in both big and small donations, and Ryan said he was disappointed in members whohadn paid their dues, encouraging them to work as a team. And at a closed-door GOP conference meeting last week, Ryan and his top lieutenants told members they need to meet their assessments to close the fundraising gap with the Democrats. A PowerPoint presentation highlighted members who were current on dues and those whohadn paid, according to sources in the room. Multiple lawmakers and staffers also told Politico the NRCC is cracking down on members whohaven paid, even barring some from accessing committee resources or attending events until they do pay. One mid-August NRCC email to Republican chiefs of staff invited them to a reception on a rooftop terrace in downtown Washington, but only for ?chiefs of members who have completed their assessments.? The same goes with lawmakers: Country band Big & Rich headlinedNRCC second annual ?house party? last week at The Hamilton restaurant in D.C. But emails inviting lawmakers in early September noted that ?only members who are paid in full? on their dues can attend. Dues are based on ability to pay, factoring in amember committee assignments and seniority. Getting politicians to fork over their hard-raised cash is a recurring problem for the NRCC and DCCC. But the shortfall this year is especially pressing for Republicans ? and increasingly appears to be based on ideological rivalries. A former NRCC staffer defended the committee, saying ?many in the House Freedom Caucus would not be there if not for the NRCC.? The committee spent $1 million help elect Mulvaney in 2010, the person said, among other caucus memberswho benefited from thecommittee largesse. At the crux of the conservatives? boycott is a belief the NRCC is now supporting moderates who back theparty leadership against conservatives who push the party further to the right. ?When those folks are going against us ? would I support that with my money? No,? said Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.), a Freedom Caucus member who upset Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a primary two years ago. Some conservatives, including Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), have instead decided to transfer money to right-leaning candidates they personally support. If those contenders win the GOP primary, it could mean more influence for conservatives. Conservatives also suspect that leadership and the NRCC are behind outside establishment-aligned groups targeting the far right of the conference. When asked about NRCC dues, Brat saidit ?illogical for me to fund ads against myself? ? though the NRCC does not directly play in primaries. Many conservatives are still furious with AAN for the round of ads they ran in early 2015 ? though the Freedom Caucus did not take an official position on the matter. AAN told POLITICO they have spent multiple times the amount of money on positive ads for some for these same members since early 2015, including 10 times in Mulvaney's case. ?I?m not sure how you use issue advocacy ads run for one day 18 months ago as an excuse not to pay political dues,"" said Mike Shields, president of American Action Network. GOP leaders have told conservatives countless timesthey not trying to undercut them in campaigns, arguing they have no control over groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that might decide to target a conservative in a primary. Allies of leadership and the NRCC also note that one of the Freedom Caucus? strongest outside allies, the conservative Club for Growth, has actively gone after sitting lawmakers, including Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.). Others Republicans have been slow to contribute becausethey afraid for themselves. Several lawmakers or top staffers for lawmakerswho faced tough primaries said the NRCCdoesn help them whenthey challenged by fellow Republicans. ?They want you to give a lot of money, but it weakens you in defending yourself in the primary, and for us, the primary is where we live and die now,? said the chief of staff for one member who no longer pays his dues. In the meantime, top House Republicans are donating millions above their dues assessments to compensate for the shortfall. Ryan, for example, has transferred nearly $30 million alone. An altar call during lastTuesday GOP conference meeting, for example, brought more than $3 million, including $1.5 million from Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, $500,000 from House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling of Texas, $250,000 from Budget Chairman Tom Price of Georgia and $200,000 from Walden, sources in the room say. Leaders were hoping to inspire more transfers.It unclear so far whetherthey succeeded.",0.027640671000000002,0.003948667,0.006910168,0.009871668,0.044422507,0.255676209,0.0029614999999999997,2,-1,1

At least two of those approved are now being investigated by the FBI for links to terrorism, investigators said. But in most cases, Homeland Security and federal prosecutors have let the illegal immigrants-turned-citizens get away with their potential fraud. Charges were brought in just two of the more than 800 cases identified. One of the persons granted citizenship through the error-riddled process is now a law enforcement officer, and three others worked in security-sensitive fields ? including two who worked in sensitive areas at airports. ?USCIS granted U.S. citizenship to at least 858 individuals ordered deported or removed under another identity when, during the naturalization process, their digital fingerprint records were not in the DHS digital fingerprint repository,? the inspector general said. The 858 cases involved people from so-called ?special interest? countries, or from neighboring countries with major immigration fraud problems. Special interest countries are those places the government has identified as posing national security problems to the U.S.WHAT EVEN MORE UNBELIEVABLE: Investigators late last year identified another 953 cases that also seemed suspicious. The problem, according to the audit, is tens of thousands of illegal immigrants and criminal aliens whose files are so old that their fingerprints are still on paper cards. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that approves applications,wasn checking those paper-based files, so itdidn know the aliens were ineligible or had been ordered kicked out of the country already. The inspector general said some fingerprints have been digitized, but it identified 148,000 aliens who have been ordered deported but whose fingerprints are not in the IDENT system the department uses for its fingerprint checks.

"While the media is focused on the horserace that will help determine politics for the next eight years,they pretty much ignoring the fact that Washington is still in business and Republicans are busy being Republicans, which is to say that the rich will be getting richer while everyone else will be getting poorer. Ryan,who not sure he can back Donald Trump, likely because Trump dares say the things that Republicans generally say behind closed doors, has released a new domestic plan, called, ?A Better Way.? Ryan calls it his antidote to anger and division. The only problem is that if anyone pays attention to the plan, they will be angry at how he divides Americans into tax brackets, and as usual, the top tax brackets win. His plan includes a lot of Republican staples, like more military, less regulation, repealing Obamacare and deep cuts for poor people. In other words, same old cold-hearted Ayn Rand ?I got mine, now f*** you? GOP themes. Perhaps the worst part, though, is the tax plan. There are a lot of tax cuts (mostly at the cost to poor people) and nearly all of those ? 99.6 percent ? go to the top one percent. A typical Republican tax cut will give about 40 percent of its tax cuts to the richest one percent.Ryan plan, according to a new analysis by the Tax Policy Center, will give three-quarters of its tax cuts to the richest one percent in the first year. Andthat only because the cuts are slowly phased in. By 2025, the highest-earning one percent will enjoy 99.6 percent of the tax cuts. The remaining 0.4 percent will be divided up among the other 99 percent of the country. The new Paul Ryan tax cuts make the Bush tax cuts look like socialism.

"The Democratic president's diplomatic team, led by Secretary of State John Kerry, insists it will keep pursuing negotiations with the Russians. | Getty House Dems back Obama on Syria despite bloodshed The Obama administration's latest attempt to pacify Syria through diplomacy is failing in spectacularly bloody fashion, raising serious doubts among officials, analysts and others about whether pursuing more talks is worth it. But there's at least one prominent group urging the administration not to give up on negotiations. Story Continued Below As Syrian and Russian forces laid waste to the northern Syrian city of Aleppo on Tuesday, nearly 60 House Democrats sent a letter to President Barack Obama calling on him to ""persevere in this diplomatic path."" ""There is simply no realistic alternative to a diplomatic and political resolution of the Syrian civil war that takes into account the interests of Syria's diverse communities as well as the interests of all nations in a peaceful, stable Middle East,"" states the letter, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO. The missive appears to try to counteract a growing sense in some corners that if the United States is serious about stopping the fighting it must put some military muscle behind its pleas to Russia, the top international patron of Syrian President Bashar Assad. The lead signatories were Reps. John Conyers, Seth Moulton and Tim Walz, all miiltary veterans. More than 50 U.S. officials have already called on Obama to use military strikes to weaken Assad and protect Syrian civilians. But Obama has given no indication he's open to entangling the U.S. military in another Middle East war. The Syrian conflict has lasted more than five years, attracting an array of groups including terrorist networks, and estimates of the dead range up to half a million. The Democratic president's diplomatic team, led by Secretary of State John Kerry, insists it will keep pursuing negotiations with the Russians despite the collapse this month of a short-lived cease-fire and extraordinary acrimony between Washington and Moscow at the U.N. Security Council. Kerry pointed out to reporters Monday that although the U.S. and Russia are not talking ""right now"" ? presumably a reference to just a few days of silence ? Russia and Syria were attacking rebel-held areas in Aleppo anyway. As a result, Kerry is unwilling to give Moscow and Damascus a permanent cold shoulder. ""We're still focused on a political solution,"" said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman. Kerry's diplomatic dependency has led to grumbling by Republicans. Just last week, GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, called Kerry ""intrepid but delusional."" Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), who respectively chair the Senate and House foreign affairs committees, have raised doubts about the reliability of the Russians or the Syrians when it comes to talks. Corker said Friday he was ?saddened for the people of Syria who are being murdered"" but that ""this was always to be the outcome of negotiations since Russia has known all along that there was nothing to back up empty words from the United States.? There are no notable GOP calls for the administration to send combat troops to Syria, but Royce and others have pushed Obama to impose sanctions on Russia for its aid to the Syrian dictator. ""There is no hope for diplomacy as long as Assad sees a military path to victory,"" Royce said in a statement to POLITICO on Tuesday. ""Imposing stiff sanctions onAssad war machine and its enablers will allow us to push for peace from a position of strength."" The House Democrats' letter came about with support from left-leaning groups including the Friends Committee on National Legislation, a Quaker organization, and Just Foreign Policy. The letter writers urge Obama to think beyond Syria when it comes to diplomacy, suggesting he look for peaceful ways to end the war in Yemen and to resolve the conflict between the Turkish government and Kurdish separatists.",0.033402923,0.004175365,0.010438413,0.008350731,0.043841335999999995,0.248434238,0.002087683,2,-1,1
"Story highlights More than 1,800 individuals who were naturalized should have been deported from the country DHS said it would review all 1,811 individuals ""out of an abundance of caution"" Washington (CNN) The number of individuals who were supposed to have been deported but were instead granted citizenship is far higher than was initially reported by media covering the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General's office report on the matter. On Monday, the Inspector General reported that 858 individuals from ""special interest countries"" -- meaning countries that are considered to be ""of concern to the national security"" of the US -- were supposed to have been deported but were instead granted US citizenship. But the truth is the report is even worse than reported, with more than 1,800 individuals naturalized who should have been deported from the country. A reason for the underplaying of the number may have been the report's focus, which was whether the US Citizenship and Immigration Services was using digital fingerprints effectively. The Inspector General determined that the agency granted citizenship to 858 individuals who had been ordered deported or removed under another identity but ""their digital fingerprint records were not available"" during the naturalization process. But a footnote on page one of the report also states that there were, as of November 2015, an additional 953 individuals about whom the Inspector General couldn't determine if there was a problem with the fingerprint records specifically, but also should have been deported. This other group consisted of members of a slightly broader classification, from countries of concern as well as from neighboring countries where there is a history of fraud.

"Trump said his plan to cut the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent would ?be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.? | Getty Trump's economic pitch misses the strike zone He was at his best in knocking trade deals, but Clinton threw him off balance with attack on his tax plan. Donald Trump enjoyed his strongest moments of the first presidential debate railing about trade deals crushing manufacturing jobs and then ripping the slowest economic recovery since World War II. But when it came to his specific plans to make things better, Trump came up short and ran into a details-obsessed opponent who shredded the GOPnominee tax plan as a retread of tax cuts for the rich that would explode the deficit. Story Continued Below Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton even had a catchphrase handy to parryTrump promises of a rocket-fueled economy: ?trumped-up trickle-down.? IfTrump goal on Monday was to put some serious meat behind his promises to ignite a sluggish economy and put Clinton squarely on the defensive on the issue, he succeeded only sporadically. Trump wasted no time in the high-decibel debate in blaming bad trade policies for a hollowing out of the American economy. ?Our jobs are fleeing the country. They are going to Mexico, they are going to many other countries,? Trump said at the start. ?We have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and with it, firing all of their people.? Trump said his plan to cut the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent would ?be a job creator like wehaven seen since Ronald Reagan.? These kinds of appeals have helped Trump draw nearly even in the presidential race and ahead in swing states such as Ohio that have suffered the loss of well-paying manufacturing jobs that do not require advanced training. But when it came to laying out specifics for how he would create a renaissance in American manufacturing, Trump ran onto rougher ground. Pressed by moderator Lester Holt for details on how he would get jobs back, Trump muddled through a digression on China devaluing its currency (it has actually been appreciating) and saying we have to ?stop them from leaving.? Exactly how was unclear beyond the imposition of large import taxes that many economists believe would spark damaging and possibly recession-inducing trade wars. Clinton responded in part by agreeing with Trump that trade deals should be better, ceding the offensive to the Republican nominee at the start. But she quickly pivoted to a simple message: The economy is much better than it was when President Barack Obama took over in 2009, and slashing taxes for top earners is not the best way to fixwhat currently broken. ?I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of theworld population. We have to trade with the other 95 percent. And we need to have smart, fair trade deals,? she said before launching into her first prepared zinger of the night. ?The kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country, thatwe ever had. I call it trumped-up trickle-down, becausethat exactly what it would be.? This was one ofClinton top agenda items for the night: Cut offTrump rise with voters frustrated by the grinding nature of the U.S. economy and hungry for some kind of change of course, even ifit delivered to them by an unconventional candidate theydon really think is prepared for the presidency. Polls consistently show Americans view the country as on the wrong track and the economy as either stuck in the mud or getting worse. A POLITICO-Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health poll out this week showed that 56 percent of Americans believe the economy has stayed the same or gotten worse since the 2008 meltdown. The facts do not really support this, with unemployment down to 4.9 percent and incomes finally starting to rise significantly for middle-income earners. But many people stilldon perceive the economy as improving, something Clinton also tried to address Monday night, while also taking the opportunity to needle Trump on his business record. ?Let?s stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s,? she said. ?That was in large part because of tax policies that slash taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street and created a perfect storm. In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said back in 2006, gee, I hope it does collapse because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.? Trump did not even try to rebut this assessment, just as he did not deny paying little or no federal income taxes for years. ?That?s called business,? he said about profiting from the housing market collapse. Clintondidn let up, diving again into her bag of statistics to ripTrump tax plan by citing studies showingTrump proposed corporate and individual cuts would ?blow up the debt by over $5 trillion? and cost more than 3 million jobs. Trump also did not have much of a response for this attack, pivoting instead to the increase in the debt duringObama term and then simply stating: ?I will bring back jobs. Youcan bring back jobs.? Clinton tossed in a favorable reference to the 1990s economy under President Bill Clinton, which saw 20 million new jobs created, and rejectedTrump notion that Clinton signing the North American Free Trade Agreement was a disaster for the U.S. ?I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again,? she said. ?Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing went up in the 1990s, ifwe actually going to look at the facts.? And on it went from there, Trump offering bold promises and generalizations but looking very thin on how he might deliver them. The Clintoncampaign hope with these debates is that the remaining pool of undecided voters tempted by the thought of a major course change will look atTrump lack of specifics ? andClinton command of data and detail ? and decideit not worth taking the risk. Clinton also had a zinger waiting for Trump when he ripped into her over her initial praise for the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement. ?You called it the gold standard. You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You saidit the finest dealyou ever seen,? he said. ?And then you heard what I said about it and all of a sudden you were against it.?It a potentially powerful argument for Trump in the Rust Belt. But Clinton was ready. ?Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts,? she said. ?The facts are ? I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated, which I was not responsible for, I concluded itwasn. I wrote about that in my book before you even announced.?",0.030229746000000002,0.004836759,0.004836759,0.015719468,0.045949214,0.32889963699999997,0.00120919,2,-1,1

"Washington  Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump for the presidency Friday afternoon, a stunning turn of events after a contentious primary filled with nasty personal attacks and a dramatic snub at the Republican National Convention. ""After many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump,"" Cruz wrote in a Facebook post ""A year ago, I pledged to endorse the Republican nominee, and I am honoring that commitment. And if you don't want to see a Hillary Clinton presidency, I encourage you to vote for him."" ""I am greatly honored by the endorsement of Senator Cruz,"" Trump said in a statement obtained by CNN. ""We have fought the battle and he was a tough and brilliant opponent. I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again."" The move -- three days before Trump's critical first debate with Clinton -- comes as the Trump and Cruz camps have moved closer in recent weeks. Trump's vice presidential nominee Mike Pence played a key role in bringing Cruz into the fold. Pence and Cruz traded multiple messages, then spoke at length once on the phone and again in person, when Pence visited Capitol Hill a few weeks ago, a source close to Pence said. Trump has hired key Cruz allies such as Kellyanne Conway as his campaign manager, and Jason Miller as a spokesman. Wednesday, Trump's campaign expressed support for a Cruz-backed, Internet-related proposal in government funding talks in the Senate. Friday, Trump released a new list of conservative judges likely to appeal to the former Supreme Court clerk -- including perhaps Cruz's closest friend in Congress, Utah Sen. Mike Lee. Cruz cited Trump's pledges on the judiciary in his Facebook post. ""We know, without a doubt, that every Clinton appointee would be a left-wing ideologue. Trump, in contrast, has promised to appoint justices 'in the mold of (the late Antonin) Scalia,' Cruz wrote. ""For some time, I have been seeking greater specificity on this issue, and today the Trump campaign provided that, releasing a very strong list of potential Supreme Court nominees ? including Sen. Mike Lee, who would make an extraordinary justice ? and making an explicit commitment to nominate only from that list."" A Cruz endorsement could be the last pillar to helping Trump shore up the support of conservatives who have remained reticent about supporting his campaign. Trump has already gotten most Republicans and conservatives on board with his campaign -- largely by reassuring them on the Supreme Court and on issues like the Second Amendment and abortion. But Cruz's principled opposition to offering his support has given some conservatives high-profile cover. Just as Cruz's refusal to endorse Trump at the RNC fueled Democrats' efforts to paint Trump as divisive even within his own party, Cruz's endorsement will help undermine that narrative -- suggesting to conservatives unsure about Trump that perhaps the brash billionaire has changed, and can be trusted to bring conservative change to Washington. 'Lyin' Ted' and 'utterly amoral' The move marks a dramatic turnaround from the personal insults Cruz and Trump traded during the previous year. The two men clashed repeatedly during the primaries, as Trump taunted the senator with the nickname ""Lyin' Ted,"" suggested Cruz wasn't eligible to be president due to his Canadian birthplace, and even speculated that Cruz's father was involved in the JFK assassination. Trump also said Cruz should ""be careful"" or he would "" spill the beans on your wife ,"" and retweeted an unflattering picture of Heidi Cruz. Those tweets have not been deleted from Trump's account. Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife! ? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2016 On his last day of the GOP campaign -- the Indiana primary in early May -- Cruz let loose against Trump , calling the businessman a ""serial philanderer,"" ""utterly amoral,"" and ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen. At the RNC in Cleveland, Cruz gave a memorable speech espousing conservative values but ended without endorsing Trump, as Trump allies booed from the convention floor. ""Don't stay home in November,"" Cruz said. ""Stand and speak and vote your conscience."" The next day, he defended the move by citing Trump's attacks against his family. ""I'm not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,"" Cruz told members of the Texas delegation . ""That pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander and attack Heidi that I'm going to nonetheless come as a servile puppy dog and say, 'Thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.'"" After the convention, Trump said that he would not accept Cruz's endorsement if he offered it. ""I don't want his endorsement. If he gives it, I will not accept it, just so you understand. If he gives it I will -- I will not accept. It won't matter. Honestly he should've done it because nobody cares and he would've been in better shape for four years from now,"" Trump said. Facing Senate primary in 2018? Cruz's move may also be politically expedient. He faces a possible 2018 Senate primary challenge from Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, who has increasingly made an issue of Cruz's failure to endorse Trump. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has said Republicans who don't back Trump could pay a price down the road. And Trump also floated the idea of setting up a super PAC to oppose Cruz if he decided to run for office again. Clinton's campaign, after Cruz's message posted on Facebook, was happy to note a number of shots Cruz took at Trump during the primary, including when he called on the businessman to release his tax returns. Clinton's official twitter account retweeted a tweet Cruz sent during the primary that said, ""I've released 9 years of tax returns. RT if you agree it's time for Donald Trump to release his!"" I've released 9 years of tax returns. RT if you agree it's time for Donald Trump to release his! https://t.co/08whtFVC0r ? Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) April 19, 2016 Clinton's campaign has been hounding Trump to release his taxes, arguing that he isn't doing so because they show shady business deals and ties to Russia. Trump has said he would release his taxes after an IRS audit. Clinton's vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine, campaigning in Austin, Texas, Friday, said he couldn't support someone who used the same language Trump did about Cruz's father. ""I just can't help but say this,"" Kaine said. ""Donald Trump suggested that Ted Cruz's dad was involved in the JFK assassination. Now we know that that is false, but false isn't, there's not the right word to describe what that is. It is so outrageously false. And as far as I know Donald Trump has not retracted it. As far as I know he has not apologized for it. And so if somebody said that about my dad they would never have me as a supporter for anything."" Radio host Steve Deace tweeted his disappointment, calling the move a mistake and speculating that Cruz backers may not all follow the senator. ""I think it's the worst political miscalculation of my lifetime. I hope I am wrong.

Until you flip on the news one day and figure out that they were DEAD wrong. Terrorist suspect Ahmad KhanRahami father, Mohammad Rahami, went to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in August of 2014 with serious concerns about his son.

"U.S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe could face disciplinary action if she continues to kneel during the national anthem before games. Despite an official statement from U.S. Soccer stating that both coaches and players are expected to stand at attention during the national anthem, Rapinoe continued to kneel at the Sept. 18 game against the Netherlands, protesting what she believes to be injustice and oppression in the United States. Rapinoe first began her protest in solidarity with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who announced that he will not stand for the anthem as long as there is continued police brutality and racial prejudice in this country. His statements and actions have created a national movement, with athletes like Rapinoe following in his footsteps.

The author works for David Axelrod. Chicago (CNN) The Republican Party of 2016 has strayed so far from its principles that even Ronald Reagan would be unable to navigate his way through its thorny politics, according to Michael Steele, who was Republican National Committee chairman from 2009 to 2011 and is now a political analyst for MSNBC. Episode embed code: ""Ronald Reagan, if he were a candidate running for any office today, would not win a Republican primary,"" Steele said to David Axelrod on ""The Axe Files"" podcast, produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN. ""Because the things that he would espouse, the policies, the values, the principles that he would lay out there, would be rejected,"" Steele said, before describing Reagan's position on taxes and immigration that would now be viewed as anathema to many Republicans. Instead of speaking to issues that have a real impact on people's lives, Steele sees a Republican Party that's grappling with a nominee who uses his national platform to focus on ""nonsensical"" issues like President Barack Obama's birth certificate, a matter that Steele bluntly called ""bullshit racism."" Michael Steele as RNC Chairman in 2012 Whether Donald Trump wins or loses in November, Steele predicts that the tensions within the party will go unresolved. ""The Trump supporters will say, 'You didn't support him, that's why we lost.' That's a fight. The corporate class will say, 'God, why did we nominate him? That's why we lost.' (Capitol) Hill and the political class will say the same. The activists will be further dismayed and frustrated."" But Steele doesn't see this problem as being unique to Republicans. He views Bernie Sanders's candidacy as a manifestation of a similar tension between establishment figures and a progressive faction that wants to pull the party further to the left.

"Bill Clinton shared a series of anecdotes detailing the good work it has done both in the U.S. and abroad Wednesday. | Getty Bill Clinton on CGI legacy: 'You have to keep this alive' The former president defends the Clinton Global Initiative's work and urges supporters to carry on its mission. Bill Clintondoesn want his life's work to fade quietly into the night. In a personal speech defending his legacy at the Clinton Global Initiative ? from its humble roots in his Harlem office to the international, star-studded conference it has become ? the former president pleaded with the crowd Wednesday evening that the work couldn't end. ?You have to keep this alive,? he said. Story Continued Below But in its current version, Clinton's organization is dying. The former president's speech marked the official end of CGI, a glitzy, 12-year-old conference that convened Fortune 500 CEOs, movie stars, world leaders and nonprofit do-gooders in New York City during the United Nations meeting. There, they forged partnerships and made commitments to collaborate on projects such as saving elephants, improving AIDS relief in Africa and fighting forwomen rights across the globe. But with political pressure mounting as Election Day draws closer, the former president announced last month that the Clinton Foundation would stop accepting foreign and corporate donations if Hillary Clinton is elected president and that the annual CGI conference would cease its operations regardless of the outcome Nov. 8. In what aides billed as a swan song for the Big Dog, Clinton touted his organization as ?a profound advance in the conduct and impact of modern philanthropy.? Clinton, allies said, has been frustrated that the work he has devoted more than a decade of his life to has become what he thinks is a smearedpolitical target in the 2016 race. The initiative and its parent organization, the Clinton Foundation, have been the target of regular attacks from Republicans on the campaign trail, who allege that Hillary Clinton offered special treatment as secretary of state to individuals and nations who donated to thefamily charity. A series of emails from longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin obtained by the conservative group Judicial Watch through a Freedom of Information Act request appeared to show increased access to the former secretary of state and other power brokers for Clinton Foundation donors ? a suggestion that the Democraticnominee campaign has unequivocally denied. The former president saw the final CGI meeting that concluded Wednesday evening as his best opportunity to change the narrative and explain himself. In a speech he was writing himself until the last minute, Clinton detailed the work CGI has done both in the U.S. and abroad, defending his post-presidential legacy to date. The partners that worked together, he said, were ?united only by a common mind-set, the belief that everyone has something to give and the obligation to give it, the belief that our actions really can make a difference and that as 21st century citizens, we all have a moral obligation to at least get caught trying to do that.? The former president, who was introduced by his daughter, said theinitiative beginnings are rooted in Harlem, where Bill Clinton first set out simply to be a good neighbor and help the businesses surrounding his post-administration office. He reminisced about raising money to rebuild rural parts of India after an earthquake and raising money for college for children of victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Overall, CGI has helped 435 million people in 180 countries, Clinton said. ?You are living proof that good people committed to creative cooperation have almost unlimited positive impact to help people today and give our kids better tomorrows,? he said. ?I have spent the past 15 years of my life trying to advance that idea.? ?This is all that does work in the modern world. People may tell youyou making incremental change,? he added. ?But look back after 11 years and see what the aggregate is.There nothing incremental about helping 435 million people in 180 countries.? He made no explicit mention of hiswife campaign or her opponent, Donald Trump, but his message dovetailed with what the Democratic nominee was saying on the stump in Orlando: that ?love trumps hate.? ?You have to cultivate a culture of possibility,? Bill Clinton said. ?You have to know we can do more together than apart.?",0.031311155,0.003913894,0.005870841,0.01369863,0.048923679000000005,0.272015656,0.009784736,2,-1,1

"HillaryClinton campaign is making one plea ahead of Mondaynight big debate:Don let Donald Trump get away with it. AndTrump campaign is firing right back, arguing that the press is biased against the Republican nominee and, in any case,Clinton team is just trying to ?game the refs.? Story Continued Below The debate is playing out against a backdrop of polls that indicate a tightening White House race, with Trump drawing even or ahead in national and battleground-state surveys. Polling averages now show thatClinton post-convention lead has evaporated, and no less a guru than Nate Silver declared on Monday morning that the race is a ?dead heat.? ?The latest polling is consistent with a Clinton lead of only ~1% nationally. State firewall breaking up. Trend lines awful,? Silver tweeted. During the critical hours of expectation-setting ahead of the 9 p.m. showdown at Hofstra University, both camps claimed their candidate would be held to an unfair standard, withClinton aides explicitly requesting that moderator Lester Holt fact-check Trump in real time. ?We are concerned that Donald Trump may lie, he may throw misinformation out there, and that Hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish,? Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told ?CBS This Morning,? adding that all the campaign is asking of Holt is that if Trump lies, ?that that simply be checked.? ?The thing that concerns us is not the moderator themselves, who have been selected by the commission, because they will be seen as fair and even-handed. What bothers us, Mark, is the very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs,"" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway shot back in an interview on MSNBC. But Conway was soon put in the awkward position of defendingTrump claim that Holt may be unfair to him becausehe a Democrat and the system is ?very unfair.? The ?NBC Nightly News? anchor has been a registered Republican in New York since 2003. ?Idon know that he knew what LesterHolt voter registration was,? said Conway, who went on to dodge multiple queries of why Trump lied. ?Hedidn lie,? Conway said at one point, explaining that ?a lie would mean that he knew theman party registration.? In a presidential cyclethat seen endless debates about debates,Monday theme was conflicting interpretations of what it means to be a moderator. After suggesting a debate with no moderator, Trump has already signaled to Holt that heshouldn try to be Candy Crowley, who famously injected herself into the 2012 presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney with a fact-check of the GOP nominee. ButClinton campaign has beat up onHolt NBC colleague Matt Lauer, who was widely panned in the media for allowingTrump false assertion that hedidn support the Iraq war go unchecked during a national security forum earlier this month. The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which selected the debate sites and moderators, weighed in Sunday. ?In our history, the moderators have found it appropriate to let the candidates be the ones that talk about the accuracy or the fairness of what the other candidate or candidates might have said,? Janet Brown, thecommission executive director, toldCNN ?Reliable Sources.? When it comes to fact-checking, Brown warned, ?Idon thinkit a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.? For her part, Clintonwon letTrump lies ?go by the wayside,? press secretary Brian Fallon told CNN on Monday, insisting that Holtshouldn, either. ?There is enough lies that Donald Trump tells consistently that everyone, by now, should be able to call them out,? he said. ?Lester Holt, Hillary Clinton will, too, but I think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching that are grading the two candidates? performances should take it into account. By now, we all know he likes to lie about his record when it comes to the Iraq war, he lies about his support for the intervention in Libya, he lies about who started birtherism, he lies on any different number of issues and he tells them so frequently that we all know them now. If he says them again, that should be disqualifying. Hecan possibly be given a passing grade if he repeats those lies.? Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a paid CNN contributor who is still receiving severance from the Trump campaign, dismissed the idea that a fact-checking moderator is of any concern. ?I think what the concern is from both of the campaigns ? and what it should be ? is that the moderator is not the personwho running for president of the United States. So I think you let the candidates debate, you let the candidates answer,? he said. ?You can hold people accountable,there no question, but Idon thinkit the role of the moderator to inject themselves in sothey making themselves part of the debate structure and people are talking about the moderator after the debate.?Trump campaign, including his former aide Lewandowski, also pushed the narrative that Clinton is robotic. That charge was leveled in response to the Clintoncamp preparation for two Trumps. ?Wedon want DonaldTrump lies and distortions to be a distraction.We hoping that can get checked so that Hillary can focus her time on what she wants to do,? Mook toldNBC ?Today.? Asked aboutClinton rules of engagement versus Trump, Mook added that ?it just depends on what Donald Trump shows up to the debate, and we justdon know that.? But Conway shot down the notion thatthere any other Trump, while echoing the criticism that the former secretary of state lacks human compassion. Lewandowski cast Clinton as a policy wonk whose challenge is ?to become human? during the debate, senior communications adviser Jason Miller tweeted that ?Overprogramming leads to short circuits,? and Conway joined the pile-on. ?He?s not going to be robotic and scripted. Hillary Clinton is,? Conway said. ?Andthat a problem in debates likes this because people want to see a future commander in chief and president of the United States who is nimble and resilient and can answer questions thathaven been pre-programmed in their head through all this secretive debate prep and mock debates.? After Mook warned against ?a double standard where Donald Trump can get the Most Improved award but Hillary Clinton, you know, is getting judged on the fine points of policy,? Conway added that the two campaign managers ?are living in parallel universes.? ?I mean, Donald Trump has been criticized all weekend long. I think that the Clinton campaign has clearly been gaming the refs, has been talking to the media for a week now sayingit your job to make sure that Donald Trump is fact-checked in real-time,? she said. ?I'm just surprised a campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate. But look, they know that campaign debates are not Hillary Clinton's sweet spot. Yes, she's experienced at doing them, but the experiencehasn necessarily been beneficial.? Aside from how Holt will moderate, Conway cited pre-written narratives and what she claimed wasClinton willingness to say anything to get elected as her top concerns. ?I?m worried that some of the headlines are already written, thatthey conclusions in search of evidence,? Conway said, adding that newspapers and reporters have already begun trying to undercut Trump ahead of the debate. ?What I would ask you all to do is start looking at the Twitter feeds of, quote, objective reporters, particularly our embeds. These are not profiles in courage, and this is not journalism. There are people who cover our campaign who actually just slander our candidate on Twitter,? Conway said. ?Ninety-two percent of at least two of our embeds? tweets are negative towards Donald Trump. Why are they on our campaign plane? Why are they covering our campaign? ... Excuse the Trump campaign if we feel like wecan get a fair shake from certain people.? Conway also indicated that Clinton may play the woman card, skewing headlines that take away from the real estatemogul performance. ?So if she ends up saying to him, ?That?s just not true,you distorting my record,you being mean to a woman,? and then people will say, ?He was mean to a woman,? and the headlines will scream and Twitter will blow up ? even ifit not true,? she said. ?So that would be my concern, thathe not able to get out all of his responses because, as Joe [Scarborough] correctly points out, people are so worried thatshe not a great debater, thatshe not really ready for tonight the way he is, thatshe going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such a way that he was somehow rude to a woman and he somehow lied on the stage.? Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and a prominent Trump surrogate, said he had advised Trump to ""just let loose"" and be himself ? and not try to compete with Clinton's detailed policy expertise. ""She's been in government since I was a child. I don't remember a time she hasn't been in government in one way or another,"" Giuliani said on ""Fox and Friends."" ""So she's going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has, but I think he's going to comport himself very, very well, and he's going to be ? he's just going to be like you see him on ? when he comes here [on Fox News] and when you talk to him on the phone. He's going to be Donald Trump.""",0.039497307,0.010771993,0.008976661,0.014362657,0.070017953,0.27378815100000004,0.0017953320000000002,2,-1,1
"Getty Images Wealth Of Nations Trump vs. Clinton: A Fundamental Clash over How the Economy Works He sees it as zero-sum. She believes all boats rise together. Hillary is right, but a lot of people are buying intoTrump vision. As he made clear once again in Mondaynight debate, Donald Trump sees the world in zero-sumterms one person or one country wins, another always loses. Asked byNBC Lester Holt how to help American workers, Trump responded in his usual way, saying America was getting beaten by everyone else around the world, and the NAFTA free-trade deal was ?one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. ... We have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.? Hillary Clinton, by contrast, sees the world as a place where all boats can rise atonce she also made plain Monday by harking back to BillClinton pro-globalization presidency, which included NAFTA. ?I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again,? she said. ?Incomes went up for everybody.? Story Continued Below That is the election of 2016 distilled down to its essence. ?My whole life is about winning. ? I always win,? Trump says in explaining whyhe running. The economic plan on his website begins with the rubric ?Winning the Global Competition.? Youdon get more zero-sum than that. Despite the view of most economists that the economy overall is not a zero-sumgame rather a complex mechanism that, if run right, can raiseeveryone welfare atonce?s message has resonated in an era whenit become common to speak of winners and losers in the global economy. The zero-sum message fits neatly with the widespread reality that many millions have been severely harmed by the transitions in our economy over the past decades. As Danny Vinik recently noted in Politico, the gap between those who are thriving in the new economies of today and those who are not continues to grow. The recent Census Report that showed a 5.2 percent increase in real median income between 2014 and 2015 was taken by many as proof that the narrative of an America in decline and losing is fundamentally flawed. Statistically, if the United States is one unit, that is true. But 320 million people have a huge variety of experiences ill-suited to one size fit all numbers, and while the averages and medians may go up or down, that says nothing about the lived experience of tens of millions who diverge from that one number. And the experience of a goodly portion of what was the industrial heartland and what was the epicenter of the mid-2000s housing bubble is unequivocally negative, insecure and economically grim. Hence, you have the sense that those who perceive themselves as winners in the global economy are trending towards the Democrats, while those who thinkthey lost are going toward Trump. There is some truth there, but thatisn a sufficient explanation for why, for instance, massive percentages of African-Americans and Latinos, who have certainly struggled economically and socially, support Clinton. No, what is most striking about this election is the degree to which the electorate is polarized not between winners and losers per se but between those who view the world in such zero-sum terms, like Trump, and those who sense that it is possible to multiply the numbers of winnerswithout creating a commensurate number of losers. That has been the mantra of Clinton and her predecessors in the Democratic Party, and it was also the foundation of RonaldReagan appeal. The belief that the economic pie can expand year after year and embrace ever more people has also backed up by a generation of economists who argue that open trade and globalization makes the whole world wealthier. Hillary Clinton has continued to deliver that message. At the Democratic Convention in July she spoke of an America thriving with economic opportunity, with millions working hard and succeeding. President Obama has also been at pains to highlight the innovations of Silicon Valley, the revival of many cities in the past decade, and the substantial gains on the other side of 2008-2009 financial crisis. Judging from polls and surveys, those who fit that description ? clustered and concentrated in large metro areas, and on the coasts especially ? support Clinton and the Democrats by wide margins. *** Is either side right? Most economists see the liberal internationalist order backed by the law establishing the rules of engagement in free markets as a key element to the emergence of a several billion-strong global middle class. In general, that view is correct. But it still tends to gloss over just how wrenching it is to be among the tens of millions in the United States caught in the vortex of rapid change. It does these global laggards no good to say that they have bigger homes and longer lives and more possessions than their grandparents. They legitimately fear that they will lose those homes, be unable to afford healthcare, that they will see their communities crumble and theirchildren hopes extinguished. And they see a world of others who appear to be doing better, who seem to be winning, and a political establishment that has promised everything and delivered what feels like nothing. The voice of the so-called losers in this global competition is as loud, politically speaking, asit been in a long time. Hence Trump (not to mention Bernie Sanders? powerful insurgency in the Democratic primaries). The last time so many in the United States were so sour about the inequities between those winning (the few) and those losing was at the dawn of the Progressive Movement in the 1890s. Many early Progressives rebelled against an elite vision of Social Darwinism then prevalent which said that the strong and the best thrive while the rest manage to eke out what they can. In 1896, the scion of that view was William Jennings Bryan, who painted a picture of the United States every bit as bleak and dark as Trump with his thundering about elites on the coasts crucifying hard worker labor and farmers on a ?cross of gold.? Bryan lost two elections, and his zero-sum view never came to dominate American politics. Much of his message about inequality and the need to reform the system, however, was taken up by Theodore Roosevelt and generations of both Republicans and Democrats. Some of it harsh and redistributive, focused on trust busting and exerting American influence and prestige abroad, and much of it was about expanding opportunities for all. Trump also enjoys a good deal of sub-rosa support among business leaders and Wall Street, who certainlyhaven lack for economic benefits intoday world. Theyaren supporting him with their money, but many of them detest Clinton and see Trump as expressing their world view. For Wall Street, that makes some sense, in that in the wake of the financial crisis, key aspects of finance are becoming less popular and less profitable. In that sense, finance, which was the winning sector of the economy from the mid-1980s through the mid-2000s, has been losing ground. The idea of gain and loss, and that every trade represents a winner and a loser, is deeply embedded in aspects of Wall Street. We have, of course, no idea which candidate and which worldview will prevail in six weeks. But if Trump wins, he should remember: it is impossible to find any society and any point in American history where a zero-sum formula has led to increased affluence for the many and increased security. Zero-sum most often begets zero-sum, whether in the form of trade wars or actual wars. By contrast, the profound strength of the United States has been a vision of an open economy that thrives on education and innovation and an open world where the strength invariably overcomes the zero-sum countries and alliances that pepper the planet and always have. A vision of winners and losers invariably begets more winners and losers, and little else.

" President Barack Obama sharply criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for saying earlier this week that the black community is in the worst shape it's ""ever been in before."" ""I think even most 8-year-olds will tell you that whole slavery thing wasn't very good for black people,"" Obama told ABC News in an interview that aired Friday on ""Good Morning America."" ""Jim Crow wasn't very good for black people. What we have to do is use our history to propel us to make even more progress in the future."" Obama's comments reflected the wide gulf between the President and Trump that came into greater focus this week as race again became a top issue in the 2016 campaign following fatal police shootings of African-American men in Oklahoma and North Carolina. Speaking before a mostly white audience Tuesday in Kenansville, North Carolina, Trump spoke of the need to ""rebuild our inner cities."" ""Our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before. Ever. Ever. Ever,"" Trump said. The speech was part of a high-profile push by the Trump campaign to plug gaps in poll numbers with minority voters, and also to win over white voters turned off by divisive rhetoric from Trump that critics have repeatedly labeled as racist.

NBC reported the story, Thousands of people with tickets to DonaldTrump rally on Monday may not get into the event. German Arena will only allow about 8,000 people inside, and rally organizers are scrambling to find a larger venue. Lee County confirmed Friday that no permit application has been filed for any other venue. Ticket holders say it may be too late to find a bigger space. ?I am going to be pissed if Ican get in,? said Babs Littleton. She wants to see what Trump has to say, so she got a ticket to him. ?People who agree with him, people whodon agree with him, everyone is excited to go. He has definitely created excitement.? Sure, Hillary Clinton can win Florida.I not sure what the latest polls are. Regardless, if Trump continues to get people out to his events by the thousands, he will leave Hillary Clinton in the dust. And where are all the protesters that were appearing at all the Trump events? Did the Left run out of our money to pay them? The report continues, Ticket registration closed Friday afternoon. While the number of tickets distributedhasn been disclosed, the event is expected to attract between 9,000 and 15,000 people.

"An American pit bull that mauled a 6-month-old baby to death was kept in a tiny cage by its owner in the U.K.Bruiser owner, 23-year-old Claire Riley cruelly ""cooped up"" the dog in a cage in her small house afterRiley partner was sent to prison in July 2014. The couple's baby, Molly-Mae Wotherspoon, also lived in the house. The dog was rarely walked, given inadequate water and locked up in an enclosure for hours on end. Three months later, Bruiser escaped his cage in the kitchen, opened the door to the living room, and grabbed baby Molly-Mae?s head while she lay on a changing mat. The baby's grandmother, Susan Aucott, was supposed to be watching the baby while Riley was out for the evening. Bruiser had to be pepper sprayed and euthanized at the time of the incident, reports the Mirror. Molly-Mae?s injuries included a fractured skull, severe lacerations to the face and bites to all four limbs, according to The Guardian. She died of blood loss at the scene on Oct. 3, 2014. Riley was sentenced to two years behind bars for owning a dangerous dog and is banned from owning dogs for 10 years. Aucott was given the same term for failing to control the dog. Bruiser was known to be jealous of the baby, according to court records. He lived in the home with another dog, Pups, who was also kept in a cage. One vet described Bruiser as ?one of the most aggressive dogs she had ever seen.? The breed has been banned in the U.K. since the early 1990s under the Dangerous Dogs Act. Prosecutor James House told the court that Bruiser should not have been left in the house with Aucott, who had been drinking that day. ""He was an aggressive and dangerous dog and should not have been left in the house with a person who could not control him,? said House. ""The attack was sustained. Susan Aucott simply was unable to bring Bruiser under control or remove Molly-Mae from the situation."" He added, ?A canine expert has told us that the sound of Molly-Mae crying would have ignited a killer instinct in Bruiser which would have made him see the child as prey.?",0.007936508,0.011904762,0.011904762,0.011904762,0.023809524,0.23015873,0.003968254,1,-1,1
"Washington  President Barack Obama vetoed a bill Friday that would allow family members of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia, pitting him against Congress and both presidential candidates on an emotionally charged matter. The White House claimed the legislation could expose US diplomats and servicemen to litigation in other countries. Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress say they'll override Obama's veto next week. Obama has now issued 12 vetoes. If successful, Congress' override would be the first of Obama's presidency. Support for the ""Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act"" ran high among lawmakers, who overwhelmingly passed the bill earlier this year after pressure from victims' groups. The bill would end foreign countries' immunity in the United States from lawsuits, allowing federal civil suits to go forward if the country is determined to have had a hand in a US terror attack. In his veto message, Obama wrote he had ""deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, who have suffered grievously."" But he maintained the legislation would seriously hurt US national security interests and cause harm to important alliances, saying it ""would neither protect Americans from terrorist attacks nor improve the effectiveness of our response to such attacks."" He warned that the law would hurt the effectiveness of the administration's action against terrorism by taking questions of foreign states' involvement in terrorism ""out of the hands of national security and foreign policy professionals and placing them in the hands of private litigants and courts."" Obama also said the move would open Americans abroad, especially those serving in the military, to prosecutions by foreign countries, since this would remove the reciprocal agreements that now protect both sides from such lawsuits. He also pointed to complaints that allied nations have made about the measure. This legislation, he said, ""threatens to limit their cooperation on key national security issues, including counterterrorism initiatives, at a crucial time when we are trying to build coalitions, not create divisions."" Demonstrating the difficult political position the White House is in, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Obama's former secretary of state, expressed her support for the legislation Friday. ""Clinton continues to support the efforts by Sen. (Chuck) Schumer and his colleagues in Congress to secure the ability of 9/11 families and other victims of terror to hold accountable those responsible,"" said Jesse Lehrich, a Clinton spokesman. ""She would sign this legislation if it came to her desk."" Following the veto, Republican presidential contender Donald Trump said in a statement the move ""is shameful and will go down as one of the low points of his presidency."" Trump, too, said he would sign the legislation as president. Schumer, a New York Democrat who was a lead supporter of the bill, called the veto ""a disappointing decision that will be swiftly and soundly overturned in Congress."" Co-sponsor Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said, ""I look forward to the opportunity for Congress to override the President's veto, provide these families with the chance to seek the justice they deserve and send a clear message that we will not tolerate those who finance terrorism in the United States."" White House lobbying effort In recent days, some of the measure's supporters in Congress have expressed misgivings about the legislation, prompting a new effort by the administration to lobby against the bill. The White House indicated Friday that was still working to sway lawmakers against the bill, saying that some had indicated privately they had doubts about the measure's implications. ""If we're focused on the substantive, long-term impact on our nation's national security, that's what's driving the position, that's what's driving the President's decision to veto this bill -- not because it's politically convenient, it's not; it's political inconvenient,"" Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Friday. "" But when it comes to the stakes and the impact that this could have on our national security, the President is willing to take some political heat in order to try to do the right thing."" The lobbying effort on Capitol Hill against the legislation has involved the administration but also representatives for the Saudi government, which denies any involvement in the 9/11 terror attacks. The alliance puts Obama in the unlikely position of defending the same position as the Kingdom, with which he's had longstanding disputes over counterterrorism strategies and human rights. It also puts the President at odds with family members of 9/11 victims, who protested outside the White House this week and spoke alongside lawmakers from New York and Connecticut on Capitol Hill. They, along with other proponents of the bill, say the language is written narrowly to prevent the types of repercussions the administration predicts. ""We are outraged and dismayed at the President's veto of JASTA and the unconvincing and unsupportable reasons that he offers as explanation,"" read a statement from the 9/11 Families and Survivors. ""No matter how much the Saudi lobbying and propaganda machine may argue otherwise, JASTA is a narrowly drawn statute that restores longstanding legal principles that have enjoyed bipartisan support for decades."" Veto override plans Administration officials had been eying a Friday afternoon veto with the hopes of submitting it to lawmakers after Congress adjourned until November's election contests. But prolonged negotiations over a government funding bill and a package to combat Zika virus have delayed the recess, meaning lawmakers are still likely to be in Washington next week to cast an override vote. ""Our assumption is that the veto will be overridden,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Tuesday. House Speaker Paul Ryan followed suit Wednesday, saying, ""I do think the votes are there for the override."" But the Wisconsin Republican also voiced his own doubts about the legislation, saying the implications for lawsuits against Americans worried him. ""I worry about legal matters,"" Ryan said. ""I worry about trial lawyers trying to get rich off of this. And I do worry about the precedence. At the same time, these victims do need to have their day in court."" He was one of several prominent lawmakers who have expressed buyers' remorse for the proposed law. A pair of Republican senators, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have pushed for changes to make it more difficult for the families to pursue lawsuits but could also make it harder for the US to be sued for alleged wrongdoing. Opponents of the bill gained support Wednesday both from the European Union, which issued its opposition in the form of a ""demarche"" statement to the US Department of State, and from a bipartisan group of former national security officials, who penned an open letter to Obama. ""The harm this legislation will cause the United States will be both dramatic and long-lasting,"" the letter read, citing arguments over weakening sovereign immunity. Its signatories included veterans of Republican and Democratic administrations, including Stephen Hadley, a national security adviser to President George W. Bush; Michael Mukasey, a US attorney general under Bush; William Cohen, a secretary of defense under President Bill Clinton; and Richard Clarke, a national security aide to Bush and Clinton. The letter also noted the law, if enacted, ""will most certainly undermine our relationship with one of our most important allies, Saudi Arabia, and damage our relationship with the entire Middle East.""",0.035147392,0.002267574,0.004535147,0.019274376,0.06462585,0.293650794,0.011337868000000001,2,-1,1
"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry made an impassioned plea in front of the United Nations Security Council today for all sides in the Syrian conflict to live up to their obligations under a cease-fire agreement. The move may be the best chance for the U.S. to help bring an end to the violence, humanitarian crisis and displacement of thousands of Syrians. Interested in Syria? Add Syria as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Syria news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Kerry's determination to restore the cease-fire comes in wake of the most flagrant yet of the violations: Two days ago, a United Nations humanitarian aid convoy headed to opposition-held areas of Aleppo was destroyed in a prolonged airstrike. ""On Monday, 20 aid workers were killed in an outrageous, sustained, two-hour attack directed at a fully authorized humanitarian mission near Aleppo ? fully authorized,"" Kerry told the Security Council this morning. ""All of the permits had been given. Everybody was on notice."" U.S. officials believe Russian aircraft, not Syrian, were responsible for the strike but have yet to publicly accuse Moscow. Yesterday the White House said it could have been only Russians or the Syrian regime and that either way, Russia is accountable for the strikes, given its leverage over Syria and its commitments under the cease-fire. In spite of all this, rather than abandon the cease-fire, Kerry today urged the Syrian regime to adhere to its terms, calling for the grounding of all regime aircraft. ""Our purpose in this negotiation was to put an end to the kind of horrific and indiscriminate attacks that have been the primary cause of fear, of suffering, of displacement,"" Kerry said. ""And under our plan, all of this could be quickly accompanied by serious negotiations between the parties, aimed at a political transition and a conclusion to the conflict."" Meanwhile, the Russians have released a series of conflicting statements in an effort to justify the strike on the U.N. convoy. They suggested at one point the convoy was accompanied by an armed opposition vehicle and most recently suggested the strike might have been carried out by a U.S. drone flying in the region. The U.S. Defense Department quickly denied that, saying it doesn't fly aircraft over that area of Syria. Moscow has yet to respond to Kerry's request to ground all regime aircraft, but negotiations will likely continue through the rest of the week at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. Members of the International Syria Support Group are expected to convene again in the coming days. ""The future of Syria is hanging by a thread, and I urge this council not to give up,"" Kerry said today. ""And I urge the entire international community to get behind the best chance that we have yet had to reduce the violence, to provide humanitarian assistance and to open up the space for negotiations.""",0.024316109,0.0,0.003039514,0.021276596000000002,0.048632219000000004,0.26747720399999997,0.0,2,-1,1
" This Thursday Ohio Republican Representative Warren Davidson reaffirmed his statement that moochersand pretendersare blocking the Veterans Affairs? health care system. At a town hall event Monday morning in West Chester, OhioBoehner successor spoke to the Concerned Veterans for America, accusing the Department of Veterans Affairs? health care system of buckling under the weight of ?moochers.? ?Just like workers comp outhere got moochers, I wish that there were no vets that were the same sort of problem on our society,? said Davidson. ?But part of the problem is there are some vets that are moochers andthey clogging up the system. And we do as taxpayers want to make sure the VA filters out these folks that are pretenders. Just like we wish there were no people out there with stolen valor, butthat a problem in the vet community too.? In response, the GOP chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, Rep. Jeff Miller (R-FL), antagonized Davison for his reductive remarks but took it easy on him by saying, ?I can only hope that Rep. Davidson misspoke, and I look forward to him clarifying his remarks.? Joe Davis, a national spokesman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, also responded negatively toDavidson comments, saying ?honorably discharged veterans with service-connected wounds, illnesses and injuries, or who are indigent due to circumstances beyond their control, are not moochers.? On the other side of the aisle, Democrats also seized the opportunity to rejectDavidson remarks, calling them irresponsible and rude. Steve Fought, a Democrat inOhio 8th congressional district who ran an election against Davidson, said Davidson ?is the first congressman ever to blame the shortcomings of the VA health care system on the veterans themselves.? The chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, David Pepper, also jumped on the bandwagon saying, ?I would like to know just how he intends to decide which veterans are worthy of health care and which ones are ?moochers?. Perhaps the congressman is frustrated with the system, but the solutionisn to kick veterans off the health care coveragethey earned through service to their country.? Davidson, however was notably unfazed and doubled down on his remarks Thursday saying, ?As a veteran, I know the subpar care that many of my brothers and sisters in arms have received, and I will not be content until that is changed. Any effort to suggest I have anything other than asoldier passion for providing our veterans with the care they deserve is dishonest.? DespiteDavidson conviction about moochersand pretendersin the veteran community, only one of the four cases of VA benefits fraud found and prosecuted by the inspector general involved VA health care services. Hardly enough to make a dent in the administration of VA health care services, or make sweeping generalizations about a community that has had to make the most tangible sacrifices for the well-being of the nation.

"The Senate cleared the way today for a massive arms deal with Saudi Arabia to proceed, after voting against a resolution that would have blocked the transfer of $1.15 billion worth of military equipment to be sold from the U.S. to Saudi Arabia. The bipartisan resolution was introduced in the Senate earlier this month amidst increased reports of civilian casualties in Yemen at the hands of the Saudi-led coalition. Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., Rand Paul, R-Ky., Al Franken, D-Minn., and Mike Lee, R-Utah, who introduced the resolution, argued in part that by arming Saudi Arabia, the U.S. was complacent in these civilian deaths in Yemen. Amnesty International said in a statement Monday that a U.S.-made bomb was used in a Saudi airstrike on a Doctors Without Borders hospital in northern Yemen that killed 11 and injured 19. While the humanitarian group expressed disappointment at today's vote, they praised the increased ""voice of dissent"" in Congress regarding U.S. arms sales to Saudi. ""Today?s vote is the latest example of the growing voice of dissent in Congress when it comes to the United States? selling arms to Saudi Arabia,? Sunjeev Bery, Amnesty International USA Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement today. ?U.S. officials know that the Saudi government continues dropping bombs on civilian communities and yet the Obama Administration continues selling it weapons. This arms deal is bad for the people of Yemen, bad for the region and bad for U.S. foreign policy. President Obama should cancel it immediately,? Berry added.

Chris Murphy argued that the situation in Yemen, in addition to being an ""ongoing humanitarian disaster,"" has also provided an opportunity for al-Qaeda and ISIS to ""grow by leaps and bounds."" ""But the scope of this disaster for the purposes of U.S. national security interests is not just the radicalization of the Yemeni people against the United States, it's not just the thousands of people that have been killed, but the fact that this war has given, has given ground, an opportunity, for al-Qaeda and ISIS to grow, grow by leaps and bounds,"" Murphy said this morning, prior to the vote, on the Senate floor. Following the results of the vote, Murphy said he was pleased about the message that the vote sent, regardless of the results. ""Never before have so many Senators gone on record supporting a rethink of the US-Saudi relationship. Didn't win, but a strong message,"" Murphy said on Twitter, adding, ""Lots of Senators who voted for the sale mentioned to me how good it felt to be openly debating foreign policy in the Senate again."" Sen. Rand Paul echoed Murphy's sentiments in a tweet, saying, ""Today we didn't just debate Obama's $1.15 billion Saudi arms deal, we debated constitutional principles and war.""",0.030470913999999998,0.002770083,0.0,0.005540166,0.033240997,0.252077562,0.0,2,-1,1
"Who won the debate tonight? Donald J. Trump or the Lester Holt-Clinton team? NBC News? Lester Holt had his ?Candy Crowley? moment at the first debate of the 2016 presidential election on Monday night, bowing to pressure from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the liberal media by ?fact-checking? Republican nominee Donald Trump on the question of his support for the Iraq War. Holt lived up to the expectations of his peers. But he lived down to the worst expectations of conservatives, who routinely see Republican candidates treated unfairly by debate moderators. Hillary also went over the 2 minute mark several times, while there were several times when Lester Holt would cut Donald Trump off after only having a little over a minute to answer a question. Again and again, Holt asked Trump tough questions that were straight from the Clintoncampaign talking points, and which were obvious set-ups for Clinton to attack (and for fact-checkers to pounce on whatever Trump asserted in his own defense). Here are the five worst examples. Tax returns. Holt never asked Clinton about her e-mail scandal, about Benghazi, or about the Clinton Foundation and its dubious dealings. But he did ask Trump about his tax returns, arguing ? not asking ? that there might be questionable information in them that the American public deserved to hear. Birther conspiracy theory. Holt never asked Clinton about her past record of racist statements, including her ?super-predator? remarks as First Lady, or her explicit appeal to ?white Americans? in her 2008 primary campaign against Obama. Yet he asked Trump about the Birther conspiracy theory and cast it as racist. Stop-and-frisk. After an exchange between the candidates over the policy of ?stop-and-frisk,? Holt interjected to bolsterClinton point by stating, erroneously, that stop-and-frisk had ended in New York because it had been declared unconstitutional by a court. Trump countered, correctly, that the new mayor had canceled the policy before the litigation was over. ?A presidential look.? Towards the end of the debate, Holt asked Trump about what he meant by saying Hillary Clinton did not have ?a presidential look.? He did so after noting that Clinton had become ?the first woman? to be nominated for president by a major political party, thus setting Trump up as a sexist. As Trump answered, Holt interrupted him, then gave Clinton a chance to respond with her talking points aboutTrump past comments on women. Iraq War. The question of whether Trump supported the Iraq War or not has been widely debated. What is beyond doubt is that Hillary Clinton voted for it. Holt only represented one side of the debate about Trump, and never asked Clinton about her own vote.

"Six months after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, my then girlfriend (now wife), Liz, and I first arrived in St. Bernard Parish as volunteers. There we met a World War II veteran named Mr. Andre who like many of his generation had been proud and independent his whole life, never needing assistance and certainly never asking for it if he did. Though he used a walker, he insisted on holding his own food tray at the relief tent where we were working. Mr. Andre was a regular at the tent and after speaking with him at mealtime for three days, he finally broke down sobbing. He told us that every day for the past three months,he been sleeping in his pickup truck. Three times a day, before each meal, he would drive to a temporary FEMA site to apply for aid. Each time, he would be denied. Mr. Andre had reached his breaking point right there in front of us. Mr.Andre story is all too common after a disaster strikes. Eleven years after Katrina, despite tremendous progress, too many homeowners have not been able to rebuild. Four years after Sandy, thousands of New Yorkers and New Jersey citizens still have no predictable time frame for their return home. Now, after the torrential flooding in South Louisiana in August, more than 70,000 families ? the vast majority of which, did not live in mandatory flood insurance zones and, therefore, did not have flood insurance ? have just started down the arduous, painful slog that is disaster recovery in America. A delayed, unpredictable, inefficient, or otherwise prolonged recovery takes an enormous human toll. As it works now, the ?traditional model? of disaster recovery in this country forces too many of our fellow citizens to stare into the abyss of uncertainty after disaster, not knowing whenthey get home or how to navigate the myriad stepsthey need to take to get there. During this time, retirees and seniors are robbed of their golden years as their savings are drained. For the young, fleeting formative years of childhood and adolescence are disrupted, and parents struggle to bring a sense of normalcy to their families while taking on the burden of a rent payment in addition to their mortgage payments. Itdoesn have to be this way. Itshouldn be this way. People can be resilient to a point, but to maintain mental, physical, emotional and financial stability, they need predictability, certainty and transparency. They need hope and a clear path ? one unencumbered by false starts, dead ends and unnecessary red tape. For the past 10 years, Liz and I have been running SBP, a national long-term disaster recovery organization. In that time,we seen firsthand how Americans are hardwired to fix and solve problems, and answer the call in droves after disasters by volunteering or contributing. But we also have realized that, despite all of this generous support, there is only a certain amount of time that disaster survivors can endure, as they try to find the path home. Disasters today are more frequent, inflict more damage and occur in places with no history of such disasters. According to a 2013 study, since 2007, nearly 80 percent of the U.S. population ? 243 million people ? live in counties that experienced at least one weather-related federally declared disaster. Simply put, at a time when an efficient model is needed more than ever, disaster recovery in this country is not working as efficiently as it should or could. Nearly four years after Superstorm Sandy, only 50 percent of homeowners who qualify for assistance through New YorkCity Build it Back program have received it. And yet, Mayor Bill DeBlasio has stated his intention to declare victory and shutter the program at the end of the year. In New Orleans, 11 years after Katrina, 3,000 previously independent homeownerscan afford to rebuild without additional help. Citizens affected by the most recent flooding in West Virginia and Louisiana are unsure whether regional and partisan politics will prevent the allocation of federal funds. In a time of more frequent, severe and widespread disasters, the status quo in recovery cannot stand. We must not be afraid to adapt, innovate and reform our current long-term disaster recovery strategy. Admittedly, to do so requires a much larger, more nuanced policy conversation, but there are three straightforward suggestions which, if implemented, would greatly help shrink the time between disaster and recovery. First, the government should enable taxpayers to pre-register for FEMA and Small Business Administration Disaster Loans through their IRS tax filing. The majority of the information required to apply for FEMA and SBA aid following disaster is contained in annual taxpayer filings with the IRS. By enabling taxpayers to pre-register with FEMA and the SBA through their tax filings, citizens can be spared the aggravation ? imagine trying to produce documentation after several feet of water has flooded your home and town hall ? and delay in applying for federal disaster aid. Second, Congress should increase funding for AmeriCorps. National service ? specifically through AmeriCorps ? provides vital support and capacity to organizations that operate both in the short and long term after a disaster. Besides being a vehicle for citizens to serve their country, the very existence of the post-disaster ecosystem relies upon AmeriCorps and its members. Yet AmeriCorps funding is often uncertain, with lawmakers threatening to decrease or even defund the program on an annual basis. Given the increased pace and severity of disasters, lawmakers should stop viewing AmeriCorps as a line item to be cut for budgetary purposes and instead boost funding for AmeriCorps and provide more opportunities for Americans to serve hard-hit communities. Finally, the government should implement rapid, resilient, HUD-compliant housing recovery programs within the first few days after a disaster. Typically, it takes at least a year for HUD Community Development Block Grant funding to reach disaster affected communities. Waiting a year or more results in homeowner distress, community degradation, and increased costs to the federal government due to the amplified costs of mold and secondary damage. If instead, private capital investment stood up the first year or two of the recovery with a government guarantee, and was coupled with a streamlined environmental review processes that allowed damaged or destroyed properties to be rebuilt on their original footprint without the lengthy review required of new development, communities would recover much sooner. Those initial investments would then be reimbursed by HUD when those funds became available. In doing so, the pace and results of the recovery will have been sustained over the course of the initial year and the federal government would stand to save significant money. The cause of more frequent disasters is not up for debate. Thousand-year storms seem to be happening monthly. The effect too, is plain as day. In South Louisiana last month, more than 70,000 Americans lost their homes when an unnamed and unprecedented rainstorm dumped a record 30 inches of rain on the region over the course of two days. Homeowners who were told they had no need for flood insurance when they purchased their home, took on eight feet of muddy water, and are now staring into the abyss. The good news is that proven, actionable solutions exist to shrink the time between disaster and recovery. Now we must find the political will to fix this broken system. Our fellow Americans are counting on it. Zack Rosenburg is co-founder and CEO of SBP.",0.018094089,0.002412545,0.0060313630000000005,0.012062726000000001,0.025331725,0.28588661,0.0,2,-1,1
"I?ve watched every presidential debate ever broadcast, including the little-remembered John F. Kennedy-Hubert Humphrey contest just before the 1960 West Virginia primary, and for nearly 40 years I've analyzed how candidates win and lose them. But when I ask myself what kind of strategy I would devise for Hillary Clinton tonight against Donald Trump,I pretty much baffled. The problem is not just the unpredictable (to put it mildly) nature of her opponent. (Will Trump be low-key and calm? Will he attack her honesty? Will he turn on Lester Holt after the first tough question and walk off the stage?) The problem is that almost all of HillaryClinton strengths, in this strange election year, can so easily be turned into herweaknesses her vast experience in government. The more she emphasizes her qualifications, the more Trump is likely to respond with some version of: ?You?ve been at the center of power for 25 years? Thenyou one of thosewho created the messwe in.? So reciting her work with foreign leaders, for example, and contrasting it with Trump's utter lack of grounding in the world, doesn't seem to be promising. Story Continued Below Indeed, this debate offers Trump the chance to perform whatI called ?political judo??turning anopponent strength against her. (?Yes, Mrs. Clinton, your experience helped drag us into Iraq, and turned Syria, Libya, the whole Middle East into a staging ground for ISIS. Maybethat why your husband's CIA director, and BobbyKennedy chief speechwriter, are backing me.?) Further, there's asense highly limitedsense which Trump is in something like the position Ronald Reagan was in back in 1980. Among college-educated whites, who have resisted him so far, his task is to use the debates to say, ?I'm a reasonable person who knows what's gone wrong and who has the instincts to fix it.? It's a second cousin of the 1980 situation where many voters did not want Carter, but needed reassurance about Reagan, which they got. (There is a limit to this analogy, because for all of her difficulties, Clinton is in a much stronger position than President Carter was). By contrast, how does she try to gain strength on the issue of ?honest and trustworthy?? If Trump can be convinced by hishandlers theyexist avoid overkill here, all he has to do is to note what the FBI director or the New York Times editorial page has said. She can of course cite chapter and verse onTrump, Trump University, David Farenthold's expose of his charities in the WashingtonPost those issues are ill-suited, I think, to a face-to-face debate. One of her problems, longstanding, is that the stuff of which campaign collapses are made have been leveled atTrump he's still standing. Does any of this mean that Clinton is facing doom Monday night? No. It does suggest that her campaign should remember what debates do anddon do, based on a half-century or so of history. The Focus Is on ?Moments??ButThey Not Always The Key Ask any political journalist to recite the history of debates, and it would go something like this: ?Nixon looked pale and drawn; Ford prematurely liberated Poland from Soviet Control; Reagan said to Carter ?there you go again,? then asked Americans ?are you better off?? Four years later, he was incoherent, but then recovered by joking aboutMondale ?youth and inexperience.? Dukakis was insufficiently emotional at the prospect of hiswife rape and murder. Lloyd Bentsen told Dan Quayle was no Jack Kennedy. George H.W. Bush looked at his watch. Al Gore stalked George W. Bush, who froze him with a nod.? These are the moments that are played over and over again in the run-up to debates. They illustrate the fact that these events are watched intensely for the quip, the gaffe, the thrust, the parry that can sum up 90 minutes.It why debate prep spends an inordinate amount of time trying to come up with punchy, memorable lines??zingers??to win the attention and admiration of the audience. (It?s also why the late political journalist Lars Erik-Nelson scornfully said of his colleagues, ?You?ve all become theater critics.?) But in fact, this view of debates is not the whole story. Sometimes,it the cumulative effect of the exchanges that can determine who prevails. Look back at the first Romney-Obama debate in 2012. There was no one exchange, no one Obama stumble or Romney answer, that provided the ?aha!? moment that journalists wait for the way hounds wait for the first call of the fox. It was, rather,Obama petulant, defensive, sometimes indifferent answers that made even thepresident most ardent supporters believe he had been badly beaten. The presence of Trump clearly raises the odds that we may see a momentunlike any in debate history;that clearly what an army of reporters and tens of millions of viewers will be waiting for. But it may just be that it will be the totality of the hour and a half that will persuade a viewer to say: ?he seemed pretty reasonable? or ?she knows whatshe talking about and hedoesn.? This has special relevance for Clinton, who, as her longtime friend and one-time aide Patti Solis-Doyle observed, always seems as if she is testing every word before it leaves her mouth. A sustained, relaxed presentation over the course of the debate could be her best weapon against a Trump, whose ability to stay within himself when untethered to a Teleprompter is questionable. There Are Three Debates, NotOne That Can Matter A Whole Lot One key reason why the 1980 Reagan-Carter debate was so important is that it was the only debate between the two. Carter had refused to debate with third-party candidate John Anderson, so Reagan faced off against Anderson on September 21st. When the independent fell below the polling threshold, Carter and Reagan met for the first and last time on October28th a week before the election. Every other time, there have been three debates; which has meant there is a chance to make up for a less than successful debut.That what happened with Reagan in 1984, and with George W. Bush in 2004;it also what happened last time out, when Obama emerged from his daze and outperformed Romney in their two other meetings. Here, I think, is an opening forClinton in the town hall meetings, where she should be able to turn aquestion they are usually very lame ""what can you do for my daughter?""questions answers that fuse personal concern with a command both of her proposals, and ofTrump astonishing inability to remember what he has proposed from one day to the next. The danger for her is channeling her inner Al Gore, who challengedBush commitment to health care by repeatedly demanding: ""What about Dingell-Norwood?"" The opportunity for her is toargueexperience what she has worked for in public life has made the lives of real people better. (Further, the Town Meetingformat dozens of realpeople asparticipants the resort to personal insults highly risky). Trump Is Not the Only One Who Can Deploy Political Judo The potential for Trump to turn strength into weakness has its roots in the most singularly successful use of political judo. It came in 1992, when independent Ross Perot was asked if voters should be bothered by his lack of experience. ?Well,? he said, ?they've got a point. I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. I don't have any experience in gridlocked government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent, crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.? Judo, however, can cut both ways.There a clear opening for Clinton if Trump were to boast of his leadership skills, and his business success. ?Well, you might be successful, Donald, but we reallydon know becauseyou the first presidential candidate ever whowon show us his taxes. But you know, you should look at the business leaders who support me: Mike Bloomberg,who worth four times what you claim to be worth, and whodidn start with millions from his father, saysyou a con, a fake. So does Marc Cuban, who built his success from the ground up. But I do have toadmit?re way, way ahead of them in, unpaid workers, fleeced contractors and lawsuits.? Debates Are NOT Decisive One last note.It easy to assume that the fate of the world is at stake Monday night. A lot of post-election narratives over the years have located debates as the center of the story (?Reagan recovered from his first debate-gaffe and went onto win a landslide.? ?Obama was far more effective in the later debates and was re-elected??). But is correlation really causation? Maybe the economic boom of 1984 has a lot more to do with Reagan winning 49 states; maybe the clear if modest economic recovery played the key role inObama clear if modest popular vote victory. In their influential 2013 book, The Gamble, political scientists John H. Sides and Lynn Vavreck tried to measure the impact of debates, gaffes, and other ?game-changers? with real-time public opinion measurements. What they found was that even a dramatic event likeRomney first debate performance had a relative small, and relatively short-lived, impact. Compared to the ?fundamentals??economic performance and the ever-growing impact of a polarizedelectorate stuff of which a hundred overwrought post-debate analyses are made may be of only marginal significance. Of course, this cycle the fundamentalspoint to a very close race.

"Donald Trump will try to close the fundraising gap after he debates Hillary Clinton. | Getty Trump plans post-debate fundraising blitz Donald Trump is planning a ""national call day"" to Republican donors who've yet to open their wallets, hoping to close a massive fundraising gap between him and Hillary Clinton. Trump is summoning his top fundraisers to Trump Tower on Tuesday, the day after he squares off with Hillary Clinton in the first presidential debate. The fundraisers are being asked to ""prepare call lists of prospective donors"" and to recruit at least three people from their home states to raise funds on Tuesday, according to a copy of the invitation. Story Continued Below Two people briefed on the event said it would be geared toward attracting the support of Republican contributors who have yet to commit to Trump financially. Many of the party's top donors have expressed profound reservations over Trump's candidacy and have chosen to direct their funds to down-ballot races. The push comes amid mounting concern that Trump, who has lagged in the fundraising race, is being outspent and out-organized in the states that will determine the election. Hillary Clinton has outspent Trump on the TV airwaves by a stunning 7-to-1 margin and in many battlegrounds has dozens more offices and field staffers than the Republican nominee. Through the end of August, Clinton has outraised Trump $373 million to $165 million. Among those still on the sidelines are many of the GOP's biggest donors. Trump suffered a blow this week when Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson revealed that he would be directing $40 million to Republican groups devoted to protecting the party's congressional majorities and just $5 million toward electing the GOP presidential nominee. Adelson had once been seen as a potential major Trump donor and seen as possibly giving as much as $100 million to boost his candidacy. Tuesday's event will be hosted by vice presidential nominee Mike Pence and two of Trump's children, Eric and Ivanka. It is being co-chaired by Republican fundraisers Anthony Scaramucci, a prominent Wall Street investor, and Roy Bailey, a Dallas insurance executive. Bailey has long been close with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a prominent Trump surrogate and adviser. In the invitation, the campaign says it will offer four invitations to next week's presidential debate to fundraisers who pull in at least $250,000 by Friday.",0.017793594,0.010676157,0.003558719,0.007117438,0.042704625999999996,0.245551601,0.007117438,2,-1,1

""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?"" Biden said during a rally at Drexel University. ""Every president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about whatwe supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are."" Biden asked the crowd if they could imagine Ronald Reagan, ""saying it's good business to take advantage ofpeople misery, rooting for that misery?"" ""He does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have,"" Biden said. ""They disagree on how to make things better for you, but theydon take pleasure from 'You?re fired.' Theydon take pleasure knowing that they will benefit."" During the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton said Trump was rooting for a collapse in the housing market, to which the real-estate mogul responded, ""That's called business, by the way."" ""Whenyou sitting atop Trump Tower, in a semi-golden palace, not a joke, what do you care about the people that I grew up with?"" Biden said of Trump. The vice president also criticized Trump's suggestion that not paying taxes ""makes me smart."" ""He acknowledged that hedidn pay taxes because, he said,he smart. Makes him smart,"" Biden said. ""Tell that to the janitor in herewho paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.?

"I thinkwhat most likely is that the audience just thought the candidate was being funny. I mean,isn it a joke to say that anyone in the Clinton family is honest? Even if itweren a joke, the congressional candidate on the Democratic ticket had to have known that his comment would have elicited laughter from the audience. He made his comments during a debate with incumbent representative David Jolly. Former Florida Governor Charlie Crist is vying for Rep.Jolly spot in thestate 13th congressional district. The moderator had asked Crist if he was planning on voting for hisparty nominee.Here how he answered: ?I am proud of Hillary Clinton.

"Forrest Lucas? nomination would be a coup for the oil and gas industry. | AP Photo Sources: Oil executive on Trump's short list for Interior Secretary An oil industry executive who has spoken out against animal rights is a leading contender for Interior secretary should Donald Trump win the White House, two sources familiar with thecampaign deliberations told POLITICO on Monday ? a prospect that drew immediate condemnation from environmental activists. Forrest Lucas, the 74-year-old co-founder of oil products company Lucas Oil, is well-known in his native Indiana, where in 2006 he won the naming rights to Lucas Oil Stadium, the home of the Indianapolis Colts football team, for a reported $121.5 million over 20 years. He and his wife have given a combined $50,000 to the gubernatorial campaigns of Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, according to Indiana state records. Story Continued Below Lucas? company, California-based Lucas Oil, is a fast-growing manufacturer of automotive oils, lubricants and other additives used in everything from cars to heavy-duty trucks. One person briefed by the Trump campaign said Lucas is a ?front-runner? for the Interior secretary job. The person, who was granted anonymity to talk about private discussions, added that Trump wants a ?more business-friendly and business experience-heavy cabinet.? But environmentalists quickly excoriated the idea of an oil industry executive leading the department that oversees national parks and wildlife refuges, along with decisions about offshore drilling, fracking regulations and protections for endangered species. ""Putting an oil executive in charge of our public lands and precious coasts in places like North Carolina, Virginia and Florida is a virtual guarantee that Trump's promise to throw open season on drilling in our special places will come true if he's elected,"" said Khalid Pitts, the Sierra Club's national political director. David Turnbull, the campaigns director at anti-fossil-fuels group Oil Change USA, worried that Trump's Cabinet could be full of people with ties to the oil industry. They include Harold Hamm, the CEO of Oklahoma oil company Continental Resources, who has emerged as a possible pick for Trump's energy secretary. ""Catering to an industry dead-set on continued expansion of oil and gas drilling is not only totally out of step with climate science, but it's also out of step with the majority of Americans who are calling for a swift transition to clean energy and robust action on climate change,"" Turnbull said in an email. It would be nearly unprecedented for major oil executive to get the top job in the Interior Department. Current Secretary Sally Jewell was an engineer for Mobil Oil early in her career and often touts her experience fracking wells, although she is best known as a conservationist and former outdoor retail executive. Lucas? nomination would be a coup for the oil and gas industry, which has battled President BarackObama Interior Department for years over everything from Endangered Species Act listings to access to federal lands for drilling. Trump has cultivated close ties to the oil industry, which was once skeptical of his campaign for president. ""In a lot of ways, having an oil and gas friendly person in the Interior Department is more important to the oil and gas industry than having someone friendly at the Energy Department,"" one industry official said. Nominating Lucas would also break with the long-standing tradition of Interior secretaries coming from Western states. It would also likely draw rebukes from animal rights groups. Lucas, who owns a ranch and serves onTrump agriculture advisory committee, is one of the biggest donors to groups that attack the Humane Society and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and defend animal agriculture, hunting, meat consumption, rodeos and circuses. Another source with knowledge of the transition operation said Lucas was on a short list of about five names that are under consideration for the post, which has started to attract considerable interest from prominent ?anti-conservation zealots.? Donald Trump Jr., an avid hunter, has also publicly expressed interest in the job. Earlier this year, Lucas financed and produced a feature film called ?The Dog Lover,? which portrays dog breeders and puppy mills as being unfairly targeted by animal rights groups. The movie was backed by Protect the Harvest, a nonprofit founded and chaired by Lucas, that saysit ?Keeping America Free, Fed & Fun!? In 2014, Lucas gave $250,000 to the Protect the Harvest PAC, records show. Roger Ebert's website called the movie ?shamelessly manipulative? and ?a pretty bald piece of anti-[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals] and/or PETA propaganda,? noting that the movie ends with a call to moviegoers to look into animal welfare groups before donating to them. Animal rights supporters were quick to point out Monday that Lucas had put up hundreds of thousands of dollars into fighting an ""anti-puppy mill"" ballot measure in Missouri that was approved by voters in 2010. ""Forrest Lucas is a peevish advocate of trophy hunting, puppy mills and big agribusiness, and has never met a case of animal exploitation hewouldn defend,"" said Michael Markarian, president of the Humane Society Legislative Fund, which backed the measure in Missouri. Lucas? wife, Charlotte, who co-founded Lucas Oil, came under fire in 2014 for a Facebook post that criticized Muslims and atheists. ""I'm sick and tired of minorities running our country!? she wrote, according to news reports at the time. She later apologized. Lucas has donated more than $150,000 to a slew of Republican candidates and causes since 2006, but records do not show any donations to Trump. In an interview last year, Lucas did not sound particularly enthused about the New York City real estate mogul. Asked if he would be comfortable with Trump getting the GOP nomination, Lucas responded: ?It would be like when Obama got elected.I say, ?Idon really like it, but I have no choice andI have to make the best of it.?? A Trump campaign spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. Lucas could not immediately be reached and his office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"Story highlights Trump's comments came amid a report about his charitable foundation He said Tuesday he loves using ""other people's money"" Kenansville, North Carolina (CNN) Donald Trump bragged Tuesday there's ""nothing like"" using other people's money, hours after a report said he used more than $250,000 from his charitable organization to litigate lawsuits against his business interests. Trump, while calling for building safe zones in Syria financed by Gulf states, vaunted the benefits of doing business with ""OPM."" ""It's called OPM. I do it all the time in business. It's called other people's money,"" Trump said. ""There's nothing like doing things with other people's money because it takes the risk -- you get a good chunk out of it and it takes the risk."" His comments came on the heels of a Washington Post report published earlier Tuesday, which called attention to Trump's funneling of contributions from the Donald J. Trump Foundation to charities in order to settle lawsuits against Trump. Trump has only sparsely contributed to his foundation. Instead, the foundation is largely funded by outside donors -- not Trump himself. Trump did not make those comments in the context of that report on Tuesday.

"Story highlights Heather Bresch is Manchin's daughter and the head of Mylan Bresch became a target of derision over the summer after a nearly 500% increase in the cost of the drug Washington (CNN) Sen. Joe Manchin strongly defended his daughter, Heather Bresch, over growing criticism that her company dramatically raised prices for its life-saving medicine in order to enrich her company -- and herself. In an exclusive interview with CNN, the West Virginia Democrat broke his silence and sharply criticized lawmakers from both parties who have seized on the rising cost of EpiPen to bash his daughter's stewardship of her company, Mylan. He said lawmakers were trying to be ""sensational"" by seizing on Bresch's multi-million-dollar compensation. And he slammed an article in USA Today for questioning whether his wife, Gayle, improperly used her position in an education group to boost the drug's prices, calling it a ""cheap shot"" and ""tabloid"" journalism. He praised Mylan as a West Virginia company that saved the country $180 billion. Bresch became a target of derision over the summer after a nearly 500% increase in the cost of the lifesaving allergy drug EpiPen, which is one of the company's signature products. The drug, which cost around $100 in 2009, shot up to as much as $600. The move sparked outrage from parents with children who rely on the drug, and even prompted comments from Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on the need to rein in rising drug costs. One of those parents was actually a colleague of Manchin -- Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- and multiple members of Congress called for hearings on the spiking cost.

"A North Korean military soldier stands guard as North Koreans wave flags and cheer during an aerial display, in Wonsan, North Korea. | AP Photo DOJ: Chinese company tried to evade U.S. sanctions against North Korea A Chinese company and four of its employees accused of attempting to evade U.S. sanctions against North Korea were the target of a set of enforcement actions announced Monday morning by the Department of Justice. Chinese trading company Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co. Ltd., its majority owner and three of its managers are charged with conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations. They are also charged with attempting to defraud the United States and conspiring to engage in international money laundering. Story Continued Below The charges arise from financial transactions using U.S. dollars between Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development and Korea Kwangson Banking Corporation, which is under both U.S. and UN sanctions. Those transactions, according to the Justice Department, were conducted both by Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development as well as by ?numerous front companies? that it controlled. The Justice Department also announced a civil complaint, seeking the civil forfeiture of all the money held in the 25 Chinese bank accounts of Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development and its front corporations. Those accounts are subject to forfeiture, the Justice Department said, because they received hundreds of millions of dollars that arrived via the United States. Because the money was routed through the U.S., it falls under American jurisdiction, the department said. Pressure has mounted on President BarackObama administration to crack down on China, NorthKorea largest trading partner and international protector, since the isolatednation latest nuclear test earlier this month. Republicans and evenObama own former secretary of state Hillary Clinton have urged the president to more forcefully pressure China to enforce international sanctions against North Korea. Rep.

"Washington  A series of high-profile breaches and warnings from national intelligence leaders has elections directors in critical battleground states seeking federal help against possible cyberattacks. Officials in Pennsylvania and Ohio tell CNN they are working closely with the Department of Homeland Security to protect their elections systems from cyberattacks and breaches. Ohio is going one step further. ""We even asked the National Guard to attempt to penetrate our databases,"" said Joshua Eck, a spokesman for Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted. ""We've had a number of really positive tests. It has gone well and we've been able to find vulnerabilities and fix them."" ""Based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff, of California, said Thursday. Cybersecurity experts say the prospect of ""rigging"" the election, and changing the outcome, is practically impossible. Elections are decentralized: 50 states, plus the District of Columbia, run their own operations, not to mention the thousands of counties across the country that play a major role at the local level. Different jurisdictions use different voting machines, It isn't plausible for hackers to breach them all in one fell swoop -- penetrating one election system in North Carolina has no impact on Colorado. Furthermore, most voting machines aren't connected to the Internet, which inoculates them from outside intrusions. But hackers could still cause plenty of havoc in November, with attacks on registration systems or government websites reporting the results on election night. Many news organizations pull their results from those sites. ""Think about the chaos you could cause if you get one TV network calling the election for one candidate, and another network calling the election for the other,"" said Professor Herbert Lin, a cybersecurity expert at Stanford University. ""If your intent is to sow doubt and uncertainty, at least in the short term, affecting the media reporting could be really problematic."" DHS running 'Cyber hygiene scans' Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is the Obama administration's point man on election security, holding meetings with elections officials from across the country, and offering help to states that are interested. DHS is offering ""cyber hygiene scans"" that will remotely search for vulnerabilities in election systems like online voter registration systems and election night reporting infrastructure. It is also offering to send cybersecurity experts to states so they can conduct more aggressive in-person testing the final weeks of the campaign. Johnson recently laid out other federal resources for states in a memo last week , including a 24/7 center to respond to cyberattacks, and a list of ""best practices"" on how to secure voter registration databases. Pennsylvania has accepted the DHS help, both the remote scans and the in-person testing, said Pennsylvania Department of State spokeswoman Wanda Murren. Election authorities in Ohio are also accepting federal help. But not every state is happy to have the administration involved. Georgia's secretary of state publicly scoffed at these efforts and accused the federal government of trying to ""subvert the Constitution."" Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, a Republican, rebuffed the idea , telling Nextgov that the feds might want to ""subvert the Constitution to achieve the goal of federalizing elections under the guise of security."" However, his office later walked back the comment, saying they were not flatly refusing the assistance. A call for comment from Kemp was not immediately returned Thursday. Florida officials, whose recount debacle in 2000 led to the federal law which ultimately created voter registration databases, declined to say whether they were accepting help from DHS, citing security concerns. What are the threats? Perhaps the most serious vulnerability is the integrity of voter registration systems. Hackers can break in and delete or alter individual voter registration records, creating confusion on Election Day when voters show up to their polling place and their names are mysteriously missing from the rolls, or their address is changed. This summer, hackers broke into a stash of information for about 90,000 voters in Illinois , breaching a database with voters' names, addresses, sex and birthdays. And officials in Arizona took their voter registration system offline after they learned that a Russian hacker had breached their systems. Once hackers penetrate a voter registration system, ""the scope could be whatever they want,"" said Cathie Brown, who served as Virginia's deputy chief information security officer and is a cybersecurity expert with Impact Makers. ""Deleting an entire precinct of voters -- that's absolutely possible. The grander the scope, the more likely they'll get caught. But they might not get caught until after they've done the damage."" But at least one expert said that state elections directors have been dealing with technological threats for a long time. ""The state and local election officials, this whole notion of security is not new to them this is something they deal with all the time,"" said Tim Mattice, executive director of the Elections Center, which trains state and local elections officials on administering elections. Mattice's organization works with the professional group representing election officials, the National Association of State Election Directors. Mattice said that when DHS offered up help, most people understood them when they said they were making it voluntary and did not want to be viewed as coming in and taking over state-run elections. Ironically, Mattice noted that the focus on technological security got serious after Congress passed the national Help America Vote Act in the wake of the 2000 elections, which mandated that states develop integrated voter registration systems -- effectively placing all the voter data in systems that could be hacked. Asked how hackers got through in Illinois and Arizona despite the layers of security that elections officials already have in place, Mattice said it's the same problem any organization or business faces. ""You could ask Target how they got hacked -- these hackers are getting sophisticated,"" Mattice said.",0.046961326,0.0027624309999999997,0.011049723999999999,0.012430938999999998,0.077348066,0.270718232,0.0,2,-1,1
"Donald Trump thinks African-Americans are worse off now than they have ever been, and President Obama just took him to the woodshed for it. During a rally, Trump declared that ?African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape thanthey ever been in before.? The assertion suggests that slavery was a picnic for black people and that Jim Crow was heaven on earth. But President Obama set Trump straight during an interview with Good Morning America at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. ?You know, I think even most 8-year-olds?ll tell you that whole slavery thingwasn very good for black people,? Obama told Robin Roberts. ?Jim Crowwasn very good for black people. What we have to do is use our history to propel us to make more progress in the future.?Here the video via ABC. President Obama also slammed those who think racism no longer exists in this country simply because he was elected to the presidency or because some black people make a lot of money. ?It?s unrealistic to think that somehow that all just completely went away, because the Civil Rights Act was passed or becauseOprah making a lot of money or because I was elected president. You know,that not how society works. And if you have hundreds of years of racial discriminationit likely that the vestiges of that discrimination linger on. And we should acknowledge that and own that.? As President Obama said, Donald Trump could learn a lot from a visit to this museum. To think that black people had it easy as slaves is offensive andit almost as if Trump thinks they would be better off going back to being slaves. Sohe definitely on a slippery slope, and while that may get his white supremacist supporters frothing at the mouth, it does nothing to help him get black people to vote for him.

"Raleigh, North Carolina  Hillary Clinton -- facing a dramatically tightening race and a troubling lack of enthusiasm -- is looking to this steadily changing state as an opportunity to stabilize her path to the White House and force Republicans to play offense. A sign of how seriously the Democratic nominee is taking North Carolina: it's the first place she visited last week when she returned to the campaign trail following a bout with pneumonia. President Barack Obama traveled to Charlotte this summer for his first campaign appearance with Clinton and is expected to return to the state repeatedly in October. The focus on North Carolina -- a state President Barack Obama carried narrowly in 2008 but lost four years later -- comes as polls show Clinton faltering in other battlegrounds such as Florida and Ohio. A win here would almost certainly offset losses in those states and guarantee her the presidency. And the raging culture war over LGBT rights playing out in the state offers her an opportunity to appeal to progressives and encourage them to show up on Election Day. Clinton has reason for some cautious optimism. A Quinnipiac poll released September 8 shows Clinton with a 4-point lead, just outside the margin of error. ""It's a coin toss,"" said J. Michael Bitzer, a political science professor at Catawba College. ""We are dealing with a 45/45 split. The electorate is baked, the remaining 10% are folks who will decide at the last minute, and say 'I can't stand either one.' We are in a holding pattern unless something monumental happens."" Republican nominee Donald Trump is fighting hard for the state. He held a rally last week in Asheville and will be back in North Carolina Tuesday. But the election is playing out as the state is grappling with the fallout from House Bill 2, the so-called bathroom bill that requires people to use the bathroom of their biological gender. It also bans municipalities from passing rules barring discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation. Since the legislation's passage earlier this year, North Carolina -- with a long reputation as being one of the more progressive southern states -- has seen a blow to its image. The NBA, NCAA, and ACC have pulled major sporting events out of the state, resulting in millions in lost revenues, a substantial economic and cultural blow to a sport-crazy state. State politics upended And the state's politics have been upended. Republican Gov. Pat McCrory is lagging his Democratic challenger and GOP Sen. Richard Burr is in an unexpectedly competitive re-election race. Democrats see the issue as a rallying call to engage the Obama coalition and possibly, moderate Republicans. ""I'm running for the LGBT teenager here in North Carolina who sees your governor sign a bill legalizing discrimination and suddenly feels like a second-class citizen,"" Clinton said at her Greensboro rally. ""And if anyone wonders what the costs of discrimination are, just ask the people and businesses of North Carolina."" But Carter Wren, a Republican strategist doubts that House Bill 2 or McCrory's standing, will determine the presidential race here. ""The polling stuff I have seen on HB2, it didn't cut, everybody had an opinion, but it didn't change how people vote,"" he said. ""It's all about Hillary and Trump and mostly about character, that's what people are questioning more than the issues."" And Clinton is facing the same trouble here that she is nationwide: ginning up enthusiasm -- especially among young voters -- that she'll need to replicate Obama's winning coalition. Even voters here who are enthused by Clinton's candidacy recognize that others aren't that plugged into the race. JUST WATCHED Hillary Clinton: I'm not great at taking it easy Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Hillary Clinton: I'm not great at taking it easy 01:05 ""Some of my friends are on the fence. They say Trump is horrible, but they are not sure about Clinton,"" said Cydnee Mebane, 19, who saw Clinton speak in Greensboro. ""They say they won't vote or they will vote for a third party. With my generation, we are either apathetic or too smart for our own good."" Daisy Goodwin, 65, was initially for Clinton during the primaries in 2008, but flipped to Obama. She expressed fear over what a Trump presidency would look like, and frustration that during voter registration drives, ""a lot of people said they aren't going to vote."" 'Where is Oprah?' ""She should bring Barack and Michelle. That will turn people out and we have to go door-to-door,"" said Goodwin, a retired beautician from High Point. ""And where is Oprah?"" Another challenge for Democrats is broadening their appeal among white voters, who have been increasingly voting less Democratic in Southern states, a trend that can't be entirely offset by gains with other demographic groups. While the African American vote remained steady from 2008 to 2012, a notable share of white voters shifted from Obama -- he won 31% of the white vote in 2012, down from 35% in 2008 according to exit polls. Still, Trump has clear vulnerabilities. ""If I am Trump, my problem is with undecided voters who supported [Mitt] Romney,"" Wren said. ""There are a fair amount of those people who voted for Romney, don't like Clinton but don't like Trump."" That's especially true in North Carolina, a state with an influx of new residents drawn to a tech boom in cities like Charlotte and Raleigh. The population growth has swelled the ranks of unaffiliated and more educated voters. Clinton and her allies have flooded the airwaves with millions in ads, targeting veterans, black millennials, suburban white voters and black churchgoers. Nearly $13 million in TV ads have been reserved through November. Priorities USA launched a $400,000 digital ad buy on Facebook, Instagram and Pandora with one ad called ""Most Racist Person,"" where Trump falsely claims that Obama is not an American citizen.

Though reporters covering the Republican nominee will not necessarily travel at all times on the same plane as Trump, they will now be in a dedicated ""chase"" plane and will drive within the Trump motorcade. These moves will significantly improve travel for the media covering Trump, who last week were left behind when reporters got stuck in New York City traffic trying to get a different airport than the one Trump, whose motorcade cuts through traffic, was flying out of for an event in New Hampshire. Despite requests to wait for the traveling press, Trump started the event without his traveling press corps and mocked them for being late. Reporters will travel with Trump on his plane ""when logistically feasible,"" the campaign said, according to one member of Trump's traveling press corps. Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks, when asked whether the improved logistics were in reaction to last week's problems, said the move ""has been in the works for weeks."" Neither campaign has a full protective pool, meaning reporters cover the candidate as the president is covered by the White House press corps, from leaving their residence to return. Hillary Clinton's press corps have a quasi-protective pool, and have been traveling with her on her plane and within her motorcade since the Labor Day holiday.

"David Wildstein. | AP Photo/Mel Evans Federal prosecutor says Christie knew about lane closings NEWARK, N.J. ? Gov. Chris Christie was told of the George Washington Bridge lane closures as they were occurring in 2013, a federal prosecutor told jurors on Monday in U.S. District Court. David Wildstein, who has already pleaded guilty to playing a role in the incident, and Bill Baroni, who is now on trial for his alleged role in the scheme, braggedabout the traffic gridlock that lane closures were causing when they spoke with the Republican governor at a Sept. 11 memorial in Lower Manhattan, Assistant U.S. Attorney Vikas Khanna said. Story Continued Below The two Christie-appointed former Port Authority officials mentioned the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, Mark Sokolich, whom they are accused of trying to punish after he refused to endorseChristie reelection campaign, the prosecutor said. ?The evidence will show that Baroni and Wildstein were so committed to their plan that, during the precious moments they had alone with the governor, they bragged about the fact that there were traffic problems in Fort Lee and that Mayor Sokolich was not getting his calls returned,? Khanna told jurors during his opening remarks Monday morning. Khanna did not elaborate on what was allegedly said during the conversation with Christie, but he told jurors that ?evidence in this case may show that others could have, should have, perhaps knew certain aspects of what was going on.? Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Bridget Anne Kelly,Christie former deputy chief of staff, were indicted in May 2015 on charges of conspiracy, fraud and civil rights violations. Christie, who is currently a top adviser to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, has denied any knowledge or involvement in the lane-closing incident. And an ostensibly independent report commissioned by Christie said, referring to a much publicized picture of Christie and Wildstein chatting at a public event three days into the manufactured traffic jams at the bridge, that there was ?no evidence we have seen that the Governor and Wildstein actually had any substantive discussion of the Fort Lee lane realignment at that public event.? Wildstein, a sharp-elbowed political operator who was a boyhood schoolmate of Christie, has already implicated the two others and will testify during the trial. The trial is expected to last six weeks. The allegation that Christie was told about the George Washington Bridge Fort Lee access lane closings as they were happeningdoesn exactly contradict the governor's own words. But the prosecution's version of the incident does not square with thegovernor own claims, or with the report on Bridgegate produced by the outside firm hired by the Christie administration. The allegation that the lane closings were mentioned to Christie at a 9/11 commemoration ceremony in Lower Manhattan in 2013 is not new. But that 2014 report by the law firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher ? commissioned by Christie and paid for with millions in taxpayer funds ? not only denied evidence of a ""substantive"" discussion, but also said, ?It seems incredible that, in a public setting leading up to a 9/11 Memorial event, surrounded by other government officials and scores of constituents seeking photographs and handshakes, anything substantive or inculpatory would have been discussed."" The report went on to say that ?even if credited, any passing reference by Wildstein made in a social, public setting at the time of a public 9/11 Memorial event to traffic issue in Fort Lee would not have been meaningful or memorable to the Governor? and that Christie ?recalls no such exchange.? The prosecution's statement that Wildstein and Baroni bragged to the governor about what they had done runs directly counter to any characterization of the verbal update as a ""passing reference"" and makes it harder to imagine the exchange as one the governor could possibly fail to recall.Baroni attorney, Michael Baldassare, told jurors during his opening statement that Wildstein ? thegovernment star witness ? told prosecutors that other officials played a role in the alleged scheme. ?David Wildstein implicated so many people in this activity that it will boggle your mind,? Baldassare said. ?They?re people at the highest levels of government in New Jersey, and at the very top of the Port Authority.? At one point, Baldassare called Wildstein a ?ventriloquist?s doll, sitting on Christopher J.Christie lap.? While Baldassare said his client had no hand in shutting down the lanes or covering up the incident, he spent much of his time with the jury focused on Wildstein, whom he said thegovernor office had sent to keep an eye on Baroni. Baldassare worked to impeachWildstein reputation, even cursing his name and apologizing before doing so. He repeatedly called Wildstein a liar, saying he lied under oath before the grand jury that handed up the indictment in the case. ?David Wildstein is a vicious guy,? Baldassare said, referring to comments he said former coworkers of Wildstein had made about him. ?He?s a bully.I sorry judge, everyone ?he an asshole.He a horrible person.He the most complicated personI ever met. He is a vindictive individual who would destroy your life.? ?He had a twisted mind,? he added, again referring to others. ?He?s maniacal. I apologize, again ? David Wildstein is a miserable prick. The governor referred to David Wildstein as his fixer. His fixer. And the governor used to joke that David Wildstein was his Mr. Wolf. Mr. Wolf from the movie ?Pulp Fiction.?? The character, played by actor Harvey Keitel in the Quentin Tarantino film, was an underworld fixer who helped two of themovie main characters dispose of a body. At an appearance at a town hall event in Morris County, Christie avoided reporters' questions about the trial. Linh Tat contributed to this report.

"The New York Times issued a scathing editorial imploring voters to keep Donald Trump out of the White House. | Getty NYT to undecided voters: Don't hand Trump the White House The New York Times on Monday urged undecided voters to rethink their consideration of Donald Trump for president, warning them of supporting a candidate ?far more consumed with himself than with thenation well-being.? Days after endorsing HillaryClinton presidential campaign, the newspaper issued a scathing rebuke of the Republican presidential nominee ? hours ahead of his first one-on-one debate with Clinton. Story Continued Below In an editorial published Monday, the Times? editorial board reminds voters that the real estate mogul began his campaign 15 months ago offering ?wealth and television celebrity as credentials, then slyly added a list of fearmongering about Mexican rapistsflooding across the Southern border.? ?From that moment of combustion, it became clear that Mr.Trump views were matters of dangerous impulse and cynical pandering rather than thoughtful politics,? the board wrote. ?Yet he has attracted throngs of Americans who ascribe higher purpose to him than he has demonstrated in a freewheeling campaign marked by bursts of false and outrageous allegations, personal insults, xenophobic nationalism, unapologetic sexism and positions that shift according to his audience and his whims.? Now is the time for undecided voters ? as well as those ?hoping for some dramatic change in our politics and governance,? the board said ? ?to take a hard look and see Mr. Trump for who he is. They have an obligation to scrutinize his supposed virtues as a refreshing counterpolitician. Otherwise, they could face the consequences of handing the White House to a man far more consumed with himself than with thenation well-being.? From his business ?record rife with bankruptcies and sketchy ventures? to his refusal to release his tax returns to his embrace of Russian strongman Vladimir Putin and potential business ties to the Kremlin, the Times outlined ?how Mr. Trump is selling himself and why hecan be believed.? The list includesTrump waffling on policy issues, his intimation that he might try to persuade creditors to accept less than the U.S. government owes and a tax-cut plan that would cost trillions of dollars in revenue, among others. The Times mocks what it calls his ludicrous secret plan to destroy the Islamic State, noting that Trump has no national security experience and bobs and weaves on whether he would commit ground troops, and insists his heart lies ?with the anti-immigrant, nativist and racist signals that he scurrilously employed to build his base.? ?A change agent for the nation and the world?? an italicized subhead reads. ?There can be little doubt of that. But voters should be asking themselves if Mr. Trump will deliver the kind of change they want,? the Times cautions. Adding that voters should be wary ofTrump ?silence about areas of national life that are crying out for constructive change,? such as schools, poverty and racial progress, the Times concludes: ?Voters attracted by the force of the Trump personality should pause and take note of the precise qualities he exudes as an audaciously different politician: bluster, savage mockery of those who challenge him, degrading comments about women, mendacity, crude generalization about nations and religions. Our presidents are role models for generations of our children. Is this the example we want for them??",0.01758794,0.007537688000000001,0.0025125629999999998,0.015075377,0.047738693,0.278894472,0.007537688000000001,1,-1,1
"HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. ? Score round 1 for Hillary Clinton.That according to The POLITICO Caucus ? a panel of swing-state activists, strategists and operatives who watched the first debate here Monday night. The insiders? bipartisan verdict: Clinton dispatched Donald Trump in their first of three nationally televised meetings. Story Continued Below Overall, roughly 80 percent of insiders ? with equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans responding to the post-debate survey ? said Clinton did the better job at the debate, including 99 percent of Democrats and 57 percent of Republicans. Only 21 percent ? 1 percent of Democrats and 43 percent of Republicans ? picked Trump as the winner. Democrats said Clinton was prepared and succeeded in provoking Trump ? who began the debate speaking so quietly the audio engineers struggled to raise his volume to a comparable level in the debate hall but quickly became more animated in the face ofClinton attacks. ?No contest,? said an Iowa Democrat ? who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. ?Trump held it together for 16 minutes and fell apart.? ?Trump melted down,? added a Florida Democrat. ?This is bad for him. [It] confirms all the worries of swing voters.? Some Democrats predicted the debate would swing the momentum, which appeared to be with Trump, with public polls showing a tightening race. ?Donald Trump exposed himself to be a clown,? added a New Hampshire Democrat, who also predicted ?the polls will show dramatic movement in next 24 hours.? But a Florida Democrat countered thatClinton performance was unlikely to change fundamentally the trajectory of the race. ?It is becoming a base turnout election, and she did a great job tonight of making the stakes in this election very clear,? the Democrat said. Among Republicans, the tally was closer ? but that speaks to a divided party as much as actual ambivalence about which candidate performed better on Monday night. ?Trump was an embarrassment,? an Iowa Republican said. ?I'd hate to be the guy in the spin room lying about how Trump won the debate.? ?It wasn't close,? a Virginia Republican added. ?Sure, our tribal politics will force it to seem somewhat close, but even the most committed of Trump supporters know, deep down, that did not go well.? But there was a significant share of Republicans who thought Trump won ? most of whom saidTrump outside appeal could be the most memorable aspect of the debate. ?Hillary Clinton sounded like every politician has sounded for the last half century. Donald Trump did not,? said an Ohio Republican. ?This year that may just be enough.? ?Neither candidate earned a single undecided vote,? a Nevada Republican added. ?Clinton supporters will think she won. Trump supporters will think he won. Trump gets the nod because he did not completely implode.? Here are two other takeaways from the first debate: Clinton met expectations on Monday night, while insiders are mixed on Trump. The vast majority of all insiders, 88 percent, said Clinton met expectations going into Monday night. That includes nearly three-quarters of Republicans: One Florida Republican called Clinton ?calm in the face of an insane person.? Insiders were more mixed on Trump, on the other hand. Overall, 55 percent of insiders said Trump met expectations: 40 percent of Democrats and 68 percent of Republicans. ?There were no expectations,? said an Iowa Republican. ?He got off to a great start, appeared reserved, but then he took the bait. The sneers and reactions when Clinton was speaking undercut his first impression.? But for some Republicans, meeting expectationswasn good enough. The expectations ?were low,? said one Pennsylvania Republican. ?He needed to exceed [them], and he didn't.? And a Virginia Republican said Trump did little to appeal to a key group of Republican-leaning voters whom Trump is repelling this year: white-collar whites. ?He needs college whites, and he didn't connect,? the Republican said. Republicans are divided on the political impact of the debate. GOP insidersaren sure whether Trump is better or worse off after the Monday night debate. Asked whetherTrump performance makes it more likely he wins the race, just 31 percent said yes ? comparable to the 33 percent who said itdoesn. A slim plurality, 36 percent, said the debatewouldn have a significant impact onTrump chances. The debate was ?not fatal, but very definitely a missed opportunity,? said one New Hampshire Republican. ""Neither of them made a persuasive case that they were more fit than the other to be president. At this point that advantages Trump,"" said an Ohio Republican. ?Put plainly: he failed the presidential test,? a Virginia Republican added. ?And hiding out on Fox News isn't going to fix it for him.? But despite ? or perhaps because of ?Trump unconventional debate style, some insiders said his message could resonate more than the pundits think in the immediate wake of the debate. ?He spoke in a language that normal Americans understand,? a Virginia Republican said. ?America is looking for something different,? a Colorado Republican added. ?He is very different.? View The first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump The First Presidential Debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, on September 26th, 2016 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, NY. And some Republicans cautioned against reading too much into the first match-up. ?There are two more debates to watch,? said a Virginia Republican. ?Trump has more he can adjust, [while] Hillary is a fixed quantity as a virtual 30-year political incumbent. Trump will be more aggressive in the next two debates.? Among Democrats, it was more decisive: 60 percent said the debate made it less likely Trump becomes president, compared to 15 percent who said it makes it more likely and 25 percent who said itwouldn have an impact. ?Trump wasn't presidential,? a Colorado Democrat said. ?He needed to show restraint, and he failed. Tonight was his opportunity to show the country how he would govern, and he missed the opportunity.?

"On Saturday, September 17 at 8:30 pm EST, an explosion rocked West 23 Street in Manhattan, in the neighborhood commonly referred to as Chelsea, injuring 29 people, smashing windows and initiating street closures. There were no fatalities. Officials maintain that a homemade bomb, which had been placed in a dumpster, created the explosion. The explosive device was removed by the police at 2:25 am and was sent to a lab in Quantico, Virginia for analysis. A second device, which has been described as a ?pressure cooker? device similar to the device used for the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, was found on West 27th Street between the Avenues of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. By Sunday morning, all 29 people had been released from the hospital. The Chelsea incident came on the heels of an incident Saturday morning in Seaside Heights, New Jersey where a bomb exploded in a trash can along a route where thousands of runners were present to run a 5K Marine Corps charity race. There were no casualties. By Sunday afternoon, law enforcement had learned that the NY and NJ explosives were traced to the same person. Given that we are now living in a world where acts of terrorism are increasingly more prevalent, when a bomb goes off, our first thought usually goes to the possibility of terrorism. After all, in the last year alone, we have had several significant incidents with a massive number of casualties and injuries in Paris, San Bernardino California, Orlando Florida and Nice, to name a few. And of course, last week we remembered the 15th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks where close to 3,000 people were killed at the hands of terrorists. However, we also live in a world where political correctness is the order of the day and the fear of being labeled a racist supersedes our natural instincts towards self-preservation which, of course, includes identifying the evil-doers.Isn that how crimes are solved? Law enforcement tries to identify and locate the perpetrators of the crime or the ?bad guys.? Unfortunately, our leadership ? who ostensibly wants to protect us ? finds their hands and their tongues tied. They are not allowed to be specific about their potential hypotheses for fear of offending anyone. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ? who famously ended ?stop-and-frisk? profiling in his city ? was extremely cautious when making his first remarks following the Chelsea neighborhood explosion. ?There is no specific and credible threat to New York City from any terror organization,? de Blasio said late Saturday at the news conference. ?We believe at this point in this time this was an intentional act. I want to assure all New Yorkers that the NYPD and ? agencies are at full alert?, he said.Isn ?an intentional act? terrorism? We may not know whether it is from an international terrorist group such as ISIS, or a homegrown terrorist organization or a deranged individual or group of individuals. It is still terrorism. It is not an accident. JamesO, the New York City Police Commissioner had already ruled out the possibility that the explosion was caused by a natural gas leak at the time the Mayor made his comments. NewYork Governor Andrew Cuomo was a little more direct than de Blasio saying that there was no evidence of international terrorism and that no specific groups had claimed responsibility. However, he did say that it is a question of how the word terrorismis defined. ?A bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism.? Cuomo hit the nail on the head, but why did need to clarify and caveat before making his obviousassessment? The two candidates for president Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump also weighed in on the Chelsea explosion. Clinton was very generic in her response saying that ?we need to do everything we can to support our first responders ? also to pray for the victims? and that ?we need to let this investigation unfold.? Trump was more direct. ?I must tell you that just before I got off the plane a bomb went off in New York and nobody knowswhat going on,? he said. ?But boy we are living in atime better get very tough folks. We better get very, very tough.It a terrible thingthat going on in our world, in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant.? Unfortunately, an incident like the Chelsea explosion reminds us how vulnerable our country is particularly in venues defined as ?soft targets.? Now more than ever, America needs strong leadership which is laser-focused on protecting her citizens from terrorist attacks of all genres and is not afraid of being politically incorrect.

"For the first time in PresidentObama tenure, the Senate is set to override his veto of a bill that would allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia in U.S. courts. Interested in September 11th? Add September 11th as an interest to stay up to date on the latest September 11th news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest The president vetoed the bill Friday, citing concerns that it could open the U.S. government to similar lawsuits. ""Our concern extends not just to the impact this would have on our relationship with Saudi Arabia, but rather the impact that this could have on the United States' relationship with countries around the world,? White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. The White House is also concerned that the bill could tarnish the U.S. relationship with the Gulf nation. Saudi Arabia has itself spoken critically of and personally lobbied against the effort, maintaining it had no role in assisting the 9/11 terrorists. But the bill passed with unanimous voice votes in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, meaning the veto override, set for a Senate vote Wednesday and House vote by Friday, will likely get the two-thirds majority in both chambers needed to pass. ?I look forward to the opportunity for Congress to override thePresident veto, provide these families with the chance to seek the justice they deserve, and send a clear message that we will not tolerate those who finance terrorism in the United States,? Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, said in a statement Friday.

"Rep. Marsha Blackburn has said that the company and its executives have not fully complied with congressional subpoenas to turn over accounting records and other documents. | AP Photo House panel to vote on contempt charges for StemExpress A House panel will vote Wednesday on whether to begin contempt proceedings against StemExpress, a human tissue procurement company that used to work with Planned Parenthood. The House Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives will vote to hold the company and CEO Cate Dyer in contempt of Congress for not complying with subpoenas to turn over documents on its fetal tissue processing, Chairwoman Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) announced Monday evening. The panel would have to vote to send the resolution to the full House ? a matter that is unlikely to take place until after the November election. Story Continued Below The panel, which was initiated in the wake of the sting videos by an anti-abortion group targeting Planned Parenthood, has sought information from StemExpress for months. Blackburn has said that the company and its executives have not fully complied with congressional subpoenas to turn over accounting records and other documents. StemExpress executives and lawyers say the company has complied with the subpoenas and has offered to testify before the committee. Democrats on the panel agree the company has complied and blasted the investigation as a ""witch hunt."" ""The McCarthyesque threat that StemExpress ?name names? of all employees, or face congressional contempt is disgraceful,"" Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), the committee's top Democrat said in a statement, noting that StemExpress turned over 1,700 pages of documents. ""We will fight this continued abuse of congressional authority every step of the way.? The investigation into the fetal tissue business began in the wake of anti-abortion activist DavidDaleiden sting videos last summer. The videos suggested that Planned Parenthood illegally sold fetal tissue and organs to companies like StemExpress. Both Planned Parenthood and StemExpress denied doing anything improper and say the videos were selectively edited to create misleading impressions. In two of the videos, former StemExpress technician HollyO claims that she once saw another technician appear to obtain fetal tissue without apatient consent. StemExpress unequivocallydenied the claim.O worked for the company for only a short period. The committee issued dozens of subpoenas to researchers, abortion providers and fetal tissue companies like StemExpress. Republicans have focused in particular on obtaining StemExpress's accounting records, such as tax records and invoices, to see the company's expenses and revenues over several years. Republicans argue that if money was made procuring fetal tissue, it would be a violation of federal law. StemExpress, which used to collect fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood and send it to researchers throughout the country, ended its relationship with Planned Parenthood in August 2015. Blackburn told POLITICO last week that the panel was considering how to deal with the unanswered subpoenas. ""We have said so many times, 'Work with us,' and it is amazing to me that these entities are not working with us and helping us to make certain we protect these women and babies,"" she said.

"Donald Trump boasted about how young he feels. | AP Photo What Trump, Clinton said when they were asked about age Donald Trump feels like a man half his age, and Hillary Clinton is ?quite delighted? that the topic of the septua- andsexagenarian ageshaven been an issue throughout their presidential campaigns. Both candidates responded to AARP Bulletin for the cover story of its October issue, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO on Thursday. Trump issued written responses to six ofAARP 13 questions earlier this month; Clinton answered every question during her face-to-face interview in August. Story Continued Below Trump, 70, and Clinton, 68, were told that agedoesn seem to be a factor in their campaigns and asked if they feelthat ?a fundamental change in the views of Americans toward aging.? Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, boasted about how young he feels, echoing what he told Dr. Mehmet Oz during an interview last week in which he said when he looks in the mirror he sees a man half his age.Trump response also included a knock on the Democratic nominee, who recently took some time off the campaign trail to recover from a bout of pneumonia. ?Yes. Many Americans are living longer, healthier, fulfilling lives,? Trump wrote in response to the question. ?AsI said before, I feel likeI 35. Stamina and energy are important. As is a positive attitude and joy for how you spend your days.? During her interview, Clinton expressed her delight in the subject of age being a relatively non-factor this cycle. But she also spoke to the importance of available, affordable health care, a signature accomplishment of President Barack Obama, and how she wants that for everyone. ?I have been quite delighted at the outcomes of the [campaign] for many reasons, but certainly because theredon seem to be any arguments about age,? Clinton said. ?People can argue about our policies, our experiences, but I think it goes to show that what we are seeing happen is that if you take care of yourself, if you can afford good health care and get it, you can live a full and productive life much longer than people in prior generations did.? ?That?s what I want for everybody. I want everybody to feel they are at their best and thatthey able to continue to make a contribution and enjoy life as best as they possibly can,? she continued. ?So I appreciate the emphasis on healthiness and wellness, andthat something that I want to try to promote in the White House and get older people, not just younger people, to be payingattention really take advantage of opportunities and to do more.

" Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation.He surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes;he being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord. Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. ?For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia? he tweeted in July. Now ? brace yourself, this might come as a shock ? it appearshe been lying to us the whole time. An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has ?numerous ties? to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. ?The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars ? what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate?[and] be associated with Donald Trump? says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group. Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to ?large numbers? of Russian buyers ? so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as ?Little Moscow.? The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion. The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense ? they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth. ?I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personalconsumptiondon read books. Theydon go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht? says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as ?culturalignoramuses interested in social justice.? Sound like anyone we know? When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 followingMoscow annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves ? and Trump himself. ?We?ll be looking at that, yeahwe be looking? said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July. These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all,it that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

He also charges their actions led to the deaths of five officers in Dallas and others across the country. For that, this judge called him a clueless slave. Others on her Facebook page called him derogatory names and went to town on the officer. One of them was a Texas State Representative, if you can believe it. Sergeant Pennie recently petitioned the federal court to expedite his case due to the incoming threats received. Everything is about race now and cop-hatred. Idon even recognize my country anymore. Andrea Martin, 304th District Court Judge in Dallas County (D), should be removed from the bench permanently. She is supposed to be non-partisan, unbiased and fair as a judge. She is obviously not. She should be reported to the state bar and held accountable. From Breitbart: A Texas judge likened a black Dallas Police Sergeant to a clueless slave in response to thecop lawsuit against Black Lives Matter and its high-profile supporters. Andrea Martin, 304th District Court Judge in Dallas County (D), told her network of friends on Facebook Saturday that Sgt. Demetrick Pennie was like a slave that Harriet Tubman could not free because he could not comprehend his own bondage. The post elicited a number of supporters to JudgeMartin sentiment, typically calling Pennie a coonand other derisive messages. A sitting Texas State Representative apparently joined the racialist banter as well.Martin thoughts led others to compare Pennie to a ?coon?, Judasand Samuel L.Jackson house slave character Stephenin the 2012 film, Django Unchained. The derisive comments were repeatedly cheered byMartin lines of ?laughing-so-hard-I?m-crying? emojis and others. ? 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

"Boom! Kathleen Willey SaysClinton Victims Could Fill Entire Audience At Debate [VIDEO] Kathleen Willey, one well known former mistress of Bill Clinton, among an estimated 2,000 women over the course of his political career, was asked if she would attendMonday Presidential debate if invited by Trump. Her response? ?I would refrain for now. Let her do herself in on her own.? She continued, explaining that if every woman Bill Clinton had an affair with over the years was present at the debates, it would fill the hall. See her comment below: ?Most of us are well known and our stories have been repeated several times over the years, but what concerns me the most are the voices of my sisters who are still afraid to come out of the darkness. I have communicated with a number of them and they are still terrified of publicly sharing their experiences with the Clintons. The real story here is not one of our presence in the front row at any of these debates, but the unhindered lust for power that the Clintons have displayed for decades.

"Denver Broncos' linebacker Brandon Marshall lost another endorsement over his controversial protest against the national anthem. CenturyLink followed Air Academy Federal Credit Union in withdrawing support for Marshall, The Denver Post reports. The company said that while it respects his right as an American to show his dissent, his actions conflict with its values. ""While we acknowledgeBrandon right, we also believe that whatever issues we face, we also occasionally must stand together to show our allegiance to our common bond as a nation,"" wrote CenturyLink in a statement. ""In our view, the national anthem is one of those moments. For this reason, while we wish Brandon the best this season, we are politely terminating our agreement with him.? Inspired by 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, Marshall decided to kneel during the national anthem before the NFL game as a protest against police brutality and racism, BET reports. ?I?m against social injustice.I not against the military, the police or America at all.I against social injustice,? Marshall explained. ?People thataren minorities, theydon know whatit like to be a minority in this country,? he added. ?AndI not sayingit terrible. I love this country. We have great opportunities, but at the same time, ifyou not a minority youdon understand. I speak for everybody when I say that, because I know they agree with me."" Since then, Marshall has experienced intense backlash, ranging from withdrawal of endorsements to loss of fans. One man even set an orange shirt with Marshall's name on it ablaze. Despite the criticism, the once fan-favorite Marshall has no regrets, will kneel again during the Sept. 15 game, and says he sends love to all. ""It?s cool, because people can call me the N-word or cuss or at me or say they wishI break my neck all they want,"" he said. ""There?s no backlash from me. Hatecan drive out hate.

"Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump. First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote. In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation. As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process. ?There?s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, theywon know the law, andthey be engaging in discriminatory challenges,? Gitlin said. ?That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.? As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim. Andthat exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants. ?We?re going to watch Pennsylvania,? Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. ?Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other peopledon come in and vote five times. If you do that,we not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion ? I really mean this, Pennsylvania ? is if cheating goes on.? Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to ?Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!? In response toTrump claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage. With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly inTrump favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.

" DonaldTrump charity non-profit Trump Foundation does not exist for its stated purpose of helping those in need, unless one believes Trump himself is among the needy. Yes, Trump was so desperately in need he used the TrumpFoundation funds to purchase himself a lunch with a Hollywood actress. In 2008, Trump was a guest at a Gucci charity auction where he had an opportunity to bid on something he found too irresistible to pass up: a trip to France which included lunch with Salma Hayek which would take place in the husband of Hayek billionaireFran-HenriPinault vineyard. Comedian Chris Rock was hosting the auction and said the auction included ?Salma Hayek and her breasts?, which was like blood in the water for Trump. He feverishly bid on the potential meeting all the way up to the tune of $120,000 of the TrumpFoundation money. Surely a ritzy meal in abillionaire vineyard was the best way for Trump to help the needy. Trump bidding on the auction trip with thefoundation money very likely violated a non-profit law which prohibits ?self-dealing? as 501c3 organizations are required to disclose any use of money to purchase gifts for anorganization executives.Trump campaign says he did not personally take the trip, but could also not offer an elaboration as to who did actually take the trip to France. Even if Trump had given the trip to a family member, he would still be in violation. For her part Hayek, while a guest on ?Jimmy Kimmel Live? on March 30, 2016, said she and Trump have known each other for many years but did not state when they first met. She went on to callTrump politics madnessand wondered why so many individuals are supporting him. In later media appearances, Hayak was not nearly as charitable about Donald Trump. While a guest on ?The Late Late Show With James Corden? on August 4, 2016 Hayak said of Trump, ?We have a first-grade boy running for President of the United States.? Hayek has not been quiet about Trump ?s hateful rhetoric but she gave him points for showing the world racism still exists. While being interviewed on ?America with Jorge Ramos? on August 6, 2016 Hayak said, ?The good thing about what Trump did is thatit shown a light to the level of the problem of racism.? It is safe to say that during their years of knowing one another Hayek has had enough ofTrump sub-human personality, and if the two were to meet and converse in the future it would be a terse conversation.

"The latest national presidential poll has some encouraging news for the campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, showing a 6-point lead for her over Republican candidate Donald Trump. Interested in Elections? Add Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Clinton received 43 percent support from likely voters in the poll, from NBC and The Wall Street Journal, compared with Trump's 37 percent. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson maintained his third position with 9 percent, and Green Party nominee Jill Stein trailed with 3 percent. In a head-to-head matchup, Clinton's lead expands to 7 points over Trump, 48 to 41. The margin of error of the poll is 3.2 percentage points. After the Democratic National Convention in July, polls showed Clinton's lead over Trump ballooning to upward of 10 points in early August before returning to tighter margins in recent weeks. Surveys by Fox News and CBS/New York Times last week showed a spread between the two candidates within the polls' margin of error. Today's numbers give Clinton her largest margin since Aug. 31, when a Fox News poll gave her a 6-point edge. Clinton received more support than usual from registered male voters in the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. Trump maintained higher levels of backing from the demographic, garnering 46 percent support to Clinton's 44 percent, but the difference is much narrower than in earlier polls. In additional questions, respondents expressed concern about Trump's words and actions on the campaign trail, with 69 percent of those surveyed reporting that they have reservations about aspects of his campaign, with 54 percent saying they have ""major"" concerns. Specifically, 33 percent of likely voters reported dismay over Trump's temperament; 27 percent said his comments about women, immigrants and Muslims worry them the most; and 13 percent were most disturbed by his compliments for Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"In a race as close as this one, a debate can alter the trajectory. | AP Photo Will Trump get a bump? It's been a long time since the polls showed this much volatility in a presidential election. If recent history is any guide for the first debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the polls will become more volatile in the ensuing days, bouncing around more than during the more stable periods of the campaign. But then the race will return to its normal equilibrium, reflecting largely locked-in perceptions of the two candidates. That's no certainty, though. In a race as close as this one, a debate can alter the trajectory of a race ? as in 1976, when Gerald Ford was surging in the polls in the fall but may have seen his momentum stunted by a poor performance in a foreign-policy debate with Jimmy Carter in which the Republican claimed there was ?no Soviet domination? of Eastern Europe. Story Continued Below The more frequent outcome resembles what happened in 2012, when Mitt Romney saw his poll numbers swell after a strong performance in the first debate, but fade just as quickly. Same for the 2000 presidential nail-biter, when polls after the first debate showed a brief bump for George W. Bush before returning to an Al Gore lead before the second debate. And in 1984, Walter Mondale cut into RonaldReagan lead after their first debate, but Reagan parriedMondale attacks in their second meeting and resumed on course for his landslide victory. The most interesting potential analog to this year's Hofstra University debate might be 1980. Carter and Reagan debated only once that year, with Reagan getting a slight bounce after their debate. But the most consequential part of that campaign might be the candidate whowasn on stage: John Anderson, the GOP congressman from Illinois who ran for president as an independent. Carter declined to debate Anderson, so the first-term incumbent skipped the first debate. Anderson had been polling at about 15 percent in mid-September, according to Gallup ? but he received only about 7 percent of the vote on Election Day. Support for third-party candidates this year rivalsAnderson backing: Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein are combining for about 10 percent of the vote in likely-voter surveys. (Ross Perot in 1992 also had significant support, but he participated in debates with George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton.) There are some parallels in the 2016 campaign ? and reasons to believe the three debates, starting with Monday night's, could be decisive. 1. The race is closer than recent elections. The national polls out on Monday set the stakes: Clinton and Trump are even in a Bloomberg Politics survey, and Clinton leads by 1 point in a Quinnipiac University poll and 4 points in a Monmouth University poll. In the poll averages, Clinton leads Trump by a slim margin: 2.2 points in the RealClearPolitics average, as of Monday afternoon.That closer than most recent elections. On the eve of the first debate in 2012, President Barack Obama led Romney by 3.1 points in the RealClearPolitics average, and the Democrat had a 4.2-point lead over John McCain in 2008. George W. Bush led John Kerry by 6 points on the eve of their first debate in 2004. Andit close in the battleground states, too. InPOLITICO Battleground States polling average, Clinton has a lead of 5 points or greater in six states: Colorado, Michigan, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. But the most recent polls in Colorado, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin show a much closer race. Trump, meanwhile, has pulled narrowly ahead in Iowa and Ohio. The two candidates are within a single point in three states: Florida, Nevada and North Carolina. 2. More voters are up for grabs this year. Neither Clinton nor Trump is popular: In both the Bloomberg and Monmouth polls, majorities of likely voters have negative impressions of each candidate. But between the candidates? poor image ratings and the large segment of voters backing either Johnson or Stein,there more volatility in this race than other recent elections. As of Monday afternoon, the RealClearPolitics average showed Clinton at 46.2 percent and Trump at 44 percent in a two-way matchup. (In a four-way matchup, Clinton is at 42.9 percent and Trump at 41.2 percent.) That leaves more voters up for grabs than in recent elections. In 2012, Obama led Romney in the RealClearPolitics average, 49.1 percent to 46 percent, combining for more than 95 percent. In 2008,Obama lead over McCain stood at 47.9 percent to 43.7 percent, combining for nearly 92 percent. In 2004, Bush led Kerry, 49.5 percent to 43.5 percent, combining for 93 percent. (In 1980, a pre-debate Gallup poll showed Carter narrowly ahead of Reagan by 3 points, 45 percent to 42 percent, with Anderson at 9 percent.) Both candidates still face enormous headwinds in changing voters? perceptions of them beginning on Monday night, but there are voters out there whohaven yet committed to either candidate. 3. A massive audience is expected to watch. Television ratings for Mondaynight debate could challenge the all-time record: the nearly 81 million people who watched the Carter-Reagan debate in 1980, according to Nielsen. The debate is going up against ?Monday Night Football? on ESPN ? a matchup of two of the weaker teams in pro football: the Atlanta Falcons and New Orleans Saints. But the debate will be on all the broadcast networks and each of the cable-news outlets. (The game will air instead of the debate on the NBC affiliate in New Orleans.) Even ESPN thinks the gamewon be a significant drag on debate ratings, with an executive telling Sports Illustrated ?it?s going to be a rough night? for football viewership. If the debatedoesn outrate 1980, it should still draw more eyeballs than the first debates in more recent elections: The first debate in 2012 drew 67 million television viewers, compared to 52 million in 2008, 63 million in 2004 and 47 million in 2000. Usually, according to Nielsen data, the first debate in a given year outrates the subsequent debates ?that been true in three of the past four elections. That makes Monday night the best chance for both Clinton and Trump to claim an advantage in a close race. ?Maybe two-thirds of the people who vote in this election are going to watch the entire debate,? former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said Monday morning on MSNBC. ?This is an incredible moment for both candidates to speak directly? to voters.",0.011378003000000001,0.001264223,0.003792668,0.01011378,0.034134008,0.20101137800000002,0.011378003000000001,2,-1,1

"Even though Donald Trump (sort of) dropped the birtherissue,there one pro-Trump surrogate who ? in the tightest re-election fight of his life ? is still pledging to continue his investigation into PresidentObama birth certificate. Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was recently recommended for criminal court due to the continuation of racial profiling and perjury, told a group of Tea Party activists that he is certain BarackObama birth certificate is forged and will do everything he can to prove it: ?I?m not going to give up, andwe looking into it. Idon know howit going to turn out. Idon care wherehe from. We are looking at a forged document. Period. I had nothing to do with Trump on the birth certificate. We did it on our own, because of you guys.? The room of 200 or so activists were of course energized byArpaio pledge to unleash the ?truth.? Before speaking to the crowd, Arpaio told reporters that it was the Tea Party activists in Maricopa County that got him stuckwith the birther issue after World Net Daily, a right-wing publication known for conspiracy theories, had a reporter speak to another group, and subsequently gathered almost 250 signatures demanding Arpaio investigate. He complied, launching his investigation last week. According to Arizona Central: Mike Zullo, the lead investigator on the case and commander ofArpaio Cold Case Posse, told the crowd that he knewTrump statement was a ?punch in the gut, because it was unexpected.? Zullo said he thoughtTrump statement was ?strategic.? ?It?s not going to deter us,? Zullo said. ?It?s not going to stop us. I am closer than ever.? Zullo also claims that a nurse who worked at the hospital where President Obama was born, the Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, denies that such a birth ever happened. Well there you have it. Not only are Maricopa County residents footing the bill forArpaio legal woes (yet again), they are now paying for another investigationinto PresidentObama birth certificate. Is this what Republicans mean by ?fiscal responsibility?? In Maricopa County, there are almost 4.2 million taxpaying citizens. And now they are paying theirSheriff office their tax dollars to investigatesome fringe conspiracy supported by 250 activists. Think about that. Maybethat why Arpaio is losing his re-election bid to a Democrat, Paul Penzone, and it might also explain why his poll numbers are plummeting. Good thinghe focusing on the issues that matter.

" The protests that shook the city of Charlotte last night and injured sixteen police officers have continued into a second night. One person has been shot dead; it is still unclear whether or not the police or a civilian was the shooter. The public displays of frustration over the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott have mostly been peaceful but certain agitators have been escalating the situation with rocks and looting. The police, in their imposing riot gear and hurling tear gas into the crowds, are not de-escalating matters. The protesters are demanding that the police release the video of the killing of Keith Lamont Scott; the state is responding the only way it knows how ? with violence. We hope that protesters will remain peaceful and understand their frustration with the reckless enthusiasm with which American police officers seem to be killing African-American citizens.

The Democratic presidential nominee took a page from President BarackObama playbook with her appearance on ?Between Two Ferns? Thursday.Clinton team got the ball rolling only after the Democratic presidential nominee told the Senate Democratic Caucus how impressed she was withObama 2014 appearance on the show to pitch the Affordable Care Act. ?It was actually her idea, strangely enough,? comedian Scott Aukerman, who directs and executive produces the web series, said. ?? She told her team she wanted to do it and that she really liked the one with President Obama, so that kind of made the process really easy. Wedidn have to go through the hoops we sometimes have to go through in order to even get Hollywood people to do it.? The interview was taped on Sept. 9, the same day Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia by her doctor. Itwasn until later that the Funny or Die production team found out Clinton had been fighting pneumonia when she settled in for the interview. Aukerman said she arrived at the end of the day, a couple of hours behind their original scheduled time, but the crew had no idea she had been feeling unwell. ?We kind of went, ?she had pneumonia?!,?? Aukerman said. ?Wecouldn believe it. The one clue we had was that she was drinking hot water.? The interview was taped at the New York Historical Society, and Aukerman said it was mostly improvised. As a result of the improvisation, most of the questions Galifianakis asked Clinton had not been cleared with the candidate or withClinton team. Aukerman said that it is unlikely that Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, will make a similar appearance on the show. ?No, we have not invited Trump to do 'Between Two Ferns,'? Aukerman said. ?Idon think he would do it ? Idon think he has thick enough skin."" ""Iwouldn be surprised if his team reached out, butI be surprised if it ever were to happen in the same way this happened, with us being able to improvise questions,"" he added. If Trump does do the show, don't be surprised if it is quietly released with little fanfare, just as Clinton's interview was. ""Wehadn done one in a couple years so wedon overdo them, so every time we do one,it a surprise,"" Aukerman said. ""Wedon put out press releases that we're about to put one out, we sneak them out in the middle of the night.""",0.038461537999999997,0.002747253,0.013736264,0.019230768999999998,0.071428571,0.20604395600000003,0.0,2,-1,1
"Using Skittles to make a point about ""our Syrian refugee problem"" didn't go over too well with Mars Inc., but the candy maker's rebuke of Donald Trump Jr.'s controversial tweet is hardly a first. The eldest Trump son posted a photo of a bowl of Skittles and a caption that reads, ""If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful?

He also didn't remove his Instagram post of Sept. 11, which was meant to be a play on Hillary Clinton's reference to some of his father's supporters as ""a basket of deplorables."" That photo, which he wrote was sent to him by ""a friend,"" replaced images from the movie ""The Expendables"" with pictures of Donald Trump Sr., alt-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, alt-right blogger Milo Yiannopolous and other well-known Trump supporters like Gov.

Donald Trump Jr. has been actively involved in his father's campaign, in public and private. He was the one to cast the convention floor vote for his father that put the Republican presidential candidate over the top and secured him the nomination. Of the three Trump children active in their father's campaign, Donald Trump Jr. was the first to give a speech at the party convention in Cleveland this summer ? which was well received by many in the audience. ABC News ""Donald Trump Jr. was so excellent that my brain was already thinking, ?What should we run him for?'"" Trisha Turner, the president of the New York State Federation of Republican Women, told ABC News at the convention. He has also played a significant role behind the scenes of his father's campaign.

"Allow me to begin by saying former DNC chair Howard Dean is the f*cking man. After tweeting that Donald Trump might be on cocaine ? a reasonable observation based on theGOP actions during the first presidential debate ? he could have backed down under scrutiny. He could have caved and apologized. Instead, he made his case. Dean, a physician who is qualified to speculate ? though in his own words not diagnose without examining Trump in person ? responded to criticism of his remarks on MSNBC. ?Idon make diagnosis on the television,it medically improper,? he told Kate Snow Tuesday, a subtle jab at Trump and his legion of Fox News doctorsfeverishly trying to diagnose Clinton with every neurological disorder under the sun because she coughed that one time and contracted pneumonia the other. ?But Idon think this was a ridiculous idea. Something funny was going on with Trump last night.? Something ridiculouswas indeed going on. Trump spent his evening screaming about ridiculous conspiracy theories, attacking hisopponent staminabased on a minor illness, interrupting Clinton constantly, guzzling water, sweating profusely, and other things that would be expected from his meth-addled Twitter followers rather than a serious presidential candidate. ?Here?s the interesting constellation: he sniffs during the presentation, which is something that users do. He also has grandiosity, which is something that accompanies that problem. He has delusions,I not talking about being crazy, but for example when he told everybody he was very smart not to pay taxes and then denied that he said after he said it it in front of 100 million people,? Dean said. ?He thinks somehowhe not going to get caught, that is delusional.? He has trouble with pressured speech,? the former Vermont governor added. ?He interrupted, as you pointed out, Hillary Clinton twenty-nine times. Hecouldn keep himself together.? ?Do I think at 70 years old he has a cocaine habit? Probably not,? Dean concludes. ?Butit something that I think would be interesting to ask him, to see if he ever had a problem with that.? Asked for clarification if he thinks Trump has a ?cocaine habit,? Dean replied ?Idon think he has a cocaine habit,? placing special emphasis on the word ?habit.? In other words, it might be a stretch to say Trump is addicted to cocaine, but it is possible that he used it to pep himself up before the debate. In an effort to deflect from the allegation, Trump assured the public that he just had a cold, but Stephen Colbert put it best when he said The Donald ?sounded like he was trying to get over a cold using cocaine.? Wecan know for sure if Trump has ever been treated for addiction, as he refuses to release his records ? and since Trump should be held to the same standards to which he holds Hillary Clinton,it not unreasonable to question if he has been using cocaine (especially given the crazy, whacked-out bonkers stuff he says in public).

"Monday night was the most-watched debate in American history. Well over 80 million people tuned in to see Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump face off, setting a new record in the sixty year history of televised presidential debates. According to Nielsen, the debate averaged a total of 84 million viewers across 13 of the TV channels that carried it live. Many millions also watched the debate via live streams on the web. Nielsen's 84 million total counts people who watched via traditional TV channels at home. People who watched the debate at parties, bars, restaurants, and offices were not counted. Neither were C-SPAN viewers. This means the actual total audience is even higher. On the TV side, CNN and other cable news channels saw big increases over past election years. So did the broadcast networks. NBC had the biggest audience overall, partly because ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt was the moderator of the debate. Upwards of 18 million people watched the debate on NBC. ABC drew 13.5 million viewers, CBS drew 12.1 million, Fox News drew 11.4 million, CNN drew 9.9 million, the Fox broadcast network drew 5.5 million, and MSNBC drew 4.9 million. The debate was also a hit on Spanish language television, attracting 2.5 million viewers on Univision and 1.8 million on Telemundo. Trump may have been the ratings magnet, but Clinton may have been the beneficiary of the ratings bump. By Tuesday there was a media consensus that Clinton had prevailed in the debate. The debate viewership number to beat was 80.6 million, set back in 1980, when Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan debated just once before the election. More recently, the first Obama-Romney debate in 2012 averaged 67 million viewers. Detailed Nielsen data confirms that viewership stayed high the entire time. Contrary to some speculation, there was not a big drop-off after the first 30 minutes of the 98-minute debate. The vast majority of viewers kept watching until the very end, a fact that the Clinton campaign celebrated on Tuesday. Earlier story: Ratings expectations for first Trump-Clinton debate are sky high Anticipation for the Clinton-Trump meeting had been mounting for months. Television industry executives were anticipating a total audience somewhere between 80 and 100 million. There will be two more debates between the candidates in October. On Monday night Twitter said the first face-off was the ""most tweeted debate ever."" Given the rapid growth of streaming options, it was almost certainly the most streamed debate ever, as well. Various live streams on YouTube together registered more than 2.5 million simultaneous viewers. Live streams on other sites also reached millions of people. On both Twitter and Facebook, Trump was a livelier subject than Clinton. Twitter said the ""final share of conversation around the candidates on stage"" was 62% for Trump and 38% for Clinton. On Facebook, the results were even more lopsided, with Trump earning 79% share of conversation and Clinton having the remaining 21%. Being talked about isn't necessarily a good thing for a candidate. Most commentators gave Clinton the edge over Trump after the debate. Still, the post-debate coverage on TV focused on Trump, partly because of surprising and confounding comments he made on stage. CNN's reality check team investigated 26 claims made by Clinton and Trump and found that Trump made a greater number of misleading statements.",0.011876485,0.002375297,0.002375297,0.011876485,0.023752969,0.201900238,0.0,2,-1,1
"We are absolutely heartbroken to hear about the death of someone that was so special to everyone in country music. She always had a smile on her face and she lit up any room that she walked into. Jean Shepard was 82 years old and after only a couple of days in hospice care we had to say our goodbyes. Jean Shepard was a Grand Ole Opry member and shewasn just any member. Shepard was known as the ?Grand Lady?. In 1955 she was inducted and in 2015 she was the only female that had ever been a member of the Opry for 60 years ? which is how she earned the name. The Grand Lady was also inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame a couple of years ago in 2011. She was passionate about country music, and loved what it stood for. Of course, like many older stars she felt like country music justisn the same as what it used to be. In one of her final interviews with Women Of Country at the Grand Ole Opry she told all. ?Sixty years ago, I loved what the Grand Ole Opry stood for,?I still love what it stands for, but not quite so much.Isn it terrible being so truthful?? The Grand Lady passed away from complications due toParkinson disease on September 25, 2016.Jean publicist shared about her life in a press release and we are heartbroken. ?Jean was born Ollie Imogene Shepard in Oklahoma and raised one of ten children in Visalia, California. At age 14 she was spotted by country star Hank Thompson singing and playing bass in the all-girl bandshe formed called the Melody Ranch Girls. Thompson brought her to the attention of Capitol Records and soon the trailblazing Shepard was setting the precedent in country music for a young woman recording and touring on her own rather than as a member of a family act, a duo, or aband ?girl singer.'? There is truly no one like Jean, and there never will be another Grand Lady. She was survived by her husband and her 3 sons. Please continue to pray for this family during their time of loss.

"Melbourne, Florida  Donald Trump declared himself the unquestionable winner of his first debate against Hillary Clinton during a rally Tuesday night, then relived the entire debate before a Florida crowd of supporters, this time with the help of a teleprompter -- and without Clinton baiting him. The Republican presidential nominee ticked down a list of issues he failed to sufficiently hammer Clinton on during their 90-minute bout -- from her foreign policy failures to her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. He also insisted on defending two factually incorrect statements he made the previous night. Trump touted unscientific, online post-debate polls as ""things of beauty."" He also again claimed to be ""holding back"" during the faceoff because he ""didn't want to do anything to embarrass"" Clinton. That comment came after blaming debate moderator Lester Holt of NBC News for being tough on him earlier in the day, ""For 90 minutes I watched her very carefully and I was also holding back. I didn't want to do anything that embarrassed her,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""For 90 minutes, she argued against change, while I called for dramatic change. We have to have dramatic change."" But while he spent much of the debate on the defense, Trump was free to unleash on Clinton without abandon as he rallied thousands of supporters Tuesday night in an airplane hangar. He slammed Clinton for having ""defended every major failure she helped create,"" placing particular emphasis on Clinton's track record as secretary of state. ""Iraq and Libya are in chaos,"" Trump said. ""Here in America we've seen one Islamic terror strike after another."" Trump pointed to Clinton's decades-old career in the political spotlight -- arguing she has not accomplished enough, and failed too often, in that time period. ""I kept saying for 26 years you've been doing nothing,"" Trump said. ""She's the candidate of yesterday. And ours is the campaign and we're the people of the future."" Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas and then the United States before she was elected for the first time to public office in 2000 as a US senator from New York. And while Clinton made it through the debate on Monday with relatively few attacks from Trump on the subject, on Tuesday, Trump attacked her over her email practices, including her false assertion she neither sent nor received information marked classified. ""Another Crooked Hillary lie,"" Trump said. ""Have you ever seen a greater embarrassment to our country?"" Clinton is ""an insider fighting only for her donors and insiders,"" Trump said, touting his outsider status. But Trump also entrenched himself on two issues the debate's moderator, Holt, called out on for being factually inaccurate. He insisted the stop-and-frisk practice used in New York City that a federal judge ruled unconstitutional in 2013 was constitutional. And he argued that he was ""against going into Iraq,"" even though he did not publicly oppose the war before it started, expressed support for it a month before Congress voted to approve military force and even praised the invasion as a ""tremendous success."" And earlier in the day, as the Clinton campaign sought to highlight disparaging comments Trump made about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, Trump reiterated his criticism. ""She gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem,"" he said on ""Fox and Friends."" Trump on Tuesday also returned to his characterization of the press as ""the most dishonest people I've ever dealt with"" and, as he continued to review the previous night's debate, suggested Clinton's success was tied to the ""mainstream media."" ""Without the mainstream media, folks, she wouldn't even be here. She wouldn't even have a chance,"" Trump said. But Trump also signaled that he and his campaign took note of his strongest moments in the debate. Trump hammered home his commitment to addressing trade imbalances Tuesday night and pointed to his back-and-forth with Clinton over trade, particularly when he called her out for calling the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal the ""gold standard"" of trade agreements. Clinton now opposes the TPP trade deal. ""The American people rendered their verdict. The post-debate polls as I said to you were so great, but we exposed Hillary Clinton's real position on NAFTA which was by the way the single worst deal as you'll ever see and Trans-Pacific Partnership -- another great disaster that she lied about,"" Trump said.",0.033333333,0.009259259,0.0074074069999999995,0.009259259,0.068518519,0.29444444399999997,0.0074074069999999995,2,-1,1
"With red lips, blue eyes and big blond hair, a former newscaster and lounge singer named Gennifer Flowers had talked to a supermarket tabloid about how she had been presidential candidate BillClinton mistress for 12 years. It was up to his wife to fix it. So on Sunday, January 26, 1992, on 60 Minutes on CBS, in a time slot immediately following the Super Bowl, Hillary Clinton responded fiercely to questions about herhusband reported infidelity and the nature of theirmarriage invoking the name of a country music star. ?You know,I not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette,? she said, wearing gold earrings and a black headband, perched next to him on a couch in a hotel suite in Boston and waving her clenched right hand. ?I?m sitting here because I love him, and I respect him, and I honor whathe been through and whatwe been through together. And you know, ifthat not enough for people, thenheck?t vote for him.? Story Continued Below This wasAmerica introduction to Hillary Clinton, and itworked her husband. What she did on 60 Minutes saved his candidacy and his political career. Most agree he would not have become president without it. For her, however, it came at a steep cost. In 10 minutes of television, she projected a set of complicated, even conflictingimages but defensive, feisty butdutiful the mix of skeptical, antagonistic feelings that have defined her with a share of the American public ever since. Now, as she gets closer to the presidency than any woman ever has, she is struggling with unfavorable ratings that would be historically high if itweren for heropponent being even higher. There are substantive reasons, as with any politician with a long public record, but underlying them are the same frictions that came to the fore in that 60 Minutesinterview that, fair or not, have grown only more pronounced withClinton perennial, awkward and generally unsuccessful efforts to re-introduce herself, to redefine herself. Itdidn have to be this way. Some of her key staffers from the ?92 campaign said in interviews with Politico that they feel deep, lasting regret about this legacy. There was so much to work with, theyexplained education reform, her advocacy for children, her role as a mother, as opposed to the harder, more threatening persona of an ambitious corporate attorney or do-anythingoperator yet ?there was little strategic thought given to how to present her to a broader audience,? according to Richard Mintz, her staff director during that campaign. This, he and others said, was because of time constraints, and because the Clinton bid early on was seen as a long shot, and because everybody was understandably more worried about how to package him, not her, and because staffers saw her as so intelligent and capable that itdidn dawn on them that she would need political help herself. In retrospect, though, there was one chance to help her make a first impression, they said. And they blew it. ?It?s one of the great regrets, seriously, of my life,? Mintz said. ?Certainly I feel like we could have done, and should have done, a better job. There is a lot of regret in me,? said Patti Solis Doyle, the veteran political strategist who was a young senior adviser to Hillary Clinton in that campaign. ?There was never any, ?Oh, Hillary could be a problem ?? There was, though, aproblem one thatwouldn be fully understood for years to come. Because of the dire circumstances under which she was forced to enter the national glare, the enduring paradox of Hillary Clinton was cemented before the Super Bowl champion Washington Redskins had flown home. The appearance on 60 Minutes amounted to a mandate to come off strong enough to help him but not so strong as to hurt him, an almost impossible balancing act. Even as she was putting up an effective unified front, she was presenting to an estimated 50 million viewers a tangle of contradictions. She wanted to show herindependence quality that ended up alienating a whole set of traditionalistvoters she was standing by herman decision that still today alienates younger people who see it as a kind of surrender. She had her own career, but she was also the ?wife of.? It was a continuation of the fundamental tension that had underscored her almost two decades living inArkansas now this knotty push-pull was laid bare in the harshest of national spotlights. That image of an assertive, outspoken woman was reinforced seven weeks later when on March 16, 1992, she responded to questions about the appearance of conflicts of interest between her work as a partner at one of the most prestigious law firms in Arkansas and herhusband position as the governor of the state by unleashing a headstrong remark many women found insulting. ?I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas,? Clinton snapped to reporters at a restaurant called the Busy Bee during a campaign stop in Chicago, ?but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life.? These two sound-bite snapshots and the time between turned Clinton into a Rorschach test through which people from coast to coast wrestled with awoman role at home, at work and in politics. She became a contentious issue in the coverage of the campaign, which led to a too-little, too-late effort to amend the approach and softenthe look of the highest-profile surrogate, which led to the initial round of discussion in the national media about who she reallywas and whether her marriage was true love or a calculating political partnership. Hillary and Bill Clinton on 60 Minutes in 1992. | Getty Here heading into the last month and a half of this mad, hinge-of-history election, and as Clinton prepares for another high-stakes TVmoment hotly anticipated first debate against DonaldTrump former staffers and longtime friendscan help but look back to the 60 Minutes interview and the comment about cookiesand teasand see the unmistakable roots of her penchant for stilted caution and thepublic implacable suspicions. ?Boy,? said Nancy Wanderer,who been friends with Clinton since they were classmates at Wellesley College. ?Two short little sentences that packed a lot of punch. ? I just said the other day, ?When did this business start, when people began to not like her, not trust her?? And I thinkit the 60 Minutes interview.? ?There was this way of seeing her in a certain light,? said Jan Piercy, another close friend from Wellesley, ?that shecouldn shake.? ?The great tragedy is that we lost the thread that was at her core,? said Mintz, her staff director. ?It?s probably one of the great political missed opportunities of all time.? *** He always needed her more than she needed him. ?Hillarydoesn have to stay with Bill Clinton,? her friend Linda Bloodworth-Thomason said in 1992. ?She could get to the Senate or possibly the White House on herown she knows it.? ?She had more choices than any woman in America,? her friend Susan Thomases said the same year. ?But she chose this and chose to make her life with him.? And the choice was forged from an essential compromise: A whip-smart, aggressive, Yale-prepared attorney, she had left behind opportunities in East Coast power cities and moved to rural, out-of-the-way Arkansas to marry one of the most promising political talents of her generation. Her almost two decades in the state spooled out as a series of assertions ofindependence health care reform, state education reform, helping to start the Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families and thestate first neonatal nursery, national recognition for her work as a lawyer, seats onboards also concessions. She did corporate law, whichwasn her passion, instead of children and family law, which was, because it allowed her to be a betterprovider make a salary three to four times what her husband made as the governor. She took off her glasses and put in contact lenses. She changed her hair. She changed her clothes. She changed her name. For her own career, she wanted to be Hillary Rodham. For herhusband career, she had to be Hillary Clinton. ?I think that people who are married to politicians are under a tremendous strain,? Clinton said back in 1979, in an interview on local TV weeks into her time as the wife of a governor, ?because unless you have a pretty strong sense of your own self-identity, it becomes very easy to be buffeted about by all the people who are around your husband.? ?She had to do this, she had to dothat she acquiesced,? said Ann Henry of Fayetteville,who been her friend for more than 40 years. ?Becausethat what they wanted her to do, OK?That what Arkansas wanted her to do!? ?I said, ?Hey, wait a minute, this is the woman that rose to the top at Wellesley, that was president of our college government, because we thought she was so competent and intelligent,?? Wanderer said. ?The person she was,? Wanderer said, ?wasn?t going to be acceptable down there. It was a huge sacrifice.? The sacrifices continued. The fall before the 60 Minutes interview, in a trip to Chicago shortly after her husband had announced his presidential candidacy, she spent a night with Piercy, another college friend. ?She said to me, ?You know,Bill been attorney general and governor, andwe been in the public eye for yearsnowthere somethingthat absolutely a different universe when you step into this running for the presidency,?? Piercy said. ?It really was a moment of stepping across a line, and it worried her.? From 1992: HillaryClinton Early Stumbles Two events introduced her to the nation, cementing an image of her in place in voters? minds. It is only with the benefit of hindsight, of course, that everybody agrees Bill Clintonwouldn have been president without what Hillary Clinton did on January 26, 1992. It took a second-place finish in the New Hampshire primary some three weeks later, after which he practically declared victory by dubbing himself ?the Comeback Kid.? It took a faltering economy. It took a vulnerable incumbent in George H.W. Bush. It took, in the end, a win in November that made him the 42nd president of the United States. Hehadn announced he was running until October of the previous year, and in those first few months, another former staffer said in an interview, ?the campaign leadership was focused on Bill Clinton and had not yet fully consideredHillary role.? But all of a sudden, with the eruption of the Flowers story, itcouldn have been more clear: ?We bet a whole campaign on a single interview,? communications director George Stephanopoulos would write in hismemoir Hillary Clinton, not Bill Clinton, was by far the most critical cog. ?We were under pressure from the stories that had been printed in the trash tabloid,? campaign chairman Mickey Kantor said in an interview. ?We thought the best person to address these, of anybody, was her.? As top strategist James Carville would say later: ?No her, no go.? ?Did she want to do that interview,? Doyle said. ?Abso-frickin?-lutely not. This was survival. She was going to fight. She was fighting for her husband, for herself, for their political careers.? So in the post-Super Bowl interview on CBS, Hillary Clinton used the phrase ?zone of privacy,? and he ?acknowledged wrongdoing? and ?causing pain in my marriage? but stopped short of an outright denial hecouldn give without lying. But what elicited what became the most unforgettable comment from either one of them was a question from 60 Minutes? Steve Kroft in which he expressed the notion that their marriage was ?an understanding,? ?an arrangement.? ?Wait a minute,? Bill Clinton said. ?You?re looking at two people who love each other. This is not an arrangement or an understanding. This is a marriage.? At which point Hillary Clinton piped up and said what she said about Tammy Wynette. ?I wish I had let him have the last word,? she would write a little more than a decade later. Still, at the time, what came across on the screen, at least to her friends all over the country, was ? authentically her. ?That was my friend,? said LittleRock Skip Rutherford, who watched at a Super Bowl party turned Clinton viewing. ?That was my friend Hillary.? *** She called Doyle the night it aired. ?She called me to ask how I thought it went,? Doyle said. ?I told her I thought she was really strong, really forceful, and appeared really committed to her husband and to her family.? Clinton thanked her. ?She was definitely pleased,? Doyle added. ?She was happy with it because she was truthful. She said what she had to say. I love this guy. I respect this guy. Very matter of fact.? And in many corners of the press, she was praised. The Economist called her ?sharp-tongued? and ?attractive.? ?Tough woman, this Hillary Clinton,? wrote a columnist for the Los Angeles Daily News. The TV critic at the Washington Post said Bill Clinton ?looked like a scared kid. Not a presidential image. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, appeared impressively impervious, suggesting perhaps that the wrong Clinton is running for office.? She was lauded even by a leading New Hampshire Republican. Said Tom Rath, then a George H.W. Bush appointee as a director of the Legal Services Corporation and now a POLITICO Insider, to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution the day after 60 Minutes: ?The big winner was Hillary Clinton. I thinkhe got a problem still.? But she also drew some fire from outside the pundit class. ?Tammy?s madder than hell,?Wynette fifth husband told USA Today. Wynette wrote a plainspoken open letter in which she actually cut right to the crux, demanding an apology and portraying the aspiring West Wing spouse as an elitist enabler riding herhusband coattails. ?I believe you have offended every person who has made it on their own with no one to take them to the White House,? the singer said. She challenged Clinton to ?stand toe to toe with me. I can assure you, in spite of your education, you will find me to be just as bright.? Told ofWynette reaction during a meeting with the editorial board of a small newspaper in Grand Junction, Colorado, Clinton rolled her eyes and slapped her forehead, according to an account from the Associated Press. ?Ididn mean to hurt Tammy Wynette as a person,? she said. ?I happen to be a country-western fan.? New Window OPTICS: Hillary's First Presidential Campaign | AP But Clintoncouldn find the right tone and stick with it. She seemed to vacillate between apologetic and apoplectic. She said sorry to Wynette, again, two nights later on national TV onABC PrimetimeLive a lengthy feature in which she also offered up a withering dismissal of Flowers, calling her a money-grubber, a fame-chaser, ?some failed cabaret singer whodoesn have much of a resume to fall back on.? And the world offered its critique. Even Richard Nixon weighed in. ?If the wife comes through as being too strong and too intelligent, it makes the husband look like a wimp,? the former president told the New York Times a week and a half after the 60 Minutes interview. Nixon cited Barbara Bush as the modelwife who has her own opinions butdoesn upstage her husband. By March, a new narrative had emerged. Said the Washington Post: ?Hillary Clinton, Trying to Have it All; Lawyer, Author, Activist, Strategist, Mother, Political Wife ? and Now, Political Problem?? Further complicating matters for her: the first story in the Times about the money-losing real estate deal in Northwest Arkansas that ultimately would metastasize into the Whitewater scandal and an article in the Post headlined, ?The Uncertain Intersection: Politics and Private Interests; HillaryClinton Law Firm is Influential With State.? Jerry Brown, the governor of California and an opponent in the presidential primaries, brought up the Post article in a debate, accusing Bill Clinton of funneling money to hiswifefirm false representation. He responded toBrown charge of corruptionby calling him a liar and saying he ?ought to be ashamed? for ?jumping on my wife.? The next day, the day before the Illinois and Michigan primaries, with stress mounting, reporters approached Hillary Clinton at the Busy Bee. ?Back then,? said Jim Cullinan, a staff aide doing her advance work, who was there, ?it was much more casual in terms of the press being close to her.? Out came the comment about cookiesand ?teas.? ?Exasperation,? said Piercy, her friend. ?Complete exasperation.? ?Just pure frustration,? said Jody Franklin, her chief of staff on that campaign. ?I think this countrywasn ready for a professional, strong, highly competent, feminist firstlady think the country was not ready for that, and the campaigndidn understand that,? Franklin said. ?And there she was, getting humiliated on 60 Minutes, savinghim then she gets shit for it. And then she gets shit for ? working, for simply having a job.? *** The Clinton brain trust knew immediately cookiesand teaswould be a big problem. ?As soon as I heard that,? Paul Begala, a chief strategist for the campaign, would say in 2000, ?I thought, ?People are going to take that out of context.They going to suggest shedoesn care about stay-at-home moms.? So I went up to her and I told her that. I pulled her aside, and I said, ?You know, Hillary,you got to go restate this. People are going to thinkthat an attack on stay-at-home moms.? And she had the most wounded andna look on her face. ? She had no idea that might be taken out of context. She said, ?No one could think that.? She said, ?I would have given anything to be a stay-at-home mom. My mother was a stay-at-home mom. I justdidn have a choice because Bill was making $35,000 a year and we needed to support the family.? I said, ?I know that.? And she said, ?Oh, you worry too much.? I mean, it was unimaginable to her that that would be a firestorm. I was certain it would be.? So outside, on the sidewalk in the cold, she tried to clean it up. ?The work thatI done as a professional,? she explained, ?as a public advocate, has been aimed in part to assure that women can make the choices that they shouldmakeit full-time career, full-time motherhood, some combination, depending upon what stage of life they are at.? Itdidn help. And there she was, getting humiliated on 60 Minutes, savinghim then she gets shit for it.? The next day, her husband won the primaries in Michigan and Illinois, closing in on the Democraticnomination headlines were about her. ?Hillary Clinton Law Career Brings Up Spouse Role Issue,? said the Los Angeles Times. ?Hillary Clinton is fair political game,? said the Chicago Tribune. ?Hillary Clinton defends herself,? said the Boston Globe. And on NBC, making a connection that would calcify from there, correspondent Lisa Myers tied cookiesand teasto 60 Minutes. ?HillaryClinton strong performance during the Gennifer Flowers episode helped save herhusband candidacy,? Myers reported. ?But now, she may be fast becoming an issue herself.? Times columnist William Safire gave it a name: ?The Hillary Problem.? Gloria Cabe, thecampaign congressional liaison and the manager of its office in Washington, worried that it had the potential to be ?fatal.? ?We got lots of phone calls,? Cabe later said. ?And it was apparent to me that not only were we hearing from traditional women who had chosen, for whatever reason, to stay at home with their children, but we were inundated with calls from professional women who felt it had insulted them, who had made the decision to take a few yearsoff many of them talked about baking cookies.? The campaign devised a courseshift sort of Hillary-specific strategy her advisers sayhadn totally existed up until thatpoint it happened quickly. ?Hillary Clinton,? Newsweek noticed in late March, two weeks post-Busy Bee, ?has clearly lowered her profile on the campaign trail.? Bill Clinton pulled back his ?buy one, get one free? stump-speech catchphrase, which had prompted talk of a kind of ?co-presidency,? and Hillary Clinton started talking less about policy and more about family. She agreed to participate in a cookie bake-off sponsored by Family Circle magazine. She agreed to an interview for a puffy People profile about their friends, family and faith. She got her hair styled. She took off her unfussy professional woman headband. In May, she gave the graduation speech at her alma mater, 23 years after she spoke at commencement as a student. ?As women today, you face tough choices,? she told the Wellesley College Class of 1992. ?You know the rules are basically as follows,? she said. ?If youdon get married,you abnormal. If you get married butdon have children,you a selfish yuppie. If you get married and have children, but work outside the home,you a bad mother. If you get married and have children, but stay home,you wasted your education. ?So you see,? she concluded, ?if you listen to all the people who make these rules, you might just conclude that the safest course of action is just to take your diploma and crawl under your bed.? So you see,? Hillary concluded, ?if you listen to all the people who make these rules, you might just conclude that the safest course of action is just to take your diploma and crawl under your bed.? Shedidn do that. But she did agree toadjustments latest in a sequence that had started with her acquiescences in Arkansas. ?My recollection is that after the convention,? said Franklin, her chief of staff, ?there was a very significant, purposeful shift in strategy.? It included appearances like a stop at a vocational school, Doyle remembered, to stage a photo-op of her getting her nails done by the cosmetology students. ?She was like, ReallyThis is whatI doing now??? ?After those situations??Tammy Wynette, cookiesand ?teas???the campaign ? decided to use her to rally the base, a broad Democratic base who adored her. But that was like putting her in a box,? Franklin said. ?She was put in a box for the rest of thecampaign it worked.? ?The political image makers are hard at it this year,? Tom Brokaw said on NBC News in early August, a few weeks after the convention. ?They worried that Hillary Clinton was coming off as too bright, too outspoken, too upfront. So, they asked her to warm it up a bit.? Itwasn lost oneverybody some in thepress her principal transgression actually seemed to be that she was a woman who said what she thought instead of quietly receding into the conventionally accepted political staging. ?Women who are not clearly submissive are seen as dominating and reviled for it. Women who do fit the images [of submissiveness] are not taken seriously. Like Hillary Clinton, you are damned if you do and damned if youdon.? Deborah Tannen ?Politicians in both parties like to say that this is the Year of the Woman,? correspondent Andrea Mitchell pointed out in her Brokaw-introduced report. ?But thatdoesn necessarily apply to thepolitician wife.? She compared the Hillary Clinton of the primaries with the Hillary Clinton of the general election. ?When the wives are introduced these days,? Mitchell said, referring to Hillary Clinton and running mate AlGore wife, Tipper, ?it?s to take a bow and step back.? ?Is she helping or hurting her husband?? asked the cover of Time Magazine on September 14, 1992. | TIME Throughout the summer and fall, a shorthand tag developed among newspapers, news magazines and the TV networks. ?The Hillary Factor,? they started calling it. ?Is She Helping or Hurting Her Husband,? Time asked on its cover in September. ?But the real Hillary Factor,? argued Deborah Tannen, then a fellow atStanford Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences, in an op-ed in October in the Times, ?is the double bind that affects all successful or accomplishedwomen, all women who do not fit stereotypical images of femininity: women who are not clearly submissive are seen as dominating and reviled for it. Women who do fit the images are not taken seriously. Like Hillary Clinton, you are damned if you do and damned if youdon.? *** That November, obviously, Bill Clintonwon his wife discovered that the tightrope she had walked in the 60 Minutes interview just kept going. She walked it as she took her place as a policy advisor with an office in the West Wing instead of the customary first lady quarters on the other side of the White House. She walked it as she led health carereform then stumbled, necessitating another recalibration, another ?softening.? She walked it in 1998 through the Monica Lewinsky scandal, returning to national TV to mount another defense of her husband that he ultimatelydidndeserve time on The Today Show on NBC, this time alone, this time talking not about Tammy Wynette but a ?vast right-wing conspiracy,? sparking echoes of 60 Minutes and bolstering the skepticism about their marriage, that it was mostly a union of political expedience. She walked the tightrope out of the White House, too, her eye on a political prize of herown she won. In the Senate, she walked it still, the world-famous former first lady who tried at the start to be head-down, back-bench anonymous, the aisle-crossing policy wonk who attempted to show a stern side with her vote to support the invasion of Iraq. And she walked it in 2007 and 2008, through her first presidential bid, beating Barack Obama in the New Hampshire primary only after she cracked just a tad at a campaign stop at anothereatery years after the BusyBee almost cried. ?Re-Re-Re-Reintroducing Hillary Clinton,? the New York Times Magazine headlined a story last summer at the outset of her current campaign. The ?issue of her political authenticity,? University of Maryland communications professor Shawn J. Parry-Giles wrote in her 2014 book Hillary Clinton in the News: Gender and Authenticity in American Politics, has been a preouccupationof the press that has doggedClinton ?from 1992 onward.? All thesequestions is she so stiff? Why is she so scripted? Why is she so cautious? Why is she so secretive??I think it all goes back to 1992.? ?Idon know that Mrs. Clinton has ever fully recovered from the difficulties of the early stages of that campaign,? said Russell Riley, a professor and co-chair of the University ofVirginia presidential oral history program. ?All thesequestions is she so stiff? Why is she so scripted? Why is she so cautious? Why is she so secretive??I think it all goes back to 1992,? said Tannen, now a professor of linguistics at Georgetown. That interview plus cookiesand ?teas,? said Wanderer, her friend from Wellesley, added up to ?an odd introduction, because I think both of those moments represented her trying to explain who she really is. But instead of saying what she actuallyis person dedicated to making positive changes to move the country forward in what you might call a progressiveway think she felt very defensive about it, like thiswasn going to be acceptable.?I not sitting here, some little woman ? I suppose I could have ? ?Is she guarded all the time?? Franklin, her chief of staff in that ?92 campaign, said this week. ?I think she is. And I understand why.? In both the 60 Minutes interview and the comment at the Busy Bee, Franklin said, ?she was herself, she said what she believed, and with personality. But it was misinterpreted. And she got screwed for it.? To Doyle, one ofClinton closest advisers throughout that campaign, it all started with the 60 Minutesinterview which, she said, there are two great truths. The first? ?He would not have been president had she not defended him, period, end of story.? And the second? ?There was no way for her to win in that situation, no way for her to win there, as a woman.?

"Story highlights The Oversight Committee approved the GOP-led contempt resolution last week Pagliano's lawyers last week accused Chaffetz of launching a witch hunt Washington (CNN) House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters the House will vote this week on a resolution holding Bryan Pagliano, the former Hillary Clinton aide who helped set up her private email server, in contempt of Congress. House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz tweeted that he filed a resolution Tuesday. The Oversight Committee approved the GOP-led contempt resolution last week along a straight party line. The floor vote is expected to come Thursday or Friday, according to a senior House GOP leadership aide. Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, has argued that previous testimony from another one of Clinton's IT workers, Justin Cooper, made it imperative for Pagliano to testify. ""I explained Mr. Pagliano was uniquely qualified to provide testimony to help the committee better understand Secretary Clinton's use of a private email server. This is indisputable,"" Chaffetz said. ""I also made clear the committee would consider all options regarding Mr. Pagliano's failure to appear, including consideration of recommending he be held in contempt.""

"You?d think that putting together a list of the 8 worst mass murderers in American history would be a straightforward task. Unfortunately,it not, because there are quite a few ?mass murders? that most Americansdon consider to fit the definition. For example, most peoplewouldn look at the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Tulsa Race Riot, or 80 Branch Davidians dying when BillClinton Department of Justice moved in on them to be ?mass murders.? So, as a definition,we talking about large killings on American soil, perpetrated by a single person or small group of people. What follows are the 7 worst mass murderers in American history. 8. Adam Lanza Location: Newtown, Connecticut Nickname: Sandy Hook Massacre Year: 2012 Method: Semi-automatic rifle, semi-automatic pistol Deaths: 27 Adam Lanza had Asperger's syndrome and was anorexic and mentally ill; he became increasingly isolated and dysfunctional. OnLanza 20th birthday, he shot his mother four times in the head with one of her guns while she slept. Then he drove her car to the Sandy Hook Elementary School where he killed 20 children between the ages of 5 and 10, along with 6 adults. After he finished his murderous rampage, Lanza shot himself in the head and died on the scene. 7. Seung-Hui Cho Image Credit: Wikipedia Image Credit: Wikipedia Location: Blacksburg, Virginia Nickname: Virginia Tech Massacre Year: 2007 Method: Two semi-automatic pistols Deaths: 32 Cho was born in South Korea, but was a legal resident of the United States. He had depression and anxiety problems and seemed to have extreme difficulty talking with people. As with Adam Lanza, some of his teachers were alarmed at the violent stories he wrote. In fact one of them, Lucinda Roy, said she was concerned for her safety when she met with him one on one and said she reported him to school authorities. Unfortunately, nothing was done. Cho spent months planning the attack, but it began in a bizarre fashion. Cho murdered Emily Jane Hilscher in her dorm room along with Ryan Clark, who apparently tried to help her. There has been some speculation that Cho had a crush on her, but theredoesn seem to be definitive proof of that. After killing both of them, Cho managed to escape back to his dorm room without being detected. There he mailed an angry, rambling manifesto to NBC. Two and a half hours after the first killings, Cho went to another building on campus and killed an additional 25 students and 5 teachers. Afterwards, Cho committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. 6. Name Unknown Image Courtesy of Wikipedia Image Courtesy of Wikipedia Location: New York, New York Nickname: Wall Street Bombing Year: 1920 Method: Dynamite (bomb) Deaths: 38 In 1920, a horse-drawn carriage filled with 100 pounds of dynamite and 500 pounds of iron was parked outside the J.P. Morgan Bank in New York City. The bomb killed 38 people and wounded another 143. There was speculation that communists or anarchists were behind the bombing, but unfortunately, the perpetrator was never caught. 5. Marshall Applewhite Location: Rancho Santa Fe, California Nickname:Heaven Gate Suicide Year: 1997 Method: Persuasion/suffocation Deaths: 38 Marshall Applewhite was the gay leader of theHeaven Gate Cult. Applewhite, who had such a hold over his followers that he convinced six of them to join him in being CASTRATED, told the cult members that they had to kill themselves in order to hitch a ride on a UFO hiding behind the Hale-Bopp comet. Over a THREE DAY LONG PERIOD, the cult members, including Marshall Applewhite, took phenobarbital and vodka, then put plastic bags over their heads and suffocated to death. 4. Andrew Philip Kehoe Image Credit Wikipedia Image Credit Wikipedia Location: Bath Township, Michigan Nickname: Bath School Disaster Year: 1927 Method: Dynamite/Pyrotol (bomb) Deaths: 44 Kehoe was the elected treasurer of the Bath Consolidated School Board and was temporarily appointed as the Bath Township clerk. After losing an election for the position, Kehoe, who was also deep in debt, stopped maintaining his farm. Soon thereafter, his farm went into foreclosure. Adding to the pressure on Kehoe, his wife was ill with tuberculosis. Yet and still, Kehoedidn simply ?snap.? He used his position as theschool volunteer handyman to his advantage. It allowed him to spend MONTHS planting explosives near the Bath school. Kehoe started by murdering his own wife and then set his farm on fire. From there, Kehoe went to the school and set off the explosiveshe planted. Thirty seven children, most of whom were between the ages of 6 and 8, died in the explosions. However, Kehoewasn done yet. After rescue efforts began, Kehoe drove up to a group including the school superintendent and detonated his truck, which was filled with dynamite. Kehoe and 6 victims died in the blast. When his farm was searched afterward, a sign with the words ?Criminals Are Made, Not Born? was found. 3. Omar Mateen Image Credit Wikipedia Image Credit Wikipedia Location: Orlando, Florida Nickname: Orlando nightclub shooting Year: 2016 Method: Semi-automatic rifle, Semi-automatic pistol Deaths: 49 Omar Mateen was a radical Muslim whose father supported the Taliban.Mateen wife knew the attacks were coming and even helped him scope out the Pulse nightclub. Former classmates remembered Mateen cheering the 9/11 attacks. There was rampant speculation that Mateen was actually gay and taking revenge for being rejected by men in the club, but FBI sources have commented thatthey found no evidence that Mateen was ?secretly gay.? At 2:00 a.m., Mateen walked into the gay Pulse nightclub in Orlando and started shooting. By the time he was done, 49 people were dead. During his rampage, Mateen called 911 and News 13 of Orlando in order to let people know he was pledging allegiance to ISIS. After the police arrived, Mateen took hostages. Eventually, SWAT stormed the building and Mateen was shot eight times and killed. 2. Stephen Paddock (Suspect) Location: Mandalay Bay Resort, Las Vegas, Nevada Year: 2017 Method: Reportedly an Automatic Weapon Deaths: 58+ More than 50 people were killed and more than 500 injured when Stephen Paddock began firing on a country music concert from his hotel room at the Mandalay Bay resort in Las Vegas. 1. Timothy McVeigh Image Credit Wikipedia/Olaf Growald Image Credit Wikipedia/Olaf Growald Location: Oklahoma City Nickname: Oklahoma City Bombing Year: 1995 Method: Ammonium Nitrate (bomb) Deaths: 168 On April 19, 1995, which was the 2nd anniversary of the end of the Branch Davidian siege, a truck bomb was parked under the day care center in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. It contained more than 4000 pounds of ammonium nitrate and the explosion was enormous with 324 nearby buildings damaged or destroyed while 168 people died and 680 were injured. Within an hour and a half of the bombing, Timothy McVeigh, the man who had driven the truck, was picked up on a traffic stop and quickly linked to the bombing. After searching the house ofMcVeigh father, evidence led the FBI to his co-conspirator, Terry Nichols. Nichols turned himself in. At the trial, it was revealed that Lori Fortier knew about the bombing, but did nothing to warn anyone. Her husband Michael actually helped scout the location. Timothy McVeigh was a militia member who was angry about government abuses in Waco and at Ruby Ridge and took his revenge with the bombing. In May of 2001, McVeigh was put to death by lethal injection. Nichols is still serving 161 life sentences. Michael Fortier, who testified against McVeigh and Nichols in return for leniency for his wife and a reduced sentence, served 10 1/2 years while his wife was given immunity.",0.011316872,0.004115226,0.00308642,0.00308642,0.019547325,0.212962963,0.005144033,-1,-1,1

"In the chaos and fog of a brutal conflict that has claimed an estimated 400,000 to 500,000 lives, a ragtag group of former bakers, tailors, salespeople, teachers, pharmacists, painters, carpenters and students has emerged as real-life heroes, providing a glimmer of hope in Syria's brutal five-year-old civil war. Interested in Syria? Add Syria as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Syria news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest The Syria Civil Defense group, otherwise known as the White Helmets, get their inspiration from an oft-quoted verse of the Quran: ""to save a life is to save all of humanity."" So far, the group of about 3,000 White Helmets have performed that feat some 60,000 times, often working in perilous conditions surrounded by violent conflict. On Thursday, the group won the Right Livelihood Award, often described as the ""Alternative Nobel."" The group has also been nominated for the Nobel Peace prize, with the support of over 133 organizations worldwide so far. Their job may be the most dangerous in the world. Comprised of unpaid volunteers using whatever supplies they can get their hands on, the White Helmets often place their own lives at risk, venturing into active battle zones to assist the sick and wounded. ""We go to save as many people as we can,"" says White Helmet Khaled Farah. If one person was alive, that's enough for us to take the risk."" So far, some 132 White Helmet volunteers have been killed in the line of duty, the majority from so-called ""double-tap"" strikes, where warplanes will drop a second bomb in the same spot of an initial strike as people rush in to aid the wounded and remove the dead. ""I help civilians every day, knowing that this will give my daughter and my country a better future,"" says another White Helmet, known simply as Fatima. Their motto is ""Humanity, Solidarity, Impartiality,? and the group says it services some seven million people in vulnerable areas of the country, some of which have been racked by unremitting violence. When not conducting rescue missions, the volunteers teach children and adults on safety measures to take during aerial attacks, help provide first aid and medical services, assist in the the evacuation of civilian populations from active conflict zones and help re-establish critical infrastructure like water and electricity. On Friday, The Associated Press reported that at least two civil defense centers were targeted in a renewed bombing campaign just days after a ceasefire backed by the U.S. and Russia unraveled. More than 13 million people require humanitarian assistance of some kind across Syria. Some 6 million people have been forced from their homes in the country ? nearly 1 million of them in the past six months alone. Of particular concern are the nearly 600,000 Syrians the United Nations estimates are living in besieged areas, cut off from regular access to basic necessities and living with the daily threat of deadly violence.",0.016438356,0.008219178,0.005479451999999999,0.01369863,0.02739726,0.309589041,0.0027397259999999996,2,-1,1
"Story highlights The turn of events was somewhat unexpected Leaders in each party had signaled for days they were close to a deal Washington (CNN) Eight days before a critical deadline, congressional negotiations over government funding stalled Thursday, prompting Senate Republicans to force a vote on a bill that Democrats warned they would reject. The GOP gambit came after months of talks between the two parties and raises doubts about the ability of Congress to pass a bill before the September 30 deadline, when the government could shut down. Frustrated by the lack of progress, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, went to the Senate floor and announced the GOP would drop several thorny issues -- known as ""riders"" -- that still need to be resolved. The tactic was designed to pressure Democrats to accept what McConnell called a ""clean"" government funding bill. ""There have been broad requests for a clean continuing resolution. So that's what I've just offered. It's the result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle,"" McConnell said when he filed the GOP bill. ""It's a fair proposal that funds all current government operations through December 9."" The GOP proposal was immediately panned by Democrats because it left out funds for Flint, Michigan, where the drinking water supply was poisoned by lead in the past year.

Moderated byNBC Lester Holt, the debate will take place at LongIsland Hofstra University. The format will be a 90-minute program without commercial breaks. Personally, I have to admit that Ican wait to see the real estate magnate and the former secretary of state engage in a verbal boxing match. Apparently, I am not alone. The first Trump-Clinton face off is anticipated by experts to draw ?as many as 100 million viewers ? reaching almost as many people as the Super Bowl.? BarackObama first debate with Mitt Romney in 2012, garnered over 70 million viewers, which was the highest number for a debate since 1980 when 80.6 million viewers tuned in to watch President Jimmy Carter debate Republican presidential candidate, Ronald Reagan. The reasons for the unprecedented interest are apparent. The 2016 presidential race has been patently different from any presidential campaign in recent history. First of all, the race is incredibly close. Clinton only has an aggregate lead of 3 points over Trump in the national race. However, Trump currently has the lead in several battleground states including Florida, North Carolina and Ohio. On the most basic level, the two candidates who have been called everything from the ?most polarizing? to the ?least-liked? candidates in history are also the most interesting. In the Democratic corner, you have Hillary Clinton, the woman who has spent most of her adult life in politics and arguably has been aspiring to the presidency for over 20 years. You only have to read her college thesis to see that the seeds of her ambition were already germinating on the Wellesley campus. Obviously, Clinton also brings to the arena not only her past history as a former first lady, former senator and former secretary of state, she also brings a suite of scandals involving her use of an unsecured email server during her tenure at the State Department, quid for quo dealings involving the Clinton Foundation etc. In the Republican corner, you have Donald Trump, a real estate billionaire whose last name has graced everything from hotels to ties. Trump also deepened his fame by becoming a reality show creator and star with his now legendary show ?The Apprentice.? One could argue that being a reality star was the perfect training ground for diving into the fishbowl called politics. Thedebate anticipated high ratings are also predicated on the assumption that everyone wants to witness the dynamics between Clinton and Trump in a one on one conversation format. We have heard a lot about their different styles of debate preparation. Supposedly, Trump has been studying videos of Clinton to better understand her body language and facial gestures. Clinton has been reportedly using her long time aide Philippe Reines as the Trumpstand-in during mock debate sessions. It will be interesting to see what happens when these two individuals who have been spending the last few months attacking each other indirectly via media interviews, campaign rallies and tweets actually get into the same room. When was the last time that happened? January 22, 2005, the day of DonaldTrump marriage to Melania Knauss? Yes,that right Bill and Hill were guests at theDonald third nuptial ceremony. Over the last few weeks, there has been a lot of speculation about Mrs.Clinton health and whether she is physically capable of serving as president. Her recent fainting episode at the 15th anniversary of the September 11thattacks (which has been since explained as a reaction to pneumonia) has been feeding the ?bad health? rumors which have been circulating since her 2012 concussion. Most recently, the speculation has deepened with theories covering everything from Parkinsons to a neurological problem. It has not helped the situation that Mrs. Clinton has also had public instances where she appeared physically unstable or in need of assistance mounting stairs. And of course, most recently a video has circulated of Mrs. Clinton addressing a largely union audience where she asked the rhetorical question of why sheisn 50 points ahead of Donald Trump in the race. More than one pundit has described her demeanor in this video as ?unhinged.? As for Mr. Trump, critics point to situations where he spoke bluntly such as saying that we need to bar all Muslims from entering the United States until we have a mechanism for vetting them. He also famously received a lot of criticism for his early remarks that some of the Mexicans entering the United States illegally are ?rapists and drug dealers.? Many viewers may tune in to see if Trump will put his foot in his mouth. Many will approach the debate with this perspective despite the fact that for the last two months Trump has been vigorously campaigning, delivering one policy speech after another while staying very much on message. Of course, the whole point of a presidential debate is for the candidates to have an opportunity to showcase their platforms to the American people. Obviously, their ability to effectively answer themoderator questions within the confines of a designated time frame and other guidelines are part and parcel of the debate. While viewers may be intrigued by the spectacle, they are also interested in hearing more about the issues. While we have heard a lot aboutTrump policies, we have not heard as much aboutClinton. Although, this week we did hear that she plans to impose a 65% estate tax on the wealthiest individuals. I am sure people may want to hear more about that. Also, media bias has played a huge role in the campaign. Many people may be tuning to see if Lester Holt will be a fair moderator. Of course, the primary reason people are tuning in to the debate is that the winner of the debate may very well become the winner of the election for the US presidency. After all, the race is all about who has the best vision, the best plan and the likelihood of ultimately delivering the best results for the American people.

"""He's like the Babe Ruth of debating. He really shows up and swings and does a great job,? Kellyanne Conway said of Donald Trump. | AP Photo Conway calls Trump 'the Babe Ruth of debating' On the eve of the first presidential debate, DonaldTrump campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, described her candidate Sunday as ?the Babe Ruth of debating,? a glowing assessmentthat unusual at a time when both camps typically work to rein in expectations. ?He's a brilliant debater,? Conway said onABC ?This Week.? ?Newt Gingrich put it best. The former speaker recently said Donald Trump is the best debater he's ever seen. He's like the Babe Ruth of debating. He really shows up and swings and does a great job.? Story Continued Below Trump has complained that the moderators of the debates may be unfair to him. But Conway saidshe not troubled by any of them, including Mondaynight moderator, NBC's Lester Holt. ?He's certainly going to be a good debate moderator tomorrow in that I trust that all of these moderators ? for all the debates, including the VP debate next week, will be asking questions that benefit the voter,? she said. And Conway threw cold water on the notion that Gennifer Flowers ? who claimed a 12-year affair with Bill Clinton before his presidential bid ? would be invited by the campaign to take a front-row seat, a suggestion Trump made on Twitter in response to the Hillary Clintoncamp invitation of Mark Cuban, a billionaire Trump antagonist. (Flowers told reporters that she would attend the debate.) ?She has not been invited by the campaign. She has a right to be there if somebody else gives her a ticket,? Conway said. ?But you know, I do think also it shows the poor judgment, a lack of nimbleness of the Clinton campaign that they actually put a statement out last night about Gennifer Flowers being invited, that it shows how easily provoked Donald Trump is, no, you just put out a statement and reminded people who had no ? taught people who had no idea who Gennifer Flowers is, that she's the woman who had ? said she had a 12-year affair with your husband when he was governor.? Asked why Trump suggested he may invite Flowers, Conway said, ?Because he wants to remind people that he's a great counterpuncher.? ?They started this one by saying that they would give a front-row seat to Mark Cuban,? she said. GOP vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence, in an interview on ""Fox News Sunday,"" also said Flowers would not be attending the debate.",0.053291535999999994,0.006269591999999999,0.0,0.028213166,0.090909091,0.238244514,0.0,2,-1,1
"Donald Trump is a creature of television. And as a creature of television, he holds strong opinions about what ought to happen when he steps in front of the cameras. For the 2016 presidential debates,he weighed in with a variety of programming suggestions: A debate schedule that does not conflict with NFL games. Different moderators. Or no moderators at all: ?I think that maybe we should just have no moderator. Let Hillary and I sit there and just debate,? he mused onCNBC Squawkboxearlier this month. Radical and unlikely as this last idea may seem, it also raises a fascinating question: Why have moderators at all? Whydon we have debates where candidates just face off, one-on-one, without any questioners? Such a format could be a radical but useful break from the classic debate structures that have undergirded 50-plus years of presidential history. Story Continued Below Format shapes the outcome of debates far more than we realize. Some formats are relatively simple for candidates to maneuver, allowing strong candidates to game the system; others keep them more under control? Debates are certainly not ?rigged,? but a standard two-podium format typically favors a very information-dense candidate like Hillary Clinton, while a town-hall format gives much more room for a big personality, like Trump, to dominate. For voters, too, different formats provide different kinds of information, from character to geniality to areas of expertise. The format Monday night is an extremely open one, borrowed from an idea debuted in 2012. Even without heedingTrump recommendation, the rules of engagement for thisyear presidential debates grant the candidates the power to conduct an essentially moderator-less exchange if they really want, allowing one or the other to grab the reins and seize control. On the one hand, this format would seem to benefit a loose performer like Trump, who is fully at home in the rough-and-tumble of live TV. On the other, long open exchanges could give Clinton a showcase to demonstrate her superior knowledge of policy and government. It might seem like a play for advantage, butTrump proposal for a debate without moderators is merely the latest entry in a long-running political conversation that has been underway since Lincoln met Douglas: what is the best way to design and execute a live campaign debate?It a surprisingly unsettled question after all theseyears might be poised for some radical changes. *** As both campaigns prepare for the showdown on Monday night, they should study the first debate from 2012, when Mitt Romney handed Barack Obama the most conclusive drubbing in a presidential debate since Richard Nixon sweated his way to defeat in 1960. The 2012 debates featured an innovation which, at the time, went nearly unremarked-upon in the press: long, open-ended discussion periods that, in effect, left it to the candidates to decide how the dialogue would unfold. Romney prepared specifically for these ground rules and took full advantage on debate night; Obama did not. And though much criticism was directed at moderator Jim Lehrer for approaching his task too passively, in fact, it wasObama rigidity in a malleable format that produced such a lopsided result. This exact same format will be used on Monday, as well as in the third debate, on October 19. Clinton and Trump will square off in six thematic blocks of 15 minutes apiece on subjects announced by the moderator in advance: This year, the topics will include ?America?s Direction,? ?Achieving Prosperity? and ?Securing America.? Although the moderator is responsible for introducing topics and ensuring a more or less equal distribution of time, the debaters themselves determine how those 15-minute segments play out. As far back as 1960, debate producers had hoped to install a format that emphasized direct exchange between Kennedy andNixon so-called Oxford-styledebate campaign handlers vetoed the idea. What happened instead was three decades of a fairly rigid, controlled formula that often reduced the debatesto parallel news conferences. ?The panel's role was hardly more than to designatecategories, vegetable, ormineral which the two might or might not discourse,? complained one Kennedy-Nixon panelist afterward. Despite the limitations of journalistic panels, the format endured because it imbued the candidates with a sense ofsecurity kept them from having to confront each other directly. The first Carter-Ford debate in 1976, for instance, contained virtually no cross-talk by the candidates, who addressed each other only by talking to the moderators. Although change has come slowly to presidential debates, it has come. In 1988, for instance, moderators for the first time were allowed to ask an opening question. Everyone remembers BernardShaw hardball opening question to Michael Dukakis (?If Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered??), but Shaw had a similarly gruesome set-up for George H.W. Bush (?If you are elected and die before Inauguration Day??). The introduction of town hall debates in 1992 wrought a wholly new format, one that has bedeviled candidates ever since. The town hall can generate positiveresults in 1992 and2004 it can be dull and un-insightful?as in 1996 and 2008. It can also encourage candidate aggression, as in the 2012 match between Obama and Romney. Whatever the outcome, town hall is probably the least comfortable format for politicians because it is nearly impossible to game in advance. For that reason, campaign negotiators have imposed increasingly burdensome restrictions over the years on how the town hall functions. The once-freewheeling format of 1992 has been reined in considerably, in the vain hope of protecting the participants. The 1990s also marked the debut of solo moderators in place of panels, giving individual journalists an outsized role in setting the debate agenda. Jim Lehrer filled that slot for every presidential debate in 1996 and 2000; since 2004, each debate has been helmed by a different moderator. Another recent format innovation is the table debate, in which candidates and moderator sit at a table instead of standing at lecterns. Table debates can be more conversational than the more formal setup of lectern debates. Furthermore, by placing the debaters in close proximity, table debatesencourage least intheory more civilized level of discourse. For Dick Cheney, table debates were also a practical necessity: withCheney history of heart problems, his advisers did not want to risk having him stand for 90 minutes. Whatwe going to see on Monday will be dramatic and is widely expected to be the most-watched debate in Americanhistory the format itself will be part of the reason why. Two drastically different personalities will, essentially, have six free-for-all segments to go at each other. The more polarized the electorate, the more valuable this kind of formatis diminishes the role of moderators and panels, who voters increasingly distrust, and gives the candidates the opportunity to guide the conversation. Similar formats have been successful in countries like France andSpain the U.S., too. During the 1992 Democratic primaries, Bill Clinton and Jerry Brown appeared on an episode of Donahue in which host Phil Donahue did little more than introduce his guests and let them have at it; the result was a fascinating and unpredictable hour of television. We should be so lucky to have a similar debate on Monday night. *** In the elections to come, strange new debate experiments are in the offing. Producers of primary debates have experimented with the use of crowd-sourced topics, including questions submitted as YouTube videos or via Twitter. This past summer, party leaders in Australia held one of their national debates not on broadcast and cable TV but on Facebook Live. Technological advances promise to inject new life into what many critics see as a sclerotic institution. At their best, these innovations might hold candidates accountable by tapping into real-time voter reactions and concerns. At worst, an excess of experimentation might reduce presidential debates to high-stakes video games. One novel proposal comes from New America senior fellow Lee Drutman, who suggests that we ought to end debates as we know them, and replace them with a crisis-situation simulator: ?Film crews could record the entire simulation, then television producers could turn it into a reality-TV special.? Perhaps the candidates can be administered the kobayashi maru; that, too, would receive high ratings. Still, without any of that high-tech sizzle, Monday night will be must-see TV for any voting-age American. It will simply be two candidates on a stage with one moderator, but likely to be more freewheeling thanwe imagine.

" While the media was busy talking about the NYC bombings and the arrest of Ahmad Khan Rahami, there was another bomb threat in Houston, Texas that did not receive nearly the same media attention. LA Times reporter Matt Pierce felt the incident was doomed from the start, and took to Twitter to imply that this story was pretty much guaranteed to not receive as much attention as the NYC bombings because of the skin color of the criminal involved. According to a news release from U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson, Houston man Cary Lee Ogborn was arrested last Friday after he was discovered to be at the center of a bomb plot targeting Houston, Texas. The statement from the U.S. Attorney specified that, ?Cary Lee Ogborn is charged with attempting to transport explosives with the intent that those explosives be used to kill, injure, or intimidate any individual or to damage or destroy a vehicle or building. He was arrested late Friday after picking up a package he believed contained such explosives.? AlthoughOgborn plan to attack Houston was thwarted before it could cause a tragedy, MattPearce tweet struck a chord with many people who are disappointed the media is more likely to push a story when it advances a criminal narrative that fits a profitable ?news-worthy formula? usually including Islamic terrorism or black and latino criminality. Despite the high-profile coverage of several attacks committed by Islamic terrorists, the numbers just do not reflect this narrative. Research from Gallup and the Triangle Center On Homeland and Security found that ?Law enforcement agencies in the United States consider anti-government violent extremists, not radicalized Muslims, to be the most severe threat of political violence that they face? due to the fact that ?Muslim-American terrorist suspects and perpetrators in the decade since 9/11, [represent] just a small percentage of the thousands of acts of violence that occur in the United States each year.?

""After further discussion with community leaders, we have decided to postpone Sunday's trip as not to impact the City's resources,"" Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri wrote in a statement. ""She will plan to visit Charlotte next Sunday, provided circumstances allow."" Story Continued Below The rescheduling comes after Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts made a public plea to Clinton and Donald Trump to delay any campaign trips to the city in light of their ""very stressed resources."" Clinton's campaign had announced the trip earlier Friday. Palmieri added: ""Her prayers are with the people of Charlotte during these difficult times."" Donald Trump wasted no time in responding to Clinton's reversal on social media, accusing his opponent of trying to ""grandstand"" and calling her initial decision to go to Charlotte ""dumb."" ""Crooked Hillary's bad judgement forced her to announce that she would go to Charlotte on Saturday to grandstand. Dem pols said no way, dumb!"" the Republican nominee tweeted late Friday. Trump was reportedly considering traveling to Charlotte next week following the presidential debate Monday, but has not elaborated on those plans. He incorrectly identified Clinton's initial trip as scheduled for Saturday. Protests have erupted in Charlotte since Keith Lamont Scott was shot dead by police Tuesday afternoon. The outcry over yet another officer-involved killing of a black person, days after an officer in Tulsa, Oklahoma, shot and killed Terence Crutcher, who was unarmed and had his hands up when he was fatally struck, turned violent late Wednesday into Thursday morning, prompting North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory to issue a state of emergency. Earlier Friday, the Democratic presidential nominee called on police to release the video of the shooting ? afterScott family had released its own cellphone video recorded byScott wife, Rakeyia Scott. ?Charlotte should release police video of the Keith Lamont Scott shooting without delay.

"Cities across the country suffered an uptick in violent crime last year, including a nearly 11 percent jump in murders from the year before, according to new statistics compiled by the FBI. There were 1,197,704 violent crimes committed around the nation last year -- a 3.9 percent increase from 2014, according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Report. However, last year's statistics were still slightly lower than in 2011, and more than 16 percent below the 2006 level, the FBI said today. It's important to note that big jumps in violent crime in only a handful of U.S. cities can drive the national average up. Some cities, like Chicago and Los Angeles, saw more than 24,000 violent crimes each last year, while so many other cities and towns across the country experienced single-digit or no violent crimes at all. Overall, murders accounted for nearly 15,700 of last year's violent crimes, and nearly three-quarters of them were committed with firearms, according to the FBI report. ""The report shows that there was an overall increase in violent crime last year, making clear what each of us already knows: that we still have so much work to do,"" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said at a violent-reduction summit in Little Rock, Arkansas. ""But the report also reminds us of the progress that we are making. It shows that in many communities, crime has remained stable or even decreased from the historic lows reported in 2014. And it is important to remember that while crime did increase overall last year, 2015 still represented the third-lowest year for violent crime in the past two decades."" Lynch said the nation must not become ""complacent"" about violent crime. ""The residents of communities where violence remains a fact of daily life care little whether overall crime rates are up and down,"" she said. ""And in the raft of data and analysis that can so often define our work, we must never forget that all of our numbers reflect the lives of real people."" She emphasized that ""there is no single cause of violence, and solutions will vary from one community to another.""",0.038910506,0.015564202,0.007782101,0.007782101,0.058365759,0.342412451,0.0,2,-1,1
" Secretary of State John Kerry launched a blistering attack on Russia Wednesday for its actions in Syria, pointing to the bombing of a UN aid convoy that left more than 20 dead and its inability to stop continued Syrian air attacks. Kerry spoke immediately after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at a United Nations Security Council meeting in New York about the five-year Syrian war. ""I listened to my colleague from Russia and I sort of felt like we're in a parallel universe here,"" Kerry said of their differing accounts of the conflict. He called for all planes in key areas of Syria to be immediately grounded and for countries to stop supporting those who sabotage ceasefire efforts. Kerry also questioned how the US-supported opposition can engage in political talks to resolve the conflict when the Syrian regime, backed by Russia, doesn't halt its attacks. Russia was tasked with restraining Syria during this latest attempt at a ceasefire, undertaken last week. ""How can people go sit at a table with a regime that bombs hospitals and drops chlorine gas again and again and again and again and again and acts with impunity,"" Kerry asked. ""You're supposed to sit there and have happy talk in Geneva while the regime drops bombs?"" Russian denial The diplomatic clashing of swords highlights just how hard it has been to take even the first steps toward calming the Syrian conflict enough to begin political talks. The ongoing civil war has given terror groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda fertile recruiting ground, has sucked in regional powers seeking influence over the outcome and has sent ripples through Europe and its allies. JUST WATCHED Aid convoy attacked in Syria Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Aid convoy attacked in Syria 02:45 As diplomats sparred at the Security Council, Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu said that Moscow was sending an aircraft cruiser to the Mediterranean to strengthen its capabilities there. The Russians have denied that they were behind the attack on the UN convoy and instead have offered a series of explanations that Kerry detailed at the Security Council meeting.. Russia initially said that the strike was a necessary response to an alleged offensive by an al-Qaeda-linked terror group, Kerry said. Then Russia claimed they were bombing elsewhere, then that the aid convoy had been followed by militants with mortars, and then that the trucks caught fire. ""The trucks and the food and the medicine just spontaneously combusted,"" Kerry said. ""Anybody here believe that?"" he asked. The bombing attacks on hospitals and children are ""flagrant violations of international law,"" he added. And attacks on civilians and humanitarian workers continue, Kerry noted. He cited separate air strikes on Monday that killed four aid workers near Aleppo. ""There are only two countries that have planes that are flying during the night or flying in that particular area at all,"" Kerry said. ""They are Russia and Syria."" 'Thorough and impartial' investigation At the Security Council Wednesday, Lavrov said Russia always put as a top priority the resumption of the inter-Syrian political dialogue without any preconditions. And he called for a ""thorough and impartial"" investigation into Monday's bombing, which left the convoy of trucks in a twisted wreck of smoking metal. And he urged his counterparts at the meeting to ""refrain from emotional comments."" US officials have fingered Russia as the perpetrator of the attack based on intelligence and reports from the ground. Kerry cited eyewitnesses who said that ""all of a sudden, the place became hell and the fighter jets were in the sky."" The White House said publicly Tuesday night that it held Russians responsible, regardless of whether it or the Syrian government had launched the strikes, since they have responsibility for the airspace. ""We have not seen good faith. This was an outrageous action,"" said Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes. Syrian Ambassador to the UN Bashaar Jaafari hit back, saying it was ""laughable"" for Kerry to cite eyewitness accounts when, he claimed, ""thousands of people"" in the area hadn't seen any jets. He also took the US to task for an airstrike on Satruday that killed 62 Syrian soldiers, calling it a ""deliberate and unacceptable aggression."" The US has said it was an accident.

He pointed to repeated Syrian attacks on civilians, detailed shifting Russian explanations about the aid convoy attack and ridiculed Moscow's argument that political talks shouldn't be burdened with preconditions. The US has said that Russia bears responsibility for the attack on the convoy because they were the only two countries flying planes over the area at that time and Russia had pledged to restrain Syria. ""The primary question is no longer what do we know,"" Kerry said. ""The primary question is, collectively, what are we going to do about it? In other words, this is a moment of truth."" Washington, Moscow clash Lavrov needled the US over opposition groups during his address. Washington and Moscow have clashed over Russian targeting of moderate Syrian opposition groups backed by the US. The Russians have claimed that some of these groups are not particularly moderate and have accused opposition groups of violating the ceasefire. On Wednesday, Lavrov called for all members of the International Syrian Support Group to ensure that the opposition groups over which they have influence will comply with the cessation of hostilities. Otherwise, he added, ""We can't preserve Syria as a single, united state."" And he alluded to ""geopolitical engineering,"" a reference to Russian concerns about US attempts at ""regime change."" Syria's Jaafari echoed the argument, telling the meeting that the International Syrian Support Group was ""formed outside international legitimacy"" and was ""reminiscent of other destructive coalitions that only brought disasters to countries like Iraq and Libya and Yemen."" The only success the US has managed to achieve, Jaafari said, is to level ""false accusations"" about the ""suffering of Syrians to demonize the Syrian government and its allies."" Four failed ceasefires Kerry had left the meeting before the Syrian ambassador spoke, but when Jaafari had finished speaking, Ambassador Michele Sison, the US deputy representative to the UN, asked to address the council. ""My colleagues are entitled to their own opinions but not to their own facts,"" Sison said. ""Let's just keep in mind just who is prolonging the suffering of the people of Syria."" Jaafari's remarks had been ""so full of untruths that I feel no need to say anything further,"" she said. For his part, earlier in the meeting, Kerry mocked Lavrov's argument that there should be no preconditions before political negotiations start. Citing four international-level agreements calling for a cessation of hostilities that could then lead to peace talks, Kerry said, ""that's not a precondition. That's an international agreement, four times arrived at."" ""Four times, it's been shredded by independent actors,"" Kerry said, ""by spoilers who don't want a cease-fire."" Half of Syria's population has been uprooted, many of them fleeing to Europe, and well over 300,000 men, women and children have been killed, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told the meeting. ""Those who believe the crisis in Syria cannot become even worse are dead wrong,"" Kerry said, ""as are those who believe there's a military solution.""",0.031180401,0.0044543429999999995,0.005567929,0.006681514,0.059020045,0.266146993,0.002227171,2,-1,1
"Terence Crutcher was shot and killed on Sept. 16 in an officer-involved shooting in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Since then, the media have tried to push a false narrative that Crutcher had his hands up when he was shot ? but video evidence, as it often does in these cases, disproved themedia theory.There also more information that the mainstream media conveniently left out. Crutcher had a hefty criminal record before he was shot. In fact, he had just been released in May after nine years in prison for drug trafficking, WZ reported. He also had a history of resisting arrest. Behold the rap sheet: 1996 Shooting with intent to kill ? Dismissed 2001 Petit larceny ? Conviction 2004 Driving while suspended ? Conviction 2005 Driving while suspended, resisting officer ? Conviction 2006 Driving while suspended ? Conviction Driving with open container ? Dismissed 2006 Trafficking in illegal drugs ? Conviction. (He was also charged in that incident with assault on a police officer and resisting, but that was dismissed.) 2011 Public intoxication (while in prison for drug trafficking) ? Conviction 2012 Public intoxication ? Conviction Obstructing an officer ? Conviction 2013 DUI ? Conviction Resisting officer ? Conviction Open Container ? Conviction Failure to wear seatbelt ? Conviction Speeding ? Conviction TRENDING:Gov Confiscates Family Pet to Use as ?Educational Animal? But even all of that was not all. Take a look at the numerous open warrants for Crutcher. These Aug. 30 warrants were active at the time of his death, and as you can see in the graphic below, they included things like DUI, resisting, drug trafficking and public intoxication. The media are actively pushing the narrative that Crutcher had his hands up and that the police shot him anyway.We heard this lie peddled by the media before, in the Michael Brown case, and clearly the obtuse mediadidn learn a thing. Helicopter video footage ofCrutcher altercation with police has surfaced. Take a look. Now, you watch that video and listen to the commentary. Did it look to you like Crutcher was following commands? You can hear an officer say that Crutcher was ?still walking? and that hewasn ?following commands.? Another officer said that he ?could be on something.? Take a look at these pictures Bearing Arms grabbed from the video that disprove themedia false narrative: RELATED: Democrat Leadership: Bicyclist Films 10 Straight Minutes of Shantytowns As you can see, Crutcher was not shot with his hands up. He was clearly flouting officer orders, and at the time of his shooting he lowered his right hand toward his waistband. Oh, and by the way, the media have run with the story that Crutcher was unarmed, butdidn seem too interested in the PCP that was found in his car and that the Tulsa Police Department officer who shot Crutcher, Betty Shelby, was trained to spot PCP abuse, according to Bearing Arms. In any of these cases, the legal system should be given time to do its job, but the media have decided to run false narratives that fit their agenda without all the facts and, in some cases, despite the facts. As you can see above,there clearly more to the story.

"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ushered the 2016 presidential campaign into a new phase tonight, and they did it with plenty of barbs. Interested in Elections? Add Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest The two candidates faced off in their first general election debate at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York, in front of what was expected to be a historic number of television viewers. Here are 10 moments that mattered at the first general election presidential debate: 1. Nominees Started Off on a Friendly Note but No Escaping the Sarcasm Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have lobbed insults at each other from far away for months, but tonight they tried to start their highly anticipated face off on a genteel note, although the mutual contempt was just below the surface. When Clinton walked out in a red pantsuit and Trump in a blue tie -- the opponents? trading traditional party colors -- the two shook hands and Clinton said, ?How are you, Donald?? Perhaps trying to throw him off at the top with a warm greeting. Shortly after the debate began, Trump talked about overseas trade deals, saying, ?But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton,? before stopping himself and turning to his opponent and saying, ?Yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.? He seemed to be referring to his addressing her as ?Secretary Clinton,? although itwasn completely clear during the moment. 2. Personal Attacks Came Early Clinton was first to go on the attack duringtonight debate, taking aim atTrump business roots by claiming he borrowed $14 million from his father to start his real estate business. ?Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that. I have a different experience,? Clinton said, before expanding on herfather work as a drapery maker. Trump responded to that personal claim rather than addressing her subsequent remarks that he believes in ?trumped up, trickle-down? economics. ?For one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars,? Trump said. 3. Trading Barbs Over Trade Voters saw the first fiery moment of the debate when the two candidates sparred over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Trump accused Clinton of supporting TPP, the proposed trade agreement between the United States and 11 other countries along the Pacific Rim. ?And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it,? Trump said. Clinton fired back, ?Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.? Trump then pointed toClinton once referring to TPP as the ?gold standard of trade deals.? ?Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts,? Clinton said. Clinton promoted TPP as secretary of state under President Obama, who is pushing the trade deal. While speaking in Australia in November 15, 2012, Clinton said, ""TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.? Clinton came out against the trade deal October of last year, saying that ?what I know about it as of today I am not in favor of what I have learned about it.? 4. Trump Asks ?Why Not? Blame All theWorld Problems on Clinton Less than 30 minutes into the debate, Trump went after Clinton, attacking her on trade, ISIS, taxes, the economy and more. Clinton quipped: ""I have a feeling by the end of this evening I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.? Trumpdidn miss a beat, saying to his opponent: ?Why not?? Clinton responded: ""Why not? Yeah. Why not? Just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this?? Trump interjected: ""There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into the country,? before the moderator reminded Trump, ""This is secretary Clinton's two minutes, please."" Drew Angerer/Getty Images 5. Trump Hit Over Not Releasing Tax Returns Trump clashed with his Democratic rival over his decision not to release his tax returns. ?I don't mind releasing. I'm under a routine audit and it will be released,? he said. Trump went on to tout his disclosure of a different federally mandated form required by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics of everyone from presidential candidates to the postmaster general. Trump then pivoted to attack Clinton over her private email server. ?I will release my tax returns against my lawyer's wishes when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted,? he said. ?I think you've just seen another example of bait and switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has release their tax returns,? she said. ?You got to ask yourself: Why won't he release his tax returns? ?Maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes,? she said. 6. The Birther Issue Gets on the Main Stage Moderator Lester Holt asked Trump ?what took you so long? to acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States, bringing the Republicannominee recent turnaround on an issue that was central to his public positions for years. At first, Trump claimed that two Clinton aides were the ones who initially looked into BarackObama birth certificate during the 2008 campaign -- a claim that he has made before -- and then said that he was satisfiedwith when Obama released his birth certificate. Holt noted that Obama released his longform birth certificate in 2011, but Trump continued to raise questions aboutit authenticity until 2015. ?Nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it,? Trump said, referencing the years between the release andTrump decision this month to acknowledge Obama was born in America. ?I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job.? Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images 7. Clinton Defends Being PreparedWhen Trump Questions Her Time Off the Trail Trump was talking about crime in the inner cities when he said, ?I?ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that's OK,? seeming to jab Clinton for leaving the campaign trail in recent days to prepare fortonight faceoff. ""I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,? Clinton said. ""And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.? Throughout the debate, Clinton tried to portray Trump as unprepared and unwilling to do the hard work to prepare for the presidency. She also hit back against an attack he regularly makes on the campaign trail: That she doesn't stump as much as he does because she doesn't have his endurance. 8. Stop and Frisk Becomes a Big Point of DiscussionTrump support of stop and frisk, a controversial tactic once heavily used by the New York Police Department, was discussed at length during the debate. ?Stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did, it had a very very big impact,? Trump said. Trump said that the tactic was not deemed unconstitutional -- which it was -- and added instead that ?it went before a judge who was a very against-police judge.? ?They would have won an appeal,? he said, noting that there was no appeal. Trump and Clinton went on to debate various crime rates in cities like Chicago and New York for nearly 10 minutes of the debate. 9. Trump and the Iraq War Under the Microscope Toward the end of the debate, Holt corrected Trump on whether he supported the war in Iraq before it started. ?I did not support the war in Iraq,? Trump said. ""That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.? Holt corrected him, saying, ?The record shows otherwise.? The only time Trump seems to have spoken about the war publicly before it started was to Howard Stern in 2002 and seemed to support the invasion. Stern asked Trump, ?Are you for invading Iraq?"" Trump appeared to hesitate, responding, ?Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.? Despite the attempt to correct him, Trump continued to stress he was against the war, saying, ?The record shows that I am right.? 10. Sparring Over Stamina Holt asked Trump about when he once said that Clinton does not have a ?presidential look,? asking Trump what he meant by that. Trump pivoted to attack her ?stamina.? ""She doesn't have the look, shedoesn have the stamina,? Trump said. ""I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.? Trump has been hitting Clinton on her stamina and strength on the campaign trail for months, but tonight Clinton tried to shut that line of attack down. ""Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities and nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina,? Clinton said. She also attempted to remind voters of some of the more controversial things he has said about women: ""One thing Lester, he tried to switch from looks to stamina,? Clinton said. ""But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs. And someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers. Who has said women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.?",0.04437401,0.009508716,0.0063391440000000005,0.00792393,0.07369255200000001,0.28526149,0.0007923930000000001,2,-1,1
"With the growing threat of terrorism around the world, and the increased hostilities from both the Soviet Union and North Korea, combined with a sustained and continuous policy of purging our military capabilities Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno believeswe reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point. Speaking at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, the General said; ?The Army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it's incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go."" However the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from thepresident astounding incompetence,there also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers. The General went on to explain; ""Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,"" Odierno said. ""Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago."" The Army has cut 80,000 soldiers out of the active force, reorganized and cut 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades from the active component. Investment in modernization is down by 25%, Odierno said, sidelining ""much-needed"" infantry fighting vehicle modernization and a scout helicopter development program.",0.018348623999999997,0.0,0.0,0.004587155999999999,0.041284404,0.211009174,0.009174311999999999,1,-1,0
"Story highlights Poll: 62% say Clinton won, 27% said Trump did It's a similar result to Romney topping Obama in four years ago (CNN) Hillary Clinton was deemed the winner of Monday night's debate by 62% of voters who tuned in to watch, while just 27% said they thought Donald Trump had the better night, according to a CNN/ORC Poll of voters who watched the debate. That drubbing is similar to Mitt Romney's dominant performance over President Barack Obama in the first 2012 presidential debate. Voters who watched said Clinton expressed her views more clearly than Trump and had a better understanding of the issues by a margin of more than 2-to-1. Clinton also was seen as having done a better job addressing concerns voters might have about her potential presidency by a 57% to 35% margin, and as the stronger leader by a 56% to 39% margin. The gap was smaller on which candidate appeared more sincere and authentic, though still broke in Clinton's favor, with 53% saying she was more sincere vs. 40% who felt Trump did better on that score. Trump topped Clinton 56% to 33% as the debater who spent more time attacking their opponent. Read More",0.054054054000000004,0.0067567569999999995,0.0,0.02027027,0.060810811,0.277027027,0.0,2,-1,1

"Story highlights Lanhee Chen is a research fellow Hoover Institution who worked for Romney and Rubio Party People is a new podcast from CNN where a pair of conservative CNN contributors talk to influential voices about the future of conservatism and the Republican party. Washington (CNN) If Donald Trump thinks his dominance in the Republican primary debates will translate to success in next week's matchup against Hillary Clinton, Lanhee Chen thinks the GOP nominee is in for a surprise. ""He can't fake his way through 90 minutes,"" Chen, a research fellow Hoover Institution and a CNN contributor, told CNN's Party People podcast hosts Kevin Madden and Mary Katherine Ham. Trump participated in debates throughout the Republican presidential primary schedule, emerging largely unscathed in the polls after fighting off more than a dozen GOP presidential primary opponents, and locking up the party's nomination by May. Chen, a Republican policy wonk who worked for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Florida Sen.

"Obama?s Speech In New York Shocks Americans When He Says THIS About Attacks! I would say our President is useless, but really, this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance. He has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this? This is just tone deaf to the nth power.I guessing that ifyou reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota. While you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong. Surelyyou want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil.

"Democrats are starting to show cracks in their support for legislation that would allow families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia ? suggesting White House opposition to the bill may be resonating with lawmakers preparing for the first veto override vote of BarackObama presidency. But to sustain his expected veto, Obama will need to persuade 34 senators to change course and oppose the bill ? a very difficult task. The legislation sailed through both chambers with no opposition. And the White House now has scant time to make its case to Capitol Hill, with a veto override vote in the Senate expected this month. Story Continued Below Still, there are glimmers of hope for the administration. Key lawmakers are now making it clear they remain undecided on overridingObama presumed veto ? a notable departure from the overwhelming show of support behind the legislation when it unanimously passed both chambers earlier this year. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, indicated this week that she was rethinking her support for the Saudi Arabia legislation amid renewed arguments against the measure from the Obama administration. ?I do have some second thoughts with respect to that,? Feinstein said. ?I think it could bring on a whole host of unintended consequences.? House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, said Tuesday that ?this is not a bill without complex ramifications? and he wanted to seeObama formal veto and his rationale for opposing the legislation before making up his mind on overriding it. ?I think it would be incorrect for any member to think this is a very simple issue, that it may not have ramifications for the United States in other venues around the world,? Hoyer said. ?Having said that, I will reiterate, I share and there is great sympathy among the Senate, the House, bipartisan, to assure that the American families who have suffered great grief and loss have an avenue to address their grievances.? But their public trepidation is going up against relentless lobbying from family members of the Sept. 11 victims, who have proved to be a powerful force. When Republican Sens. Bob Corker of Tennessee and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina began expressing their qualms with the legislation and suggesting that a veto override should be held off until the end of the year, the families fired back, saying the Republicans are asking ?far more than the families and survivors should ever be asked to accept.? That ferocious push continued into Tuesday, as Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) met privately with 9/11 families in his office and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) held a news conference outside the Capitol with victims of the terrorist attacks. Another enemy working against the White House is simple: time. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday he plans to hold the override vote before senators leave Washington to campaign, dramatically cutting down the time the White House has to coax enough senators to sustainObama expected rejection of the 9/11 legislation. McConnell said he assumed the veto will be overridden. The president has yet to formally issue a veto, but he is required to do so by Friday. Because the legislation originated from the Senate, that chamber will move first on an override. Speaking to reporters in New York, where Obama was attending the U.N. General Assembly, White House press secretary Josh Earnest acknowledged that the administration faces a ?steep hill? in addressing their own concerns about the 9/11 bill. Yet Earnest suggested that more lawmakers are on their side than public comments would indicate. ?Aswe made this case, members of Congress in both parties have indicated that they are open to the concerns thatwe expressed. In many cases, they share them,? Earnest said. ?And the real question for members of Congress will be whether or notthey prepared to cast a vote that is consistent with the views and feelings that they expressed in private.? The White House has repeatedly listed several concerns with the measure, including its view that the 9/11 bill could open up U.S. officials to legal retaliation in foreign courts. Earnest has also argued that the legislation could lead to different judges in different courtrooms coming up with varying terror designations about the same country. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee, said he still had not decided whether he would support overridingObama presumed veto. ?I certainly agree with the premise? of the bill, Durbin said. But ?some colleagues, in this case Graham and Corker have raised questions about whether or not there ought to be some modifications.I talked with Sen. [Chuck] Schumer, there already have been modifications made.? The legislation, formally known as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, amends the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act to prevent countries involved in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil from invoking sovereign immunity, a legal principle that shields foreign nations from legal action. That would pave the way for 9/11 families to pursue lawsuits related to the attacks.It not a new measure in Capitol Hill; it cleared the Senate last Congress and then resurfaced in the chamber earlier this year. This time, proponents of the legislation note that changes have already been made to the legislation to accommodate concerns from the Obama administration, and in their view,there little room left for a compromise. Still, other influential Democrats show signs of taking pause. ?I certainlydon want to shield those who are supporting terrorism,? said Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. ?On the other hand, I understand the importance of sovereign immunity as it relates to international activities. SoI like to understand thepresident concerns, whether there are alternative ways to handle this before I make a judgment.? Late Tuesday, Graham said he has been in touch with the White House and Saudi officials but said he was pessimistic on any prospects to come up with revisions to satisfy both the victims? families, as well as ease the Obamaadministration diplomatic concerns. ?It?s either/or politics now,? Graham said. ?You?re either for 9/11 families oryou for Saudi Arabia. Itshouldn be that way.? Other key Republicans also stressed they were also undecided. ?I?m willing to hear [the WhiteHouse] concerns,? said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, which crafted the bill. The two top senators on the Judiciary Committee ? Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and ranking member Patrick Leahy of Vermont ? both said they firmly backed the legislation, which emerged from their committee earlier this year before passing the full Senate in May. ?It should be 100-0, but Idon expect that it will be,? Grassley said of a vote to override a veto of the 9/11 bill. ?If peopledon want to override the veto, theyshould expressed their opposition earlier.?

"They were searching for years. It finally happened. They eventually found their onetrue gem after lastyear failure. Now after years of searching, liberals finally feel likethey seen a woman who can win the Presidency. Ironically, the notion to find a TV star candidate was stolen from the fact that President Trump had a bit of a TV career to go along with the rest of his business ventures.It also not lost on anyone that there are no two names more synonymous with wealth in America than Donald Trump and Oprah Winfrey.It quite funny that people on the left kept spouting off that youcan have a television billionaire run for President ? but now they have their television billionaire they want to run for President. Funny how that works, right? The left has literally copied exactly what the right does becausethey unable to craft their own winning strategy. Liberals have found PresidentTrump antithesis and plan to run her against him in the next presidential election of 2020. Winfrey is also boosted by the fact that she has a couple of social justice warrior bonus points working in her favor;she black, andshe a she. She has everything that they said Hillary had, but without that annoying and predatory Bill tagging along for the free ride. The one other thing that Oprah has in common with President Trump is that her careerhasn been in politics. Shehasn had to look over her shoulder and watch her mouth for her entire life.She just been giving out prizes from under the seats of her show set and participating in other business ventures that have nothing to do with politics. In the case of President Trump, thatdidn matter too much, because hewasn running on a platform of political correctness.That where they differ. Oprah would most likely be on the plan with political correctness, something that America has gotten sick of hearing about. Oprah has given numerous honest and very liberal opinions over the years, and that is now coming back to haunt her. To make matters worse, the bumbling mainstream media is jumping up to defend her, andit not going well.It scary to think of Oprah Winfrey in the Oval Office as anything more than a guest taking a tour. Her unashamed opinion on race issues and disdain for white people could be a problem. The longtime TV host has become increasingly anti-white over the years, to the point thatshe handing down a proverbial death sentence to those whodon agree with her. Her idea is that racism is a problem of the past, so to fix the problem, those who lived in that time just need to die.That right folks. It was a horrible thing she said, and this video would be the bane of her existence if she ever ran for President.

For a billionaire there could have been a more ""eloquent "" way to say this. Money doesn't buy class. ? Kim (@KimKing2018) January 8, 2018It difficult to see someone who is considered to be a national leader asking for the death of hundreds of thousands of Americans.It even more painful to think people would want her to run the country with that attitude. Now, to be fair,she probably right about a small fraction of the older generation. There will always be at least a few people who say racially inappropriate things, but they do not stand for or represent the majority of our good Americans. Even if there are a few old cronies with a racist bone in their body, thatdoesn mean everyone is like that. That alsodoesn mean Oprah should call for a mass genocide of old white people. That is a terrible and racist thing to say. It makes Oprah look like the black female Hitler who calls for the killing of a particular kind of people. Is that who the American people would want to vote for? Idon think so. It is NOT EVER OK to suggest that Americans try to kill people off just because they disagree with someone. What Oprah said is unforgivable and disgusting. We cannot believe she would say anything like that. This probably seems exceptionally radical, based on what she just said, that someone would try to kill an old person becausethey racist, butit perhaps not as far-fetched as you might think. Currently, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington have ?death with dignity? laws that allow a terminally ill patient to voluntarily request and receive a prescription medication to hasten their death. This practice is also called euthanasia, which is a term that encompasses any physician-assisted suicide, and it dates back as far as ancient Greece and Rome. The United States is beginning to accept the reasoning that a person might need to die before their natural time, based strictly on the quality of life. Right now, as with most of the new technologies offered to us,it optional. If we decide that our lifeisn worth living, we can end it. However, throughout most of history, ithasn been the patient choosing whether to pull their plug. In a socialist society, whereit all for one and one for all, someone always has to decide what will be for the ?greater good.? In fact, Euthanasia comes from the Greek words, Eu (good) and Thanatosis (death) and it means ?Good Death, ?Gentle and Easy Death.? This word is used for ?mercy killing.? Withdrawal or with-holding treatment was practiced in history, the correct term for this is orthothanasia, which means ?passive death.? If you combine that with the incredibly scary, and over-reaching liberties taken in the Affordable Care Act (aka, Obamacare), then you can see how we were (and maybe still are) a hop, skip and a jump from the government choosing who lives and dies. If racism is considered cancer that should be cut out, then racism is redefined to mean anything liberals want, they would be able to hand down a death sentence to anyone the government wanted, by withdrawing care. ?Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.? That is what we were promised in the constitution, butwe now come full circle to the point where we need to depend on another truth given to us by a founding father: We must, indeed, all hang together or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately. ?

"Democrats have some advice for Hillary Clinton at her first presidential debate: Let Trump be Trump. DonaldTrump more tightly scripted campaign of late could backfire on him when he squares off against Clinton on Monday in Hempstead, New York, Democrats believe. Hewon be able to rely on the teleprompterhe been using of late, they say, andTrump only recent extended interview with The Washington Post showed that, left to his own devices,he apt to stumble back into controversy on issues like BarackObama birthplace. Story Continued Below ?He?s going to say some cockamamie stuff,? said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Jon Tester (D-Mont.). ?Give him the rope.? Indeed, the best strategy for Clinton, lawmakers advised, is to let Trump do most of the talking. ?Inevitably,he going to say enough dumb things to dominate the headlines,? said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). ?He?s gonna make mistakes; the question is, how big are the mistakes? AndI certain there are things she can do that would cause his mistakes to be bigger.? Clinton will have to parry when Trump comes directly at her, but a more restrained rope-a-dope strategy is preferable to an aggressive posture right out of the gate, Democratic senators said. Trump showed in the Republican debates thathe best as a counter-puncher, leveling spontaneous one-liners at his attackers that left them reeling. In one debate alone, Trump dubbed Sen. Marco Rubio a ?choke artist? and Sen. Ted Cruz a ?basket case.? Rubio notoriously jumped in the sandbox but lackedTrump talent ? if you want to call it that ? for making his zingers stick. Those moments should be instructive to Clinton, Democrats say, and serve as a warning that she should not rush into a war of words with the pioneer of put-downs. ?She has to be unafraid,? said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. ?He?s a bully; hecan help himself. Idon know howhe going to use a teleprompter in a debate situation. And hecan control himself. His attention span is nonexistent.? Yet implicit inReid comments is what is expected of Trump by Democrats: very little. And low expectations could be damaging on a debate night that will set the tone for a six-week sprint toward Election Day. Though Trump has been less bombastic over the past month,he still making headlines on a daily basis, whether by suggesting thatClinton Secret Service detail be disarmed or taking credit for predicting recent terrorist attacks in New York. Given the freewheeling nature of presidential debates, Democrats hope voters will see the vintage Trumpthat been partly concealed in recent weeks. ?Expectations have been exceptionally low for Trump. I thinkthat why in large part he has gotten away with it,? said Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.). ?If 150 million people are suddenly glued to their TV sets ? they are going to be expecting to see the conduct of who they would want in a future president.? ?He?ll do it himself,? said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). ?There?s never been a time wherehe talked for longer than 30 seconds wherehe managed to say anything. He just says nothing.He say the same empty phrases over and over again, and I think it will become obvious after an hour and a half.? The debate performances of Clinton and Trump are the subject of much chatter among Democrats on Capitol Hill, who have watched the race tighten after a summer surge by Clinton. When Clinton last visited with Senate Democrats in July, she remarked to the room that she has gotten more advice on debates than any other topic. ?Everybody in the room laughed, because most of us had given her advice on what to do,? recounted Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).There no constituency that will benefit more from a strong Clinton performance than Democrats desperately trying to take back the Senate this fall. They probably need a healthy Clinton victory to flip a minimum of four seats needed to recapture the chamber. And Clinton needs a strong debate performance to reassert the clear upper hand in the race. ?Of courseit important;she the head of the ticket. The better she does, [the better] we do,? Reid said. ?She?s been a successful debater in the race we had with Obama. Andshe been good in the primaries with [Sen. Bernie Sanders] screaming and yelling at her all the time.? Democrats are counting on Clinton to not just wait for Trump to stumble; she also has to make an affirmative case to undecided voters, they say. That means contrasting her detailed plans for health care, the minimum wage and immigration withTrump more broad-brush stands on many issues. ?Idon think that the question is about attacking Trump at this point.It about pointing out her vision for the country,? said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.). ?People vote not only on who they oppose, but they want to vote for something.? Trump bragged on Fox News this week that he has the strongesttemperament. But Democrats are betting the 90-minute showdown will reveal the opposite. ?It?s important for people to see this side of him that is very much unpresidential and out of control,? said Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.). ?It?s temperament, as much as anything. People want to trust that their president ? is in control.?",0.049050632999999996,0.009493671,0.003164557,0.007911392,0.068037975,0.24683544300000002,0.006329114,2,-1,1
"A reporter for The Washington Post, David Fahrenthold, has uncovered another instance where GOP nominee Donald Trump has made some questionable tax-related choices. The investigation that Faherenthold launched into the Trump Foundation, along with Republican presidential nominee DonaldTrump personal finances, has unearthed the fact that Donald Trump has used his charitable foundation, which is tax-exempt, as a tool to evade $2.3 million dollars of personal income taxes. How? By having business associates that owe him money to put it into his foundation instead. An excellent example is that the Trump Foundation took in payments ?totaling nearly $1.9 million from a man in New York City who sells sought-after tickets and one-of-a-kind experiences to wealthy clients.? According to sources in the Trump organization who wish to remain anonymous the man is Richard Ebers, and he was told that instead of paying the former reality TV star for services, he should pay the Trump Foundation instead. It makes sense really, when you consider the fact that despite the reality that Donald Trumphasn even bothered donating to his own foundation since 2008 the donationscontinue to pour in. One of Republican presidential nominee DonaldTrump senior advisers, Boris Epshteyn, actually tried to explain it away by saying: ?What Trump did was provide a service, renounce any fees, and then merely suggestthat the other party make a donation to a charity of their choosing.? The irony is not lost on anyone thathe basically sayingit legal, and it is, despite the fact that anyone with half a mind deduce the shady implications. Marc Owens, Head of the Internal RevenueService non-profit watchdog agency,hasn been very thorough in his monitoring of the Trump foundation and seems shocked by all of the information thatFahrenthold investigation has managed to uncover. Owens, said: ?This is so bizarre, this laundry list of issues.It the first timeI ever seen this, andI been doing this for 25 years in the IRS, and 40 years total.?It pretty obvious to anyonethat paying attention that the GOP nominee is probably violating the rules that were written to prevent this kind of blatant laundering of money when it comes to tax-exempt foundations. If Donald Trump were to be charged and found guilty of violating these laws the punishment would mean a monetary penalty, losing the tax-exempt status for his foundation, and even, perhaps, criminal charges being filed. When asked by journalist Sharyl Attkisson: ?Are you confident that the Trump Foundation has followed all charitable rules and laws?? Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump responded: ?Well, I hope so? I mean, my lawyers do it.?It kind of ironic that the Trump campaign would go after the Clinton Foundation when Republican presidential nominee DonaldTrump own Trump Foundation has such shady things going on. For shady example, his foundation has zero paid staff. The Trump Foundation has literally been laundering money under the guise of being a charityand the person profiting from it all is none-other-than Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

"AP Photo Opinion How Trump Could Win the Debate Hillary Clinton will almost certainly win Mondaynight epic presidential debate on points ? and still could lose.It hard to see how Clinton, who has marinated in public policy for 30 years and is preparing for the debate like it is the invasion of Normandy,won repeatedly best Donald Trump on substance. Story Continued Below Her strength in this area perfectly matchesTrump weakness. Trump has appeared to learn for the first time such basic information as that the Trans-Pacific Partnershipdoesn include China and that Russia has already invaded Ukraine on the debate stage or during a media interview. He sometimes reads his speeches as if they include revelations to him ? ?so true,?he interject after coming across a striking fact or observation in the text. If Trump has spent time hitting the briefing books, his campaign has kept it under wraps and he has yet to reveal any hint of a new policy depth in anythinghe said over the past few weeks. So Trumpwon be particularly well-informed, and figures itwon particularly matter ? and may well be right. Trump has a significant built-in advantage in that there is a lower standard for him ? not because the mediaisn tough enough on him, as all the media mavens agree, but because he is the de facto challenger and candidate of change in a change election. Trump can win by clearing a bar of acceptability, whereas Clinton has to do more than that and either significantly wound Trump or make a compellingly positive case for herself that has so far eluded her in both 2008 and 2016. This is not to say that Trumpwon be on treacherous terrain. Hecan bully and mock Clinton the way he did his Republican rivals. Hewon have a crowd to feed off of. Without a teleprompter, message discipline still tends to elude him. The one-on-one format for an hour-and-a-half could make his thin knowledge painfully obvious. And any misstep or outburst that reinforces the idea that he lacks the qualities to be commander in chief would be devastating. But Trump just needs to seem plausible and the very fact that he is on a presidential debate stage, the most rarified forum in American politics, will benefit him. During the Republican primary debates, the intangibles worked in his favor and they presumably will on Monday, too. Trump is a big personality with a dominant physical presence. His critics often sneeringly say he is a reality TV star, but youdon become one without charisma and a performative ability that are major political assets. The fact is that Trump will have to stumble badly ? and probably sabotage himself ? to live down toHillary critique of him. She has made her campaign almost entirely about how Trump is a monstrous madman. This was an understandable calculation ? she wanted to disqualify him out of the box and differentiate and isolate him from other Republicans. The cost is that she has done more than anyone to lower the standard for Trump.It not as though he needs to mount a convincing, detailed defense of his tax or child care plan or anything else to invalidateClinton critique of him; he just needs to seem a reasonable person. That is why Trumpdoesn need to be the aggressor. As long ashe firm and calm, he is implicitly rebutting the case against him on temperament. And then he can look for a big moment or two that will be memorable and drive the post-debate conversation in the media that is arguably as important as the debate itself. These contestsaren evaluated by college-debate judges. Trump won one of the Republican primary debates with his barbed quip in response to VicenteFox vulgar declaration that Mexicowouldn pay for the wall, ?The wall just got 10 feet higher.? Thiswasn an argument or a policy; it was a sentiment. No one would have written it down in a briefing book. And yet, it punched through. If Trump has taught us anything, it is that simple, evocative statements can make up for a multitude of evasions and confused non-answers. In the past, most presidential debates have had a slight or ephemeral effect on the race. Monday could be different because it is an event tailor-made for Trump to change one of the main factors holding him back. By roughly 60 percent to 30 percent, people think Clinton is prepared to be president; by roughly 60 percent to 30 percent, people think Trump is not. A credible performance could move that number for Trump, and appreciably increase his odds of winning the presidency. Hillary is both formidably well-prepared for Monday, and at significant risk. Such is the dynamic of the race and the way most voters absorb information that she could winon points, and still lose ground.

"Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence. Interested in Keith Lamont Scott? Add Keith Lamont Scott as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Keith Lamont Scott news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest But none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl. Zianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears streaking her face, brought into focus the stress police shootings place on children, as well as the pain the black community of Charlotte has suffered in the wake of Scott's death last week. ?I?ve been born and raised in Charlotte. And I never felt this way until now and Ican stand howwe treated,? the grade-school girl said, wiping away tears. David T. Foster III/The Charlotte Observer via AP Photo She expressed the hardship that children face when a parent dies. Scott himself, who was African-American, had seven children. ?It?s a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. And we have tears. Weshouldn have tears. We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side,? she said. Zianna, as well as the protesters in the room who chanted ""no justice, no peace"" after she spoke, helped to underscore the degree to which communal wounds have been slow to heal in NorthCarolina most populous city since the shooting. Protests started on the streets of Charlotte after news of Scott's shooting broke last Tuesday and, occasionally, became violent as they continued deeper into the week. David T. Foster III/The Charlotte Observer via AP Photo The scene grew especially tense Wednesday night when police clad in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators. Some people in the crowds threw bottles and rocks at officers and passing cars, blocked an interstate highway, surrounded and jumped on vehicles, looted businesses and stormed the entrance of a Hyatt hotel, injuring two of its employees. At the city council meeting, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts called for decorum at several points during public remarks. At several points, protesters yelled criticism of her and Police Chief Kerr Putney. After the meeting wrapped up, The Charlotte Observer reported, more than 20 protesters moved to the lobby of the Government Center. ?Release. Release.

Chief Putney has released body and dashboard camera videos of the fatal police shooting of Scott, answering to demands made by community leaders, protesters and politicians.

"The epidemic of black men being killed at the hands of police officers in America has not gone unnoticed on the international stage. According to a According to a report by a United Nations working group, which will be debated at the U.N. Human Rights Council on Monday, this situation constitutes a full-blown ?human rights crisis? that is reminiscent of the days of lynchings. ?Contemporary police killings and the trauma that they create are reminiscent of the past racial terror of lynching,? said the report by the U.N. Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent. The U.N. report draws a stark comparison between modern day fatal shootings at the hands of law enforcement and the lynchings of blacks that swept the nation in the 19th and 20th centuries. The report comes as racial tensions in America have boiled over yet again in the wake of more deadly shootings that have rocked the country. Historically, the majority of African Americans killed in lynchings were hanged. The Equal Justice Initiative released a report in 2015 which said that between 1877 and 1950, an estimated 3,959 black people were murdered in ?racial terror lynchings? throughout thecountry southern states. The U.N. report follows a January visit to the U.S. by a five-member group, which was chaired by Filipino law professor Ricardo A. Sunga III. The group says that despite efforts at reform, they still remain ?extremely concerned? about the ?human rights crisis? facing blacks living in the U.S., and this is especially true considering protesters are once again flooding the streets of American cities to protest the killings of still more black men in recent days. ?In particular, the legacy of colonial history, enslavement, racial subordination and segregation, racial terrorism and racial inequality in the United States remains a serious challenge, as there has been no real commitment to reparations and to truth and reconciliation for people of African descent. ?Impunity for State violence has resulted in the current human rights crisis and must be addressed as a matter of urgency.? The experts? group pointed out that these killings go unpunished because the investigation is biased and tainted from the beginning since police departments are investigating their own. Adding to this is the fact that prosecutors have discretion when it comes to presenting charges and U.S. law enforcement officers are not held to international standards for use of force. To address the situation, they recommended that the U.S. institute a system to reliably track police killings nationwide and instances of excessive use of force. They also said that racial profiling must be brought to an end, which is ?a rampant practice and seriously damages the trust between African-Americans and law enforcement officials.? The group also said that improving race relations will also require education that must be ?accompanied by acts of reconciliation? in order to successfully overcome the bigotry that plagues the U.S. and the past injustices that have been perpetrated against black people on American soil. The report added that the lasting negative effects caused by enslavement and racial injustice must be recognized by both federal and state laws.

"In the first half of the debate, Donald Trump seemed bogged down by some very distracting sniffles. After peddling for weeks a lucrative conspiracy that Hillary Clinton is too sick to be Commander-In-Chief, one must ask themselves why Trumpcouldn stop sniffling. Is he sick? Was he holding back tears (after being pummeled by Clinton)? Howard Dean, former head of the DNC and presidential candidate, has a more unconventional answer: he was on drugs. Dean, who is now a contributor for MSNBC, tweeted last night: Notice Trump sniffing all the time. Coke user? ? Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) September 27, 2016 Trump supporters took to Twitter to express outrage, completely forgetting that their preferred candidate spent weeks fueling sexist attacks against Clinton and her stamina abilities. But hey, get offended when Dean points out what could be the obvious. After all, Trump did protect a cocaine trafficker from serving proper jail time by pulling some strings in the justice system. And considering hehasn released any medical records, who knows what adverse effects drugs (if he does them) has done to his body and mental state. Of course Trump denied he was sniffling, even though the rancid sounds were heard by millions of watchers across the country (and the globe) and the Republican nominee denies that he is sick. So that begs the question: what else could it be.Dean assertion is just that ? an assertion. It has no factual ground to stand on, but it is ironic to see how Trump supporters react when a conspiracy is made against their candidate. Perhaps they (and Trump) will think long and hard before trying to paint Clinton as anythingshe not. If this debate showed one thing,it that Hillary came out on top and Trump is not happy about it.

John Aravosis (@aravosis) September 25, 2016 The statement was exactly what the Trump campaign had been demanding for weeks and was ecstatic to hear. Going intoMonday crucial first presidential debate, the Republican candidate understood that the most dangerous hurdle he had to get around was if the moderator called him on his lies. Trump, who has dismissed preparing for the debate out of hand, lies a lot.That his strength. He needs it to win. Politico recently analyzedTrump last five days on the campaign trail and found that Donald Trump lies at a rate of once every 3 minutes and 15 seconds.Trump misrepresentations range from false pronouncements (he again wrongly said he opposed the war in Iraq before it began) to the petty (he insisted Clinton had copied him by holding rallies with her plane in the background and insinuated she was sleepingwhen she held no public events). He contradicted his own policy on providing health care to the poor, overstated the ad-spending discrepancy between his campaign andClinton and exaggerated the size of his primary victories and polling leads. (For whatit worth, they also fact-checked Clinton and found that while she, like any politician, does fudge the truth occasionally,Trump lying ?so greatly exceed[s]Clinton as to make the comparison almost ludicrous.? Ouch.) And while Debate Commissioner Brown used an intentionally vague example (?unemployment rate?), there is no indication that Trump will reserve lies to things so nuanced.

"Trump: 'There?s nothing like doing things with otherpeople money' Donald Trump, in hot water over a report that his charity used donations to cover business-related legal fees, told a campaign rally crowd on Tuesday that ?there?s nothing like doing things with otherpeople money.? The comment about ?otherpeople money? came during a campaign rally in North Carolina, where Trump pledged to keep refugees from the Middle East out of the U.S. and instead put them in ?safe zones? that would be built with money from Gulf nations. It is a financial maneuver the real estate mogul said he has performed many times throughout his career. Story Continued Below ?It?s called OPM. I do that all the time in business.It called otherpeople money.There nothing like doing things with otherpeople money,? Trump said. ?Because it takes, the risk, you get a good chunk of it and it takes the risk.We going to do this, in this case, from a humanitarian standpoint. OPM: otherpeople money.? Under a Trump administration, the Gulf states would not be the only foreign countries on the hook to pay for the Manhattanbillionaire proposals. From the very beginning of his campaign, Trump has pledged to build a wall alongAmerica southern border and force Mexico to pay for it. DuringTrump visit to Mexico last month, Mexican President EnriquePe Nieto said his nation would not pay for the wall. Trump said the subject of who would pay was not discussed during their meeting. The former reality TV star made his promise to use ?otherpeople money? on the same day The Washington Post published a story accusing Trump of spending $258,000 from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits involving his other businesses.",0.029126213999999997,0.0,0.009708738,0.019417476,0.04368932,0.291262136,0.0,2,-1,1
"Washington  With two months to go before Election Day, Democrats have the cash advantage in the race for the White House, but Republicans have the cash advantage in the race for the Senate. Presidential campaigns and their supportive super PACs filed new numbers Tuesday that continue to show Clinton's cash lead in the homestretch of the presidential race. Clinton's campaign raised $59.5 million and had about $68 million on hand at the end of August; Trump's raised $41.7 million and had $50.2 million on hand. Meanwhile, a cadre of Republican donors -- most prominently, Sheldon Adelson -- are keeping Republicans competitive in down-ballot races. Here are the five takeaways from the money race: Hillary Clinton is very dependent on a few billionaires Under-noticed in this campaign have been the very few Democratic billionaires who are responsible for Clinton's advertising machine: Priorities USA. The super PAC had a record-breaking month, collecting $23.4 million during summer's dog days. The bulk of the money is from a select few: Fred Eychaner and Daniel Abraham, who gave $3 million each, George Soros, who donated $2.5 million, Don Sussman, who kicked in another $2 million, and Laurene Powell Jobs, whose LLC contributed another $2 million. Those five people are responsible for a majority of the money that Priorities USA has raised, and their names have littered Democratic campaign finance reports for the entire 2016 race. Trump doesn't have donors of similar sizes, and that's why his super PACs have failed to keep pace. Only one new name appeared on Trump's PAC's reports: Cherna Moskowitz, who gave $1 million to a group run by close Trump allies (and billionaires) Bob and Rebekah Mercer. What's Clinton's money good for? Ads Clinton has enjoyed a fundraising advantage over Trump for the entire campaign, and it's allowed her to build an organization that Trump could not. The Democratic nominee spent almost $50 million last month -- way more than she spent during any other month -- and that's due to $33 million in ""media buys."" That's more than six times as much as they spent on payroll costs. And her campaign, joint fundraising committees and Priorities USA had $194 million on hand, meaning plenty of more ads are coming. She's still struggling with small donors: only $8.4 million of the money she raised last month if from donors who gave $200 or less. Trump is finally raising the big bucks Despite record spending in the month of August -- including a hefty amount on its digital firm -- Trump still entered the month with over $50 million on hand. Trump collected $12 million from small-dollar donors who gave directly to his campaign, and he himself added another $2 million to his own bid. $20.2 million came from his joint committees with the Republican National Committee. Trump finally began advertising in the month of August, and it's reflected in his campaign finance report. He spent almost $30 million last month, $11.5 million more than he spent in any other month. The return of Mike Bloomberg The former New York City mayor remains the most prominent political donor who hews to the center of the political aisle. His super PAC, Independence USA, has primarily focused on supporting candidates who support restrictions on firearms, and has emerged as a leading backer of Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey. But he personally is backing the Democratic ticket for president. The billionaire last month made his largest donation yet to his group: another $8.5 million from his personal fortune. That's his largest check ever to the super PAC. Senate Republicans have the upper hand Thanks to $21.5 million from the Adelsons , groups backing Senate Republicans have more to spend in the homestretch than do those backing Senate Democrats. The Senate Leadership Fund, an allied group in New Hampshire, and the Koch brothers' super PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, raised $32.5 million in August. That also doesn't include various groups that aren't required to disclose their donors, such as the US Chamber of Commerce or other Koch nonprofit groups. And the Democrats? The main Senate groups -- Senate Majority PAC, Emily's List and the League of Conservation Voters -- took in only $20.5 million. Environmental activist Tom Steyer on Tuesday pledged another $15 million to his joint effort with labor unions to develop a coordinated ground game for the Democratic ticket. But here's what we do know now: The Democrats don't have an Adelson equivalent. Their main Senate donor last month is Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, who along with his wife gave $5 million of the $20 million he has pledged to spend in 2016. In the Senate cash race, Adelson is a game-changer.",0.006568144000000001,0.0016420360000000001,0.006568144000000001,0.006568144000000001,0.014778325,0.18719211800000002,0.011494253000000001,2,-1,1
"Former Va. Sen. John Warner slams Trump during Clinton endorsement ALEXANDRIA, Va. ? Former Republican Sen. John Warner endorsed Hillary Clinton on Wednesday, calling her ?prepared to be a world leader and the United States president.? The longtime Virginia senator cast the choice between Clinton and Donald Trump as a dire one for world security, saying he felt ?distressed by some of the comments? made by Trump, though he did not speakTrump name until the end of his speech, when he said: ?Loose lips sink ships. You got that Trump?? Story Continued Below ?There comes a time when I have to stand up and assert my own views,? Warner said here. ?Ifthere one thing about candidate Clinton thatyou got to understand, she throughout her whole life has been prepared, done her homework and studied.? In particular, Warner was alarmed byTrump criticism of the military, declaring it is not the rubblethat Trump has portrayed it as and calling that criticism ?ridiculous.? Trump has said the state of the military is a ?disaster.? ?We have today the strongest military in the world. No one can compare with us,? Warner said. ?No one should have the audacity to stand up and degrade the purple heart ? or talk about the military being in a state of disaster.That wrong.? Warner also reminisced on serving on the Armed Services Committee with a ?well-prepared? Clinton whose attendance was exemplary. His assessment of Trump was far less glowing. ?Youdon pull up a quick text, like ?National Security for Dummies,?? Warner said. ?That bookhasn been published.? The retired five-term senator is opting to back Clinton over his ownparty nominee as a signal to voters in the swing state of Virginia of who he believes would be best suited to be commander in chief.It the second straight cycle Warner has bucked his party: In 2014, he endorsed Democratic Sen. Mark Warner over Republican challenger Ed Gillespie. Spokespeople for Trump did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, Clinton reveled in the endorsement. ?For 30 years, Virginians trusted John Warner in the Senate, and for good reason: He has dedicated his life to defending our country, from serving in the Navy in World War II to chairing the Senate Armed Services Committee, where I had the honor of working with him to support our men and women in uniform and their families. I am proud to haveJohn support, and to know that someone with his decades of experience would trust me with the weighty responsibility of being Commander in Chief,? Clinton said. The endorsement was rolled out here on Wednesday morning alongside Clinton running mate and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. Warner was a 30-year member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and his endorsement marks another high-profile national security voice to back Clinton.It the first Democratic presidential candidate Warner has endorsed. In introducing Warner, Kaine called him a proudRepublican that was willing to cross party lines in order to put ?country first, especially on matters of national security.? ?That he could be my friend as a Democratic senator willing to offer me advice is just remarkable,? Kaine said. ?John Warner is the example of how [politics] can be done and how it should be done.? Virginia, a key battleground state in the general election, has seen the race tighten in recent months, withClinton 9-point advantage over Trump last month shrinking to 6 points in a recent Quinnipiac poll, 45 percent to 39 percent. ButKaine position on the ticket has helped keep the state from drifting further away from Clinton, andWarner support should help it further. ?He is someone who has always put country above politics,? said Mark Warner, who lost a Senate race to John Warner in 1996. Warner framed Kaine as a similar aisle-crossing politician, citing his push against the advice of Democratic leadership to try and force a debate over a congressional war declaration: ?He has been the one who said if he are going to send our men and women into combat, we need need to do our job.? Warner, 89, was the second-longest serving senator in Virginia history; he was succeeded in 2009 by Mark Warner. He was also secretary of the Navy during the Nixon administration.

"Trump suggests Tulsa officer was 'choking' in fatal shooting Donald Trump on Wednesday suggested that Oklahoma police officer Betty Shelby may have choked when she shot dead Terence Crutcher on the side of a highway last week in Tulsa. Speaking at a church in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, the Republican presidential nominee said, ""This young officer, I don't know what she was thinking. I don't know what she was thinking, but I'm very, very troubled by that. I'm very, very troubled by that. And we have to be very ? we have to be very careful."" Story Continued Below He added, ""Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, okay? They can't be doing what they're doing."" On Crutcher, he said, ""I watched the shooting in particular in Tulsa. And that man was hands up. That man went to the car, hands up, put his hand on the car. I mean, to me, it looked like he did everything you're supposed to do, and he looked like a really good man."" Trump called, via Twitter, for an ""immediate end"" to the unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, that broke out after a police shooting of a black man on Tuesday, the latest in a string of such fatal shootings that also included last week's shooting of Crutcher. ""Hopefully the violence & unrest in Charlotte will come to an immediate end. To those injured, get well soon. We need unity & leadership,"" Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning, also writing, ""The situations in Tulsa and Charlotte are tragic. We must come together to make America safe again."" Violent protests have rocked Charlotte in the past 24 hours, as demonstrators demand answers as to why Keith Lamont Scott was shot dead by police Tuesday night in a parking lot of an apartment complex. Police said Scott was holding a gun, while his family said he was sitting in his car reading a book. That shooting follows the fatal incident in Tulsa, in which Crutcher was shot dead by Shelby on the side of a highway, after she claimed he was behaving strangely and feared he was reaching for a weapon. Trump, who has positioned himself as the ""law and order candidate,"" has been criticized in the past for what some see as opportunistic reactions to tragic events. Last month, he sparked outrage when he tweeted in response to a Chicago shooting which killed Nykea Aldridge, Dwyane Wade's cousin. He was accused of being insensitive, and using the incident to further his political agenda, tweeting, ""Dwayne [sic] Wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!"" The Republican presidential nominee has, in recent weeks, been trying to appeal to black voters. Many denounced his comments Tuesday in Kenansville, North Carolina, when he said that black communities in the United States are ""in the worst shape ever."" He raised similar controversy last month in another appeal to black voters when he said ""what the hell do you have to lose?"" by trying something new like Trump. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who on Tuesday called Crutcher's shooting ""intolerable,"" also weighed in on Wednesday morning, tweeting, ""Keith Lamont Scott. Terence Crutcher.

"Teachers at a school in Texas might be armed and are willing to use whatever force needed to protect students, according to a sign posted outside the school district. Medina Independent School District placed a sign in front of one of its entrances Sept. 14 to warn people that teachers might be armed, reports CNN. ?Please be aware that the staff at Medina ISD may be armed and will use whatever force is necessary to protect our students,? the sign says. The warning serves as a good way to drive away potential threats, according to theschool superintendent. ?I think that anybody who might have a thought about harming someone in mind might think twice about it,? Superintendent Penny White said, according to KSAT 12. ?We?re 20 minutes or 25 minutes from Bandera.That our closest law enforcement.? White and Dr. James Lindstrom, a school board member, said no specific event spurred the sign, Lindstrom added it was posted due to the ?the general environment nationally.? Jillian Sides, a mother with two sons at the school, thought the sign was a good way to keep away threats. ?Schools have been a target for, for lack of a better word, crazy people, andI perfectly fine with it,? she told KSAT. Another mother disagreed, believing the sign could bring trouble. ?Idon know ifthat asking for trouble or not. I mean, you post a sign like that, it may bring trouble, unfortunately,? said Alisha Reagan, a mother of a third-grader. White would not name the teachers, if any, who are armed.

"Donald Trump interrupted Hillary Clinton 25 times in the first 26 minutes. He claimed she lacked the staminato serve as commander-in-chief. And when the question of his attitude towards women became an explicit topic of debate, he seemed to allude to resisting the urge to use herhusband marital infidelity against her. Trump has been aggressive and crude with male debate opponents, too, and he addressed the former Cabinet secretary by her proper title throughout the sparring. But, going up against the first woman to take to a debate stage as a major party nominee in American history, did Trump come across as sexist? Story Continued Below According to Vox, he interrupted her nearly once a minute for the first 26 minutes of the debate. By538 count, Trump seized the floor from Clinton three times and lodged 24 interjections as she spoke, a total of 27 interruptions. Clintondidn seize the floor from Trump once, and lodged only 5 interjections. The pro-Clinton American Bridge counted a total of 73 interruptions by Trump. The appearance of chauvinistic bullying can be deadly for a male politician debating a female opponent. Just ask Rick Lazio, who sunk his 2000 Senate bid against Clinton when he left his podium mid-debate in an attempt to force her to sign a campaign finance pledge. Trump has thrived by indulging his natural inclination towards aggression, but has also been tripped up on his attitude towards women and issues that matter to them ? like when Carly Fiorina confronted him for deriding the appearance of her face and when he was forced to walk back a statement that women should be punished for getting illegal abortions. And the risks for Trump are magnified. His opponents have consistently accused him of misogyny and his hopes in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania rest on suburban Republican women who are uneasy with the choice. After the debate, the Clinton campaignwasn touching the sexism question. ?He has so much wrong with his performance tonight that something like that didn't even enter my mind,? said press secretary Brian Fallon. But others saw unmistakable chauvinism inTrump approach. ?First of all the interruptions, he talked over her numerous times, the way he rolled hiseyes to me was indicative of the gender issue,? said former North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan, a Democrat. Trump himself seemed to sense a potential trap when moderator Lester Holt asked him to explain his prior comment that Clintondoesn have a presidential ?look.? He quickly pivoted away from her physical appearance. ?She doesn't have the look,? Trump responded. ?She doesn't have the stamina. I said she doesn't have the stamina, and I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.? Clinton shot back by citing her diplomatic forays to hundreds of countries and the 11 hours she spent before the House committee investigating the Benghazi killings. Then she knocked Trump for his treatment of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, saying, ?He called this woman Ms. Piggy. Then he called her Ms. Housekeeping, because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name.? Trump responded by saying, ?I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, ?I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice.?? After the debate, Trump confidant Rudy Giuliani said Trump was restraining himself from calling Clinton ?phony as a feminist.? ?This is the thing about Donald Trump is he has a big heart. He saw Chelsea in the audience, and hedidn say what he was ready to say,? said Giuliani. According to the former New York mayor, Trump was preparing to say, ?You take money from countries that stone women. You take money from countries that imprison women. You take money from countries where womencan drive. You take money ? not money, millions and hundreds of millions of dollars ? from countries that treat women as cattle. You attack Monica Lewinsky, saying that she was basically insane, when it turned out your husband basically violated an intern in Oval Office of the White House, disgraced the United States of America, and you were one of the primary attackers, and after your years with Bill Clinton, if youdon know that Monica Lewinsky was telling the truth thenyou not smart enough to be president.?Giuliani counterpunch aside, it was Trump who faced more post-debate scrutiny on gender issues. Republican women are crucial toTrump chances, and those watching the debate fell into two camps: Those who sensed sexism and those who felt gender dynamics were the least ofTrump problems on Monday night. Liz Mair, a Republican strategist who opposed Trump in the primary, said he came across as ?the kind of guy ever woman out there has rolled her eyes at and turned down flat at least a couples times in her life.? Katie Packer Gage, another Republican strategist who opposed Trump in the primary said that the unscripted environment brought out the impulses that caused Trump so much trouble before his recent streak of relative message discipline. ?He has such a long record of demeaning and disparaging and bullying women that this is just a reminder of so many things that have been kind of forgotten in the last week becausehe sort of learned how to behave in proper company whenhe scripted,? she said. But other Republican women saw it as a red herring. ?I thought it was many things but not sexist,? said conservative commentator Dana Loesch, a frequent Trump critic, of thebusinessman performance. ?I think a discussion of stamina with respect to any sex is fair game when the context is commander-in-chief.? ?For Trump standards, he was fairly subdued. At least hedidn call her fat and ugly and tell her her voice game him a headache,? zinged Republican commentator Ana Navarro, who has sparred with Trump this campaign season. To Sarah Isgur Flores,Fiorina deputy campaign manager, Trump treated Clinton the wayhe treated his male opponents. ?Hillary?s team would e making a mistake crying foul over Trump being Trump,? she said. ?It can only take away from her performance at this point.?Clinton performance aside, her face remained an object of analysis. While Trump resisted the invitation to weigh in again on her physical appearance, Fox News? Brit Hume filled that gap for him. ?The Trump expression was onewe all familiar with from the earlier debates ? he looked annoyed, put out, uncomfortable,? Hume said after the debate. ?And she looked, I think for the most part, she looked composed ? smug sometimes ? not necessarily attractive.?

"Hillary Clinton meets with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, right, at the Palace Hotel on Sept. 19 in New York City. | Getty Clinton press poolers clash with Egyptian leader's security NEW YORK ? Reporters traveling with Hillary Clinton got a taste of the Egyptian security state on Monday ? and they didn't much care for it. The Democratic presidential candidate was meeting Monday evening in New York City with Egypt's increasingly authoritarian president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Story Continued Below According to the press pool report, upon reaching the hotel, the journalists were ordered to leave their bags, phones and computers with campaign staff ""outside of the zone that had been deemed secure."" ""Reporters had to argue with Egyptian security to even carry recorders on their person,"" the pool report states. ""There were also repeated arguments between Clinton campaign staff and the Egyptian security officials about how many reporters could enter the meeting despite having already reached an agreement with thecountry protocol officer prior to our arrival."" Campaign staffers, as well as a Secret Service agent, were with the reporters the entire time. At one point, the journalists got stuck on an elevator with former Undersecretary of State Wendy Sherman, who now advises the Clinton campaign ? ""We all got cozy,"" the pool report states. Regardless of who they were with, the reporters went through multiple security sweeps and, at one point, ordered to wait behind a divider. ""Because of our positioning, we were unable to see HRC when she arrived, as previously noted, and without our phones wecouldn keep track of time,"" the pool report notes. Sisi, a former general, took power in Egypt in 2013 after massive popular protests forced out the elected government of Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Morsi. During his session with Clinton, which lasted more than an hour, Sisi at one point said he wished to talk ?about the path that we are taking in order to build up a new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law, that respects human rights and liberties."" But Sisi is increasingly viewed as a serial human rights violator. Clinton's decision to meet with him signifies the importance the U.S. places on its alliance with Egypt, a relatively stable country in a chaotic Middle East. But she's already drawn criticism from both liberals and conservatives for sitting down with Sisi.",0.047297297,0.013513513999999999,0.016891892,0.003378378,0.091216216,0.287162162,0.0067567569999999995,1,-1,1

"Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley has an 11-point advantage over his Democratic opponent, former Lt. Gov. Patty Judge. | AP Photo Incumbent senators lead challengers in Iowa, Colorado, Georgia Incumbent senators have healthy leads over their challengers in Iowa, Colorado and Georgia, according to a trio of Quinnipiac University polls of likely voters released Friday afternoon. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley has an 11-point advantage over former Lt. Gov. Patty Judge, 55 percent to 43 percent. Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet leads El Paso County Commissioner Darryl Glenn by 9 points, 52 percent to 43 percent. And Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson tops his opponent, Jim Barksdale, 55 percent to 34 percent. The polling results mirror the current presidential standing. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton holds a narrow advantage over Donald Trump in Colorado, where Bennet, a Democrat, also leads. Trump, however, has 6- and 7-point leads over Clinton in Iowa and Georgia, respectively. The surveys were conducted Sept. 13-21.

"2016 Clinton gets underTrump skin The Republican nominee loses his cool as a composed Clinton hits him on his business record, the Iraq war, and his secret Islamic State plan. HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. ? A composed Hillary Clinton got under DonaldTrump skin during their high-stakes showdown on Monday night, with the Republican nominee persistently interrupting Clinton as she needled him on his business record, the size of his fortune and his relationship with the truth. For 90 minutes at Hofstra University, Clinton and Trump clashed on style and specifics, disagreeing about foreign policy, economic plans and their readiness for the Oval Office. But for most of the evening, it was Clinton who was driving the agenda. She rattled off crisp prepared lines and repeatedly lured Trump into less politically favorable terrain, including a long discussion of why he was refusing to release his taxes. Story Continued Below ?First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is,? Clinton suggested. ?Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.? The much-hyped debate opened up with momentary niceties ? Trump called her ?Secretary Clinton, yes, is that okay?? ? and a friendly handshake that briefly masked the tension of aknife edge contest that is well within the margin of error in the most crucial swing states. And in an unprecedented moment for presidential politics, the Democratic nominee midway through the debate accused the Republican nominee of racism. ?He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior,? Clinton said, during an exchange onTrump years-long questioning of the American citizenship of President Barack Obama. Trump soon fired back with one of theevening most memorable lines. ?When you try to act holier than thou it reallydoesn work.? The exchange was emblematic of a debate not deep on substantive policy differences but full of attacks, with both candidates landing blows that will resonate with their established bases of support. ?I have a feeling that by the end of this evening I am going to be blamed for everything,? Clinton said with a smile. ?Why not?? Trump retorted. ?Just join the debate by saying more crazy things,? Clinton shot back. Clinton seemed to gain steam as the debate went on, hitting Trump in the closing minutes for his past attacks objectifyingwomen appearances. The former secretary of state often appeared relaxed as Trump scowled and tried to jump in during her answers. Clinton had prepared for weeks for the face-off with Trump, complete with briefing books and mock debates. Trump has eschewed such traditional preparation and, while he landed some of theevening most memorable lines, his performance was far more uneven. In one of thedebate tenser moments, Trump swiped atClinton recent time off the campaign trail when she came down with pneumonia and holed up for debate preparation. ?You decided to stay home and that's okay,? Trump said with more than a hint of sarcasm. ?I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,? Clinton said. ?And yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.? Under sustained attack, Trump did not have a meltdown, even as he misrepresented key elements on his record, including citing opposition to the war in Iraq despite the public record, and insisting that Clinton began raising questions ofObama citizenship. Asked about his judgement toward the end of the debate, Trump declared, ?I think my strongest asset, maybe by far is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not.? It was theevening most talked-about line both on Facebook and Twitter. Throughout, Trump stuck to knocking Clinton as a predictable, talking-point driven, lifelong politician. ?Typical politician. All talk. No action. Sounds good.Doesn work. Never gonna happen,? Trump said in a staccato summation of his debate plan. In the closing minutes, Trump summarized his appeal again. ?Hillary has experience,? Trump said. ?Butit bad experience.? The two candidates sniped about nearly everything from climate change to the economy to ISIS to trade to their records. One of the longest exchanges came not on tax policy ? butTrump refusal to release his taxes, breaking decades of precedent for presidential candidates. Trump got a rise out of the audience ? against thedebate ground rules of silence from the crowd -- by pledging to release his tax returns if Clinton releases all of the emails her staff deleted from the private email server she used as secretary of state. ?I will release my tax returns, against my lawyer's wishes, when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted,? Trump declared. ?So it's negotiable?? moderator Lester Holt asked, with Trump shooting back, ?It's not negotiable, no.? Clinton tried to turn the attack on her private email use back on Trump, who had previously said hewouldn release his tax returns until a routine audit is completed. ?I think you've just seen another example of bait and switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns,? Clinton said. Clinton tried to direct viewers to her website for real-time fact-checking of Trump. Trump directed viewers there, too, at one point. ?She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don't think General Douglas MaCarthur would like that too much,? Trump said of the 20thcentury general. ?At least I have a plan to fight ISIS,? Clinton said. ?No, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life,? Trump said about a group that has only existed for a few years. Trumpdidn just tangle with Clinton ? but with Holt. When Trump said, despite the public record, that he was opposed to the war in Iraq, Holt interjected ?The record shows otherwise,? Holt said. ?The record shows thatI right,? Trump said. Back and forth, they went. When Clinton finally got her turn, she exclaimed, ?Whew! Okay?? Clinton more than once made accusations that caused Trump to blurt out interruptions, referring to him only by his first name. ?Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis,? she said. ?That?s called business,? Trump jumped in. View The 10 most memorable moments of the presidential debate Here are the most memorable and important moments of the night from the first presidential debate at Hofstra University on Monday. ?Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it's real,? she said at another point. ?I did not say that,? Trump countered. ?I did not say that.? And when she hit him for his rhetoric about failing black communities, he sighed audibly. More than anything, Clinton sought to make the evening a referendum onTrump truthfulness, even as polls show the public have many questions about her own trustworthiness. ?Donald, I know you live in your own reality,? she said to Trump during an exchange about trade, ?but that is not the facts.? They went back and forth several times, but Clinton ultimately got the last word.",0.046538025,0.004540295,0.007945516,0.007945516,0.07037457400000001,0.311010216,0.002270148,2,-1,1

"Clowns are on a rampage along the east coast. Alleged sightings from Pennsylvania down to southern Georgia have parents worried about sending their kids to school. Schools have been closed or put on lockdown after alleged clown threats, including two Alabama schools. According to AL.com: ?Irondale [Alabama] police Officer James Lewis, a school resource officer, said a student reported to police that a Facebook post hinted at the possibility of clowns showing up on campus at Shades Valley High School. ?There was no threat,?

"Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani ripped into President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for being weak on terrorism. | Getty Giuliani accuses Obama and Clinton of 'dereliction of duty' in terror threat Rudy Giuliani on Wednesday ripped into President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for a ""dereliction of duty"" in their efforts to combat terrorism, while calling the Bush administration's failure to come to grips with the threat before the Sept. 11 attacks ""excusable."" Writing in USA Today , the former New York City mayor and current Donald Trump surrogate accused Obama and Clinton of investing ?too much time and energy into the narrative that there is no ongoing War on Terror.? Story Continued Below He argued that Obama and his former secretary of state had responded inadequately to the recent violence ? including the planted bombs in New York and New Jersey ? and underestimated the threat of terrorism to the country generally. ?Obama and Clinton continue to ignore the reality that a worldwide terror campaign is being deliberately executed by the very people they refuse to define: radical Islamic terrorists,? Giuliani wrote. ?Obama and Clinton's gut reaction is to tell the American people thatwe defeating the Islamic State terrorist group abroad while systematically downplaying connections between radical Islam and attackers in the United States and Europe.? While Clinton first urged officials to ?let this investigation unfold? after hearing reports of an explosion in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York on Saturday, Trump emphatically declared it a bomb and then boasted when authorities later confirmed the planted explosive devices. (Clinton, however, also made reference to ""bombings"" in her initial statements.) Republicans have also repeatedly criticized Obama for arguing against using the term ""radical Islamic terrorism"" for the Islamic State and its sympathizers. Clinton previously refrained from repeating the term, but has since used the words ""radical Islamism"" to describe the threat in the wake of the mass shooting in a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., in June. Also faulting its withdrawal of troops from Iraq and blaming the move for the rise of the Islamic State, Giuliani argued that the Obama administration fails to ?comprehend the threats before us today,? which he charged is a ?clear dereliction of duty.?

"Why Clinton IT Staff Took the 5th The illegal Clinton server issueisn going away. Although wedon have any definitive answers, we get closer every day. One question on the mind of many is why would the Clinton IT staff plead the 5th? Based on this report from the NY Post, we may have part of our answer: The FBI report noted there were many hacking attempts into the system, both while Clinton was secretary of state and afterward when Platte River Networks took over the administration of the home server. The agency said none had been successful, and it never named the hackers or their points of origin. But multiple internal Platte River e-mails reviewed by The Post show that computers in China tried on three occasions in 2014 to log intoClinton server and a computer in Russia tried once in 2013. The internal communications also revealed how the execs belatedly tightened security onClinton now-controversial home server and frantically sought to ?cover our asses? when news broke that the former secretary ofstate communications were deleted. ?Any chance you found an old e-mail with their directives to cut the backups back in Oct?-Feb? . . . If we had that e-mail, we are golden,? Platte River IT consultant Bill Thornton wrote to colleagues on Aug. 19, 2015. ?Wondering how we can sneak an e-mail in now after the fact asking them when they told us to cut the backups and have them confirm it for our records. Starting to think this whole thing really is covering up some shaddy s- -t.? Thornton and fellow Platte River specialist Paul Combetta refused to answer questions last week before a congressional committee probing the server scandal. Each cited his Fifth Amendment rights.

"""The more information that provides clarity, hopefully the greater the calm will be,"" the Republican senator said. | AP Photo Tim Scott: Release of Charlotte video could ease tensions Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) on Thursday said that the release of video footage from the killing by police of Keith Lamont Scott might ease tensions in Charlotte, North Carolina. ?If we had a body camera on the officer, there is no question that we would have greater clarity going forward to what actually happened,? he said in an interview withCNN Jake Tapper. Story Continued Below ""I'm not a law enforcement officer, so I'm not going to pretend to understand their concept of releasing the video,"" Scott said. ""We've seen different agencies do it in different times. The release of the video can help defuse some of the tensions if the video is helpful."" ""The faster the information comes to the surface, the quicker we get clarity, hopefully there will be a calming influence,"" Scott added. ""But there is never a reason for violence in response to a situation. Violence for violence only begets more violence. This is the wrong direction and the wrong path.? Keith Lamont Scott was shot dead by police outside his apartment complex in Charlotte, North Carolina. Police were pursuing an arrest warrant for another person when they encountered Scott, who was African American, in his car.

"You can choose one or more of the explanations for what has happened to Hillary Clinton in recent weeks as Donald Trump has closed in on her in the polls. The fundamentalsof thisyear and politicaldata pointed to a close race for more than a year; Trump has (until his recent birther nonsense) offered a more temperate version of himself; Clinton has been haunted by her emails and her health; Republican holdouts have been returning to the fold, another sign that the electorate will vote more and more along lines of party preference. But what is especially bedeviling the Clinton campaign is that, at least until now, constituencies most critical to her campaign seem to have no sense of urgency about keeping the Donald Trump out of the White House. While Hispanics, who backed Obama in 2012 by a more than 2-1 margin, support Clinton by a similar margin, they seem far less inclined to vote than they did four years ago. Story Continued Below That is what could change now that Trump threatens to actually take the White House. Younger voters, who not only backed Obama by landslide margins but turned out in record percentages in 2012, have until now expressed relative indifference to the campaign or have turned to the alternatives: Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and the GreenParty Jill Stein. If lastweek Quinnipiac poll is right, the race among 18-to-34-year-olds looks like a four-way split: She wins only 31 percent toTrump 26 percent. In fact, Johnson runs second, with 29 percent; Stein, running in low single digits nationally, pulls in 15 percent of 18-to-34 year olds. And remember: without massive support and a heavy turnout among younger voters,Obama margins in Florida and other key states would have been wiped out. Yes, support for minor party candidates tend to fall when the leaves do; yes, the Clinton campaign has a get-out-the-vote machine whosereputationuntested formidable. But what may be their most powerful weapon is the clear possibility that Trump could win, which is whyClinton very bad few weeks could, in the end, be very good for her.Trump climbing numbers could finally motivate her complacent Democratic base and other voters who have never been crazy about her and not especially motivated to come out to the polls, especially if she were running away with the race. Here is where Hillary Clinton might think about channeling the arguments of two historical figures you might not normally think of in the same paragraph: Oliver Cromwell and John McEnroe. Back in 1650, the first (and last) non-royal ruler of Britain tried to dissuade the Scots from declaring Charles II as king. Saying, in a famous appeal: ?I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, consider it possible that you may be mistaken.? Three hundred and eighty one years later, in the midst of another British field ofbattle?John McEnroe saw one of his serves ruled a fault and screamed incredulously: ?You cannot be serious!? Somewhere between Cromwell and McEnroe lies the Clintoncampaign most plausible argument to its wavering voters: Get real, folks. ?You?re looking at Johnson and Stein as a way of rejecting a corrupt, unresponsive two-party system,?England Lord Protector might say to millennials, sounding a lot like Bernie Sanders, ?becausethere no difference between the two parties. But please be willing to consider that you might be mistaken. Look back 16 years, and see what a similarvote RalphNader. His 94,000 voters in Florida would have wound up giving Gore a net of about 20,000votes than enough to make butterfly ballots and hanging chads irrelevant. Now, between launching the Iraq War and the two Supreme Court justices Bush appointed, did it really make no difference??McEnroe and sounding remarkably like Elizabeth Warren,who now out there stumping forHillary then chime in: ?You cannot be serious if you think you have the luxury of a protestvote for Johnson or Stein. If you vote as a Libertarian for Johnson, you will materially increase the chances of a Trump presidency. Look at the list of potential judges. On everything from gay rights to abortion to his own views of the First Amendment, Trump is on record as rejecting core libertarian principles. If you vote for Jill Stein as a progressive, you are helping to put in power a president whose tax plan makes the rich richer, who thinks climate chance is a hoax, who wants to abolish whole swaths of environmental protection laws. So voting for Johnson or Stein meansyou voting for alabel ?libertarian,? or a ?progressive??without realizing that the consequence of that vote could lead to a president who rejects everything you claim to hold dear.?There no guarantee that any of these arguments will work. They come, after all, at the end of a 15-month-long Trump campaign that was guaranteed to collapse at countless moments (I?d list them, but anyone following this campaign has likely committed them to memory). And it still requires, as its ultimate point, an insistence that these voters summon themselves to vote for a candidate for whom they have little or no enthusiasm.Obama supporters turned out in significant numbers because they were hungry and saw in his presidency a feast; the voters Clinton must summon are being told ?eat your peas because you have to.?That an emotional detachment that a dozen speeches heavy on policy, like the one she delivered Monday,won repair. Of course,it possible thatTrump own character and temperament, revealed on the debate stage or in his bizarre-world campaign appearances, will convince voters that in the end , he is a risk they are not prepared to take. But for voters unsure about Clinton, relying on Trump to self-destruct after what he has survived is a risk they cannot take. So, even though the Scottish Presbyterians rejectedCromwell plea, and even though the officials at Wimbledon did not change their call, their pleas still suggest thatTrump rise in the polls could be a powerful argument for Clinton.

"As Donald Trump courted African-American voters in Cleveland on Wednesday at a town hall taped by Fox News to air Thursday evening, he seemed to express support for establishing the stop and frisk policing policy on a national level. Interested in Donald Trump? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest When asked by an audience member how he would stop violence in the black community, Trump responded, ""I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive, and you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically."" He added, ""New York City was incredible, the way that worked, so I think that could be one step you could do."" The law enforcement policy ? in which police officers stop and question pedestrians regardless of whether they believe a crime has been committed, then search the pedestrians if the officers suspect violations ? has been extremely controversial, particularly in communities of color, and has been the subject of several legal challenges alleging racial profiling and discrimination. The policy gained prominence in the 1990s under New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton and Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is now a close confidant of Trump's. Trump previously expressed his support for the policy, praising Giuliani for its success in New York. Trump has as of late also been an ardent supporter of profiling regarding immigration, believing it is a helpful tactic in stopping terrorism. He has drawn the ire of some African-Americans not only for praising stop and frisk but also for painting a grim portrait of black life. On Tuesday night, Trump said, ""Our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before, ever, ever, ever"" ? seeming not to take into account slavery, institutional segregation or the often violent reactions in the civil rights movement. On Thursday morning, however, in an interview on ""Fox & Friends,"" he sought to amend his position, saying he never meant to suggest that stop and frisk should be implemented nationally. ""Now Chicago is out of control. I was referring to Chicago with stop and frisk,"" Trump said. His initial answer came in response to a question that did not mention Chicago, though Trump cited the city in a previous answer as a place that is ""out of control."" Of course, as president, Trump would not be able to unilaterally implement the policy in a single city; he would have to defer to local officials and law enforcement. During a press conference, the members of the Congressional Black Caucus were asked about Trump's stop-and-frisk remarks. ""The notion that stop and frisk had anything to do with the improving public safety numbers in New York is ludicrous, and Donald trump needs to check his facts,"" said Rep.

"It was a busy weekend for miscreant Islamist scum operating under the imprimatur of the international socialist-Islamist axis within America. On Saturday, Ahmad Khan Rahami, a New Jersey resident and naturalized immigrant from Afghanistan, detonated multiple bombs in New York and New Jersey. No one was killed, but nearly 30 people were injured. Rahami was apprehended three days later in Linden, New Jersey, after a gun battle with police. Also on Saturday, 22-year-old Dahir Adan, a Somali Muslim who had been living in the United States for the past 15 years, stabbed nine people at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota. According to St. Cloud Police Chief William Blair Anderson, Adan ?who was disguised as a security guard at the time of the attacks ? ?reportedly made references to Allah during the attack and asked at least one person whether they were Muslim.? Dahir was killed by police at the scene. According to the New York Times, Rahami, the man arrested for the New York and New Jersey bombings, became a ?completely different person? after a trip to Afghanistan, when it is presumed he became ?radicalized,? a term used by the press and politicos to describe a Muslim who crosses that obscure line from Islamic to militant Islamist. It has also been reported that Rahami made several other trips to Pakistan and Afghanistan without being detected by the U.S. government.Rahami father, Mohammed Rahami, told the press this week that he had reported his son to the FBI as a potential terrorist in 2014, but the agency took no action. While the Rahami and Adan stories have received wide press coverage, of course we are still being subjected to the usual spin and politically correct propaganda from the press and politicians, which deftly avoids the motive attendant to these attacks ? this being that the perpetrators were Muslims and were acting based on Islamic doctrine. At this point,we now seen several high-profile acts of domestic terrorism perpetrated by Muslims wherein communities and law enforcement agencies were previously made aware of the danger posed by these individuals. In all of these cases, nothing was done to mitigate the potential danger. In the case of federal law enforcement, to some extent it stands to reason that organizations such as the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security might be less motivated to counter these threats, since these are under the control of the Obama administration, whose agenda includes destabilizing America through an influx of potentially violent Muslims and the establishment of insular Muslim communities. In a speech to the United Nations this week, our bath house refugee-playing statesman president, Barack Hussein Obama, defended increasing globalization and condemned the populist nationalism that has been growing in the West in direct response to the actions of murderous Muslim ?migr?s and refugees. This deportment, which has included the Obama administration illegally facilitating the importation of tens of thousands of Muslims from unstable, culturally bankrupt Islamic nations, has also given rise to such debacles as the 858 people who, according to a new Department of Homeland Security inspectorgeneral report, were mistakenlygranted citizenship due to a failure of the federalgovernment fingerprint records system, despite having been ordered deported. This is eerily reminiscent of the jihadi training camps known to exist across the continental U.S., but which law enforcement is prohibited from engaging because the Islamist groups operating them somewhat conveniently did not make it onto the federalgovernment official list of terrorist organizations. Tragically, this international socialist-Islamist axis of Western elites even includes powerful religious leaders such as Pope Francis, who regularly condemns ?hateful acts of terrorism? with one breath while admonishing Europeans to ?welcome refugees into your homes and communities? (the same refugees who are rioting and raping their way across that continent) with the next. With regard to the United States, this is a component of the agenda calculated to render America irrelevant as a nation of influence on the world stage. The Islamists seek global supremacy for their foul doctrine, while the socialists harbor attitudes varying from those which hold that the concept of nations itself is outmoded, to those which characterize the U.S. as last among the old-school imperialist oppressor nations that must be dismantled. A chief stratagem of the latter is of course the idea that racism practiced by those of northern European descent has been the greatest evil of the last thousand years.

"HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. ? Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are counting down the hours to their first debate, a heavily hyped and critical encounter that comes as a fresh batch of polls show the race narrowing to a virtual dead heat. The showdown is expected to be a study in contrasts: Clinton, the longtime politician and consummate preparer who has pored over briefing materials in recent weeks, versus Trump, a first-time political candidate who, if aides are to be believed, has eschewed many elements of traditional debate preparation ahead of what could be the most watched political event in U.S history. Story Continued Below The two candidates arrive at Hofstra University in an increasingly taut race, asClinton once-comfortable lead in August has evaporated into aknife edge contest well within the margin of error in the most crucial swing states. ?A wheel-to-wheel race,?Trump running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, called it in a radio interview with Hugh Hewitt earlier on Monday. Trump and Clinton face two fundamentally different questions headed into Monday night. For Trump: Can the celebrity candidate best known only a few short years ago as the star of ?The Apprentice? demonstrate the gravitas necessary for voters to envision him in the Oval Office? For Clinton: Can a woman who has been in the public spotlight for more than two decades ? as first lady, senator and secretary of state ? ease theelectorate lingering questions about her trustworthiness? ?This debate will have a huge impact,? predicted Judd Gregg, a Republican who played Al Gore and John Kerry in President George W.Bush mock debate preparations. Because Trump and Clinton enter the debate with historically high unfavorability ratings, Gregg said, ?I think the person who wins this debate is the candidate who is able to increase their likeability and, at the same time, is able to have Americans see them as a leader who will take the country in a positive direction.? TV networks are expecting record audiences with countdown clocks ticking down the hours and minutes in recent days.Clinton campaign has prepared for two different Trumps to show up at Hofstra, her aides have said. The first is the insult-throwing bombastic showman who rampaged through Republican primaries. The second is the more controlled and sober candidate who has appeared on the campaign trail of late, someone who might even make a magnanimous gesture toward Clinton on the debate stage. Trump has stayed more disciplined with the help of teleprompters at his rallies and by not subjecting himself to tough questioning in recent weeks, bypassing formal press conferences for 60 days and, for the most part, avoiding extensive interviews with outlets other than Fox News. Neither of those are options on Monday night. But Mari Maseng Will, a longtime GOP debate coach, said Trump has been so outlandish on the campaign trail for the past 15 months that the typical bar for what counts as misbehaving on the debate stage is unusually high for him. ?A sighwouldn do it,? she said, referring toGore now-infamous exasperation with Bush in the 2000 debates. ?The only thing he could do to turn away people? would be mean,? she said. ?That?s a killer in American politics, even for him.? Trump successfully navigated 11 Republican primary debates, but he never had to face one of his opponents one-on-one. Indeed, the smallest crowd he competed against was three other candidates, meaning he will have to fill nearly double the amount of time he ever has before on Monday. That could prove a challenge for a candidate who has mastered the quick sound bite and quip but lacks the depth of knowledge on policy that Clinton has. The debate will last for 90 minutes with no bathroom or commercial breaks. In the hours leading up to the debate, the Clinton and Trump camps sparred less about each other and more about the role of moderator Lester Holt, an NBC anchor. Clinton backers urged Holt to fact-check Trump, whose misrepresentations on the campaign trail have far outnumberedClinton. ?We are concerned that Donald Trump may lie, he may throw misinformation out there, and that Hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish,? Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said on CBS on Monday Kellyanne Conway,Trump campaign manager, complained aboutClinton ?very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs.? But such pre-game spin and expectations-management end at 9 p.m. eastern. Then the bright lights will shine on Clinton and Trump alone.",0.024714829,0.003802281,0.007604563000000001,0.017110266000000002,0.047528517,0.266159696,0.005703422,2,-1,1

"It?s no wonder Trump is losing ? and losing badly ? with women. A new poll from McClatchy-Marist shows Clinton leading Trump by 24 points among registered female voters (58 percent to 34 percent), and 23 points among likely female voters. Remember, Mitt Romney lost the female vote by 11 points, and John McCain by 13 points. While the Trump campaign and his supporters scratch their heads as to whyhe performing so poorly with the demographic that makes up the majority of the country, the Clinton campaign is reminding them why. A new (and brutal) ad has just been released from the Clinton camp. Asking voters if Trump is ?the president we want for our daughters?? the ad, titled Mirrors, uses theDonald deplorable, sexist, offensive and objectifying words against women against him. From, ?I?d look her right in that ugly face of hers,? to ?A personwho flat-chested is very hard for them to be a 10,? Mirrors showcases women all across the country looking at themselves ? their bodies, appearance ? at their phones, wondering if they are worthy, asTrump disgusting words echo off the screen. When talking about Kim Kardashian, Trump thought it would be a good idea to talk about her famous asset: ?Does she have a good body? No. Does she have a fat ass? Absolutely.? So presidential. The most damning part comes at the end, when Howard Stern asks Trump, ?So you treat women with respect??Trump answer? ?No, Ican say that either.? This ad is so powerful. Trump, who is well known to be a serial misogynist, sexist, and all around pig, should be ashamed of the way he regards women, their appearances, and livelihoods.

"Story highlights The senators warn that it could be a repeat of history The implications for the increase in processing applications can be controversial ahead of the election Washington (CNN) Two Republican senators are expressing concern to the head of the Department of Homeland Security over what they said was a ""rush"" to process new citizens ahead of the presidential election. In the letter to Jeh Johnson, Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin specifically suggest that new voters could provide Democrats with an advantage. They refer to an internal agency email from US Citizenship and Immigration Services about processing applications ""due to the election year."" The memo encourages DHS staff to work overtime to process applications and notes several Saturdays that offices will be open to help process applications. The senators say a similar effort in 1996 to increase citizenship applications ""endangered national security and public safety"" because not all the cases were processed following the correct protocol, such as fingerprint checks. The Department of Homeland Security said it aims to ensure naturalization applications are processed on time. ""USCIS's goal is to process applications for naturalization within five to seven months, regardless of external events such as elections. USCIS uses statistical forecasting models to plan for the potential increased volume of work. USCIS anticipated that there would be a spike in applications this year, as we usually see in an election year, but the increase ... has exceeded expectations,"" Homeland Security said in a statement.

" Legendary Washington Post journalist Carl Bernstein went on CNN with Brian Stelter in the aptly named ?Reliable Sources? program, when the host asked one of the least important questions on the campaign trail today ? yet another inquiry into Democratic nominee HillaryClinton health.Bernstein response was perfect: There is a much larger question about the overall coverage of this campaign by the electronic media, by cable and network news.We been terrific at interpretation at giving equal time to debate panels, butwe been positively awful in terms of reporting in a coherent way the biggest story of this campaign: the real existing life and records of Donald Trump. The New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal have done fabulous reporting on this and we give snippets of it.We need to be doing an hour, two hours a night of real biography, running it over and over of whatTrump life and record have been about becausethey at absolute odds with the mythical and lying story that he has told us.He a con man.It been established. And also he has presided over a cover up of his own life. And we have allowed it in cable news and network news particularly. Few journalists in America today are more respected than Carl Bernstein and his colleague Bob Woodward, whose doggedly persistent journalism uncovered the last time Republicans broke into the Democratic National Committee for political reasons, and ultimately forced President Richard Nixon to resign from office in 1974 amidst the Watergate affair. Unlike the 1970s, this time we found out the results of the Russian invasion into DNC email servers almost immediately. Then the Republican candidate departed from all norms of political behavior by any party in America to ask his patron,Russian strongman Vladimir Putin to hack Democratic candidate HillaryClinton campaign servers, leading almost immediately to another electronic strike. The real question is: whyhasn the cable television media noticed any of this and taken the time to dig further into the detailed reports, like proof that the Republican candidate faces serious racketeering charges related to Trump University, that long before the suspected labor and immigration violating Trump Models lawsuit, we found evidence of human trafficking practices in thenominee reality TV show productions for MTV? Every major newspaper in Florida is calling for a federal investigation of Trump University, but thus far CNN and FOX are more interested in HillaryClinton health and ignoring the actual facts that Donald Trump is 70 years old, lied about his height to hide his obesity, and says that making hand gestures during rallies is ?exercise.?CNN Stelter replied to CarlBernstein sincere comment with the kind of misguided mainstream media groupthink talking points whichmight come straight out of acampaign deflection and spin files, blaming the reality ofTrump lifelong con job being under reported on liberalswanting to discuss facts. Bernstein shut him down without question:It not just liberals, I thinkit conservatives, too, there is realization that trump is a con man. And that that is a big part of the story. Look, we have reported and nobody has been tougher on Hillary Clinton especially on the server question than I,I saidit indefensible what she did with it, and we have reported on her whole life. She has been around for 25, 30 years in public on the public stage. And we know her every position and record and her life. Trump is different. Wehaven ?it not equal.It disequal that we have allowed Donald Trump to play us like this and we focus on his outrageous statements which we do every day and we give equal time to those on his side andHillary side debating these crazy statements and positions that he changes every day. And we analyze that, but do we go back and look at his whole business record? No. Wedon.It sad to watch CNN drown in the effluvia ofit own conflicted interests, while broadcasting a Trump hotel infomercial live, and without during the hourlong advertisement for the Republican bigot mention that all of its contents were not made in the USA by the xenophobic candidate who advocates protectionism and charges $805 a night to stay in half-finished digs a few blocks from the White House, nor did CNN mention thatTrump hotel chain is wallowing in vacancy because of the stigma attached to its name.

"Donald Trump's surrogates and leading supporters on Sunday were pushing a narrative that the Republican candidate started two days earlier when he declared that Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign ""started the birther controversy,"" meaning the false notion that President Obama was born outside the United States. Interested in Elections? Add Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest On CBS News? Face the Nation on Sunday, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway pushed the claim that so-called ""birtherism"" began with the Clinton 2008 campaign by invoking the words of former Clinton campaign manager Patti Sollis Doyle. ?Even Patti Solis Doyle, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign manager in 2008 ... until she was fired by Hillary Clinton, admitted on Friday ... that she said, yes, these are her words: There was a volunteer in Iowa who was pushing this,? Conway said. Sollis Doyle, in an interview on CNN, said a volunteer coordinator had forwarded an email promoting the birther conspiracy. But she said that person was immediately fired and that the birther conspiracy theory was never promoted by Clinton herself. Conway also mentioned a memo circulated by Mark Penn when he was chief strategist forClinton 2008 campaign that talked aboutObama lack of American roots. Penn wrote a memo in 2007 saying thatObama foreign background could present a weakness for him and that Clinton should emphasize her middle-class Midwestern upbringing. ""His roots to American values and culture are at best limited,"" the memo says. ""I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and values."" But it does not say that Obama was foreign-born. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a prominent Trump supporter, also invoked SollisDoyle comments and then downplayed Trump's role in promoting the idea that Obama wasn't born in the U.S. ""It's not true that he kept it up for five years,? Christie said onCNN ?State of the Union.? ?It wasn't like he was talking about it on a regular basis."" Similarly, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus in an interview on ""Face the Nation"" said he thinks the ""birther"" movement ""was something that got started in the 2008 presidential campaign ... By the preponderance of evidence before us, Hillary Clinton, or her campaign, were definitely involved in this issue."" Trump himself gave a short statement on Friday morning, at an event under the glittering chandeliers of his newest hotel, in an attempt to reverse his long-held assertion that there is uncertainty surrounding the location of President Obama's birth. ?Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean. President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period,? the Republican presidential nominee said. Trump's statement Friday came just a day after he refused to acknowledge to the Washington Post that Obama was born in the U.S. And for years, Trump had helped perpetuate conspiracy theories about whether the first black president is wholly American and in fact born in Hawaii -- as his public birth certificate says, an attack many, including Clinton, have said is racially charged. In an August 2013 interview with ABC News' Jon Karl, for example, Trump stood behind his push to reveal Obama's ""true birth status."" Karl asked, ""You don't acknowledge that you went overboard on this whole birther stuff?"" Trump replied, ""Actually, I think it made me very popular, if you want to know the truth, OK? So I do think I know what I'm doing.""",0.052287582,0.008714597,0.004357298,0.004357298,0.080610022,0.265795207,0.0,2,-1,1

At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful ? andthat when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.? Meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, ?oh, absolutely.? Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street. ?Itwasn a gunshot,? she told us. ?It was much louder. Itwasn a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ?They just shot him? and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters whohadn already left, exited.? At that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters. It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ?entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.? CNN reports, ?Police say the person was shot by a civilian.? The City of Charlotte began spinning theprotester grave injuries immediately on Twitter: ALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. ? City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016 Two additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlottepolice claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist. ?I saw the man go down on the pavement,? said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, ?It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.? Lastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook ? which was also shared via twitter ? that, ?within 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.? When African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how ? with more violence.

"With just 50 days until the election, Donald Trump is facing a staggering ? and perhaps historic ? organizational disadvantage. According to a POLITICO review of campaign spending, Hillary Clinton has invested seven times the amount of money on TV commercials as her Republican rival and has established twice as many field offices in many of the states that will decide who wins the presidency. In many battlegrounds, she has dozens more organizers than Trump. Story Continued Below While Trump, a first-time politician who has surrounded himself with advisers who are new to the rigors of presidential campaigns, has made serious headway in a number of battlegrounds in recent days, his on-the-ground and in-the-air deficits could be what stands between him and 270 electoral votes. ?We?re in completely untested waters,? said David Kochel, an Iowa-based Republican operative who is leading a study group at the Harvard Institute of Politics contrasting the traditional campaign approach adopted by Clinton with the non-traditional one being used by Trump. ?There has never been such a wide disparity in resource allocation as we're seeing in 2016.? The question, though, may be whetherTrump lack of infrastructure matters in an election cycle that has so far rewarded a low-budget approach built on free media and mass rallies rather than TV ads and door-knocking. Last week, Smart Media Group, a media buying firm that works with the Republican National Committee, sent an email to a group of top Trump advisers, including campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, TV ad maker Larry Weitzner, and senior communications adviser Jason Miller, briefing them on the latest in commercial spending. The numbers were startling. As of Sept. 12, the email noted, Trump had spent $17 million on TV ads, a small fraction of the $126 million Clinton had invested. When outside groups were added to the mix,Trump deficit was even greater -- $33 million toClinton $244 million. Trump aides say the figures reflect a simple reality: Their funds are limited. Through the end of July, Clinton and her outside group allies had raised a combined $435 million toTrump $160 million ? a difference of more than two-to-one, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Unlike Clinton, a powerful fundraiser, Trump has struggled to attract the support of deep-pocketed donors, many of whom have been repelled by his candidacy. Those working for pro-Trump super PACs are racing to find a solution. Advisers to one of the groups, Rebuilding America Now, are openly discussing the possibility that Rick Scott, the wealthy Florida governor who is chairing the super PAC, may soon provide it with a contribution. Clinton has used her TV barrage to cast her Republican opponent as a dangerous, unpredictable figurewho ill-suited suited to occupy the Oval Office. Last week, while Trump aired commercials in just four states, Clinton had spots running in nine battlegrounds. One Clinton ad that went into heavy rotation, titled ?Sacrifice,? spotlighted critical comments Trump made about Arizona Sen. JohnMcCain war record. Strategists from both parties say they cannot recall the last time a presidential nominee has been so dominated on the TV airwaves. The seven-to-one ratio confronting Trump far eclipses the five-to-four margin President Barack Obama faced in 2012 and the two-to-one ratio McCain encountered in 2008. With early voting in some battlegrounds opening in just days, the race is entering its most intense phase yet. And while Clinton has established formidable operations in many key states, Trump has far fewer full-time staffers to get out the vote, according to figures provided by campaign aides, national party officials, and swing-state operatives. In must-win Ohio, where early voting begins on Oct. 12, Clinton has around 250 organizers and 50 offices. Trump, meanwhile, has roughly 110 staffers and 30 offices. Republicans say Gov. JohnKasich persistent refusal to endorse Trump has hurt the nominee, depriving him of man-power. Many ofKasich longest-serving aides, including Jeffrey Polesovsky and Jai Chabria, have decided to sit on the sidelines. Chabria, a former Kasich senior adviser, said Trump was behind in a state where appealing to low-propensity voters was a weeks-long process thatcouldn be done overnight. ?It?s a very late effort by the Trump folks to play catch up, and the Democrats and the Clinton campaign have been here for a long time.That going to have an effect,? he said. ?Big rallies are really nice, but actual campaigns matter in Ohio.? In North Carolina, where Trump has around 170 staffers and 10 offices, Clinton has over 250 workers and 30 offices. Democrats say they are implementing a detailed plan aimed at intensifying turnout among black and college-educated voters, demographic groups that Trump has struggled with. Last month, Clinton brought aboard Dan Kanninen, who played a key role in BarackObama 2008 and 2012 campaigns, to help oversee her campaign in the state. In New Hampshire,it a similar story. While Trump has fewer than 50 full-time organizers and just a handful of offices, Clinton has around 100 staffers and 25 offices. ?Two months out, I think Hillary has a stronger operation than Trump up here.That pretty apparent from the number of staff, the number of offices, and the number commercials,? said Jim Merrill, a veteran Republican strategist who oversaw MarcoRubio primary bid in New Hampshire and held similar positions on MittRomney two presidential campaigns. ?Trump is behind where we were in 2012.? In even conservative bastions, Clinton is developing formidable infrastructure. In Arizona, Clinton has around 160 staffers and 25 offices, and in Georgia she has roughly 40 organizers and 10 offices. In that state, Tracey Lewis, who worked on Michelle Nunn's 2014 Georgia Senate bid, recently signed on as a senior advisor. Republicans declined to detail their numbers in the two conservative states but acknowledged that Clinton had a bigger field presence. While Trump advisers concedethey behind in the ground war, they insistthey making serious gains. The campaign, for example, said it had improved its footing in Florida after engineering a recent staff shuffle. State director Karen Giorno,who clashed with many members of the Trump team, was replaced with Susie Wiles, a former top adviser to Scott, the Florida governor. Yet in an electionthat so far been driven by daily headlines, some are wondering if textbook campaign metrics like TV ads and field staffers will matter as much as they have in previous years. Some are coming to the conclusion that the New Yorkbusinessman lack of swing-state infrastructure might not be fatal. Throughout his campaign, Trump has invested relatively little on TV ads and field deployment ? instead surviving off his ability to pack rallies and generate overwhelming media attention for speeches and statements large and small. On Thursday morning, during a meeting convened byTrump congressional supporters on Capitol Hill, Conway said the Republican nominee would give multiple addresses each week focusing on specific policieshe implement as president. ?The fact that the numbers have moved gradually inTrump favor in spite of the onslaught of spending by Hillary causes a lot of head-scratching,? said Kochel, who was chief strategist on JebBush presidential campaign. ?But the voters are getting their information in a thousand different ways outside of the campaigns? control.?",0.02247191,0.002247191,0.002247191,0.011235955,0.034831461,0.23595505600000002,0.002247191,2,-1,1
" The Senate reconvened this week as Democrats introduced a transparency in Presidential candidates bill that would force Donald Trump to release his tax returns, if Republicans would only be willing to face everything their racist nominee has done in his business career: Democrats are backing legislation from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns within 15 days of receiving theparty nomination. It would also require the FEC would release the documents after 30 days, if a candidate did not. ?We?re going to be here next week.We probably going to have some downtime,? Sen.Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told reporters. ?There?s no reason wecouldn vote.? Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and her husband the former President Bill Clinton have both disclosed over 30 years worth of tax returns, and all of the ClintonFoundation returns too. In fact, since 1976 only one candidate has refused to release tax returns, and in that election Republican Gerald Ford kept his taxes secret, and left the Oval Office after losing to Democrat Jimmy Carter. In the 2012 election, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid voraciously and publicly called out Republican nominee Mitt Romney for only releasing two years of tax returns, saying that he was hiding his returns for over a decade and that the candidate had paid a very low or no tax on his income whatsoever. He was right! But America only found out just one week before the election, long after the start of early voting and absentee ballot mailing, when Bloomberg News published a definitive article onRomney taxes, which showed a huge income and no tax paid, validating theDemocrat numerous public statements. According to The Hill: Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who has called out the GOP presidential nominee nearly every day recently, added Thursday that Trump is ?ethically compromised? and the ?king of the welfare kings.? Ironically,Romney father George Romney was a Republican candidate for President before him, and started the tradition of American politicians disclosing their financial details when running to become Commander in Chief. American voters deserve to knowwhat inside Republican nominee DonaldTrump tax returns, to make the most informed votes possible. Because we all know every last detail about Democratic nominee HillaryClinton finances and personal history, but outside of lying, racism and narcissistic self-love, the orange-faced one is still a mystery.

"President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are holding what is expected to be their final meeting as heads of government onWednesday there is every reason to expect that this one in New York, at the United Nations General Assembly, will be as fruitless as previous encounters. It is no secret that U.S.-Israel relations have become volatile and tense over the past eight years, with Obama and Netanyahu sparring over Israeli settlements and the all-but-moribund peace process,Iran nuclear program, and the uprisings of the Arab Spring. But the likelihood of a sputtering end to the Barack-and-Bibi relationship does lead one to ask: Which of the two candidates who are running to replace Obama nextJanuary Clinton or DonaldTrump do somewhat better in restoring the U.S.-Israel relationship and pushing for peace? Story Continued Below Trump surrogate and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani claimed at the Republican convention that Netanyahu and other government ministers favored Trump. Our sources say the Israeli security cabinet is divided but on the whole views Clinton as the safer course. There is, in any event, no doubt that the governing Likud Party has become closely aligned with Republicans in recent years, and that Netanyahu was betting on a Mitt Romney victory four years ago. ?The notion that theydon intervene in our politics and wedon intervene in theirs is pure nonsense,? as Aaron David Miller, a Middle East negotiator for successive U.S. administrations, has put it. ?Netanyahu has clearly made his preferences clear on the Republican side.? But Netanyahu is himself often second-guessed byIsrael national security elites. And the answer to the question of who really would be better for a future U.S.-Israel alliance, a President Clinton or a President Trump, requires starting with a more basic issue: What does it mean to be a good ally to Israel? The current Israeli government seems to think that a good American ally would stop nagging Jerusalem about West Bank settlements, forget about the Israel-Palestine peace process, provide a blank check for security assistance, use military force in the region more readily, tear up the nuclear deal with Iran, and also supply weapons for Israel to strike Iran unilaterally if it thought it was necessary at some point. Hillary Clinton certainly would not follow this agenda to the letter; in that sense, her administration might well share some ofObama priorities. She clearly values the U.S.-Israel alliance highly, she is committed toIsrael security, and she has credibly promised to fend off diplomatic efforts that Israelis see as delegitimizingthe Jewish state whether at the U.N., through sanctions, boycotts or punitive disinvestment. At the same time, she has confirmed that the peace process and a two-state solution will be central to her Israel policies. And she promises to safeguard, not tear up, the nuclear deal with Iran. Safeguarding means holding Iran to its terms and being prepared, as Obama promised in spring 2012, to use military force if needed to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Many Israelis deridedObamacommitment, in our view. ButClinton credibility regarding the use of force should not be in doubt. On balance, we think, she would be a better president in the long run for Israel.Here why. If Jerusalem hopes for an American president to renege on the nuclear deal, Trump may well be their man. He has certainly bragged about his history of walking away from agreements. What happens then, however, is a question for which Trump has no convincing answer. Some of his advisers point to RichardNixon madmantheory of how to frighten rivals with the unpredictability of American leadership. But Nixon, whatever his other faults, was a shrewd geo-strategist (and he had Henry Kissinger by his side). Trump, judging by his erratic and impulsive behavior on just about any given day of this campaign, seems far too close to the madman template foranyonecomfort of all a small Middle Eastern state that depends on a steadiness of commitment from its American protector. Steadiness is one of the last words that come to mind when thinking aboutTrump various statements about Israel and the Palestinians. He could embrace something resembling neutrality and demand a return on U.S.assistance Trump foreign policythemes, alternatively, as he put it, he could be ""the most pro-Israel president ever.? This uncertainty about his instincts does not bode well for alliance management. Indeed, his innate isolationism and nativist demagoguery portend two kinds of trouble for U.S. relations with Israel. First, Trump would enter office as the only genuinely isolationist president since the 19thcentury unsettling prospect for Israel, which depends heavily on U.S. internationalism (and an experience that Israel, which is only 68 years old, has never had). Although not, as a rule, philosophically inclined, Trump has expressed a coherent view of international relations as fiercely transactional and zero sum. This view extends to alliances, as he made clear in a New York Times interview in which he explicitly disavowedAmerica Article 5 guarantee to defend NATO allies including Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. ?If we cannot be properly reimbursed for the tremendous cost of our military protecting other countries, and in many cases the countriesI talking about are extremely rich ? Then yes, I would be absolutely prepared to tell those countries, 'Congratulations, you will be defending yourself.?? In the world according to Trump, alliances such as NATO are inherently bad arrangements for the United States because the country is defending European allies who have little capacity to reciprocate, and who are unwilling to adequately pay for their protection. Likewise, maintaining a nuclear umbrella over South Korea and Japan seems to be a foolish and dangerous entanglement when those countries could just as well develop and deploy nuclear weapons themselves. And, of course, isolationismis a mild term for what Trump conceives as the proper relationship between the U.S. and its southern neighbor. Perhaps Trump will make an exception to his expectation of a ?return on investment? for commitment to allies, and he will stand by Israel no matter what it can or cannot do for the U.S. in return. If so, however, it would be out of character. Second,Trump invective against Muslims and other immigrant communities might appear in sync with Israeli hard-liners?the GOP nominee has indeed pointed toIsrael security barrier and security profiling of Muslims as models for his own Great Wall on the Mexican border and promised ban on Muslims entering the country. But ifIsrael government really prefers Trump on this basis, this will drive another wedge between Israel and American Jews. Most American Jews are politically liberal, and they are particularly allergic to fear-mongering rhetoric against minorities. The experience of millennia has taught them that security for diaspora communities depends on a general climate of liberal tolerance. When demagogues single out minorities, Jews have to askthemselves we next? So, to take a small but telling example, when Trump has said that ?my Jews??presumably hisemployees to say ?Merry Christmas,? and implies that his presidency will usher in a new era in which ?Happy Holidays? will be a euphemism of the past, American Jews are not amused. The fact is, the U.S.-Israel alliance needs to be nurtured for the long haul, which means facing up to its real problems and reinforcing its moral foundations. It is wrong to think that the problems between Obama and Netanyahu have been determined by the personalities of the two leaders. Generational transformation on both sides has deepened strategic differences over the best way to manage a fragile regional balance of power, Palestinian political aspirations, and the increasingly anarchic conditions in the region. Israel is becoming more religious and less democratic. The United States is becoming morediverse, after all, is whatTrump followers are angryabout, arguably, more liberal. Surveys of young Israeli Jews show a sharp decline in support ofIsrael identity as a democratic state, from 26.1 percent in 1998 to 14.3 percent today. The growing religious nationalist population is becoming increasingly powerful in Israeli politics and society, including the Israel Defense Force. In 1990, 2.5 percent of officer candidates self-identified as religious, compared with 26 percent in 2008. Young Americans, in contrast, are more liberal than their parents on matters related to Israel-Palestine. A recent Pew Survey indicated that 57 percent of self-styled ?liberal Democrats? sympathized with Palestinians more thanIsrael a time when younger Democrats are more and more likely to call themselves liberal. Politics in both countries appear to be tracking these trends. Last May, Netanyahu fired Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon for defending a seniorofficer right to criticize the government. Rather than seek to shore up his coalition by replacing him with a center-left figure, Netanyahu opted for the far-right wing Avigdor Lieberman as defense minister, creating what Israeli columnist Nahum Barnea has called ?the most radical government ? in Israeli history.? Meanwhile, as Guiliani has contended, it may well be right that the DemocraticParty leftward movement could bring additional tensions to relations with Israel. Bernie Sanders supporters on the Democratic Platform Committee failed in the effort to include language more harshly critical of the Israel occupation of the West Bank. There is little doubt, however, that this represented the views of many of his younger supporters. *** What can be done to revive the U.S.-Israel relationship, under either a President Clinton or President Trump? In our recent book on U.S.-Israel relations, we suggest that one approach would be to negotiate a formal alliance enshrined in a treaty that would specify mutual responsibilities. The U.S. would undertake a legally binding commitment to defend Israel from attack, particularly by Iran. Although the White House has already declared this commitment publicly, a solemn treaty obligation would inject it with greater credibility in Iranian as well as Israeli eyes. To underscore the depth of obligation, the U.S. could deploy a tripwireforce it long did in the Asia andEurope ensure thatIsrael adversaries understood that an attack on Israel would be tantamount to one on Americans that would bring the United States into any military conflict. In return, Israel would agree to a final status accord with the Palestinians along the territorial lines that the U.S. has long endorsed: the 1967 borders with mutually agreed swaps. The U.S., working closely with Israel and Jordan, would not only help secure the parties? safety, but work with European donors to put the new Palestinian state on a firm footing to reduce the possibility of revanchist violence. Under this arrangement, the U.S. would contemplate a military assistance package that came closer toIsrael vision for the one that has just been signed, whileIsrael withdrawal from the West Bank would ensure robust trade ties with Europe well into the future. Many on both sides will say that this program entails too many risks for too uncertain a gain. Israelis for whom past is prologue will argue that the practical benefits of a treaty is available at no cost. It certainlydoesn fit with DonaldTrump purely transactional view of international relations. But in an increasingly violent Middle East, it behooves both countries to reconsecrate a relationship based on a shared moral and strategic vision. As a matter of moral temperament and strategic vision, Hillary Clinton would appear far more likely to make this happen.

"Trump takes credit for 'bomb' call: 'I should be a newscaster' The Republican nominee accuses the media of unfairly attacking him. Donald Trump on Monday morning claimed credit for accurately calling theweekend explosion in Manhattan a bombing, even before full details were in, as the Republican presidential nominee attempts to exploit the latest terror threats to boost his campaign. Trump slammed the media for attacking him over his early use of the bomb term and accused them of editing out clips of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton using a similar term. (CNN came under fire for using a clip of Hillary Clinton that axed her reference to the bombings, the first response from her gaggle with reporters Saturday.) Story Continued Below ?If you saw her in the back of the plane ? and she used the word bombsalso, by the way. I heard ? Ididn see it ? but I heard I was criticized for calling it correctly,? Trump told ?Fox and Friends? in a telephone interview. ?But what I said was exactly correct. I should be a newscaster because I called it before the news.? Trump claimed everybodyhas said that he was right but ?called it too soon.? ?OK, give me a break,? he continued. ?But Hillary Clinton used the word bombsshortly thereafter and nobody said anything about it. And somebody said some of them edit that word out. They took it out. Hey, folks,it a rigged system, andI been saying it for a long time. And the news is as dishonest as anybody there is.? Trump told supporters at a rally in Colorado Springs, Colorado, on Saturday night that ?a bomb went off,? a remark that preceded public confirmation from local officials as they responded to an explosion that injured 29 people. ?Just before I got off the plane, a bomb went off in New York, and nobody knows exactlywhat going on, but boy, we are living in a time,? he said Saturday. Clinton, however, did the same thing, all the while attacking her opponent for his untimely assessment. Speaking to reporters aboard her campaign plane Saturday evening, Clinton said that she had been briefed ?about the bombings in New York and New Jersey and the attack in Minnesota.? Despite using a similar term as Trump, though, the former secretary of state dinged her rival just moments later. ?I think it's important to know the facts about any incident like this,? she said. ?I think it's always wiser to wait until you have information before making conclusions because we are just in the beginning stages of trying to determine what happened.? The real estate mogul suggested the media were attacking him not because he cited the explosion as a bombing before it was confirmed but because polls are tightening. National polls released last week by Fox News and CBS News/New York Times show a tight race between both candidates in a head-to-head, with Trump leading by 1 percentage point in the Fox News poll but trailing by 2 percentage points in the CBS News/New York Times survey. ?The reason is because my poll numbers now are so good thatthey so worried,? he said. Respondents to the Fox News poll narrowly favor Clinton as the candidate they think would perform better on the terrorism and national security front, 47 percent to 46 percent. Terrorism has punctuated the presidential campaign, with domestic and international attacks striking areas including San Bernardino, California; Orlando, Florida; and Paris and Nice, France. The attacks, at times, have yielded very different responses from the candidates trying to convince Americans that they can best handle these threats as commander in chief. Clinton has tried to position herself as the steady hand America needs, while Trump has portrayed himself as a strong leader who will obliterate terror threats.Clinton responses to such incidents are usually much more cautious and measured thanTrump, who is often criticized for his actions in the wake of terror attacks. Case in point: Following the domestic attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando, Trump proposed a temporary ban on Muslims that he has since modulated and triumphantly tweeted that he is appreciative of ?the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism.? On Monday, he seemingly recommended profiling, arguing that law enforcement officials ?know who a lot of these people are? but ?don?t wanna be accused of profiling and theydon wanna be accused of all sorts of things.? ?Wedon wanna do any profiling,? Trump said. ?If somebody looks likehe got a massive bomb on his back, wewon go up to that person and say, ?I?m sorry,? because if he looks like he comes from that part of the world,we not allowed to profile. Give me a break.?",0.039927405,0.007259528,0.00907441,0.00907441,0.072595281,0.346642468,0.016333938,2,-1,1
"""There is only one choice when we elect a president in November: Hillary Clinton,? the newspaper's editorial board writes. | Getty Cincinnati Enquirer bucks tradition, endorses Democrat Clinton The Cincinnati Enquirer, which by its own admission has backed Republican candidates for president ?for almost a century,? is endorsing Hillary Clinton for president. ?Presidential elections should be aboutwho the best candidate, notwho the least flawed. Unfortunately,that not the case this year,? thenewspaper editorial board wrote in its endorsement, published Friday. ?Our country needs calm, thoughtful leadership to deal with the challenges we face at home and abroad. We need a leader who will bring out the best in all Americans, not the worst.? Story Continued Below ?That?s why there is only one choice when we elect a president in November: Hillary Clinton.? The Enquirer is not the first newspaper to buck a long tradition of endorsing GOP candidates in favor of Clinton. Earlier this month, The Dallas Morning News endorsed the former secretary ofstate White House bid, making her the first Democrat that newspaper has endorsed in over 75 years. And other newspaper editorial boards, some of which have a long history of supporting Republican presidential nominees, have broken for Clinton in 2016. In addition to the Enquirer and the Morning News, the editorial boards of the New York Daily News and the Houston Chronicle also switched to the Democratic nominee this time. (The New York Daily News endorsed Barack Obama in 2008.) The Richmond Times-Dispatch and the New Hampshire Union-Leader, both of which backed Romney four years ago, have opted to go with Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson instead. Several swing-state newspapers that backed Romney have also withheld an endorsement to this point, although some did not endorse until October in 2012. Those newspapers include the Arizona Republic, the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, the Orlando Sentinel, the Sun-Sentinel (Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.), the Columbus Dispatch, the Detroit News, the Grand Rapids Press, the Des Moines Register, the Florida Times-Union and the Wisconsin State Journal. In its endorsement, the Enquirer called Clinton ?a known commodity with a proven track record of governing.? The newspaper praised her willingness to work with Republicans as a senator and her efforts to assist first responders suffering health problems resulting from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. It also lauded her work on theChildren Health Insurance Program as first lady and her support for LGBT rights and efforts to close the pay gap between men and women. Trump, by contrast, poses a ?a clear and present danger to our country,? theEnquirer editorial board wrote, and lacks any experience in governance and foreign policy. That so many military and national security have refused to back the GOP nominee ?speaks volumes? about what type of president he would be, the newspaper said. ?His wild threats to blow Iranian ships out of the water if they make rude gestures at U.S. ships is just the type of reckless, cowboy diplomacy Americans should fear from a Trump presidency,? thenewspaper endorsement said. ?Do we really want someone in charge of our military and nuclear codes who has an impulse control problem?? TheEnquirer endorsement of Clinton was not without reservation, however. While it complimented her as a ?competent secretary of state,? it also said ?mistakes were made in Benghazi, and it was tragic that four Americans lost their lives in the 2012 terror attacks on the U.S. consulate there.? But the newspaper dismissed the concerns that many Republicans have aboutClinton involvement, or lack thereof, in the attack: ?The incident was never the diabolical conspiracy that Republicans wanted us to believe, and Clinton was absolved of blame after lengthy investigations.?Clinton ?refusal to acknowledge her poor judgment in using a private email server and mishandling classified information is troubling,? the newspaper wrote, as is her ?lack of transparency,? evidenced by her recently-snapped streak of 275 days without holding a press conference. But the Enquirer was far more damning of Trump, who the newspaper slammed for backing the so-called birthermovement and feuding publicly with the parents of a Muslim soldier who was killed in 2004 in Iraq.Trump private sector acumen has created jobs, the newspaper admitted, but has also sent jobs overseas and left some who did business with him unpaid. The editorial questioned if Trump makes as much money as he says he does or if he has paid his fair share of taxes, questions the newspaper said have gone unanswered because the Manhattan billionaire has thus far refused to release his tax returns. That Trump has toned down his rhetoric is recent weeks failed to impress theeditorial authors. ?But going two weeks without saying something misogynistic, racist or xenophobic is hardly a qualification for the most important job in the world,? the editorial read. ?Why should anyone believe that a Trump presidency would look markedly different from his offensive, erratic, stance-shifting presidential campaign?? ?Hillary Clinton has her faults, certainly, but she has spent a lifetime working to improve the lives of Americans both inside and outside of Washington,? it continued. ?It's time to elect the first female U.S. president ? not because she's a woman, but because she's hands-down the most qualified choice.?

"Obama warns against strongman governments Making his case against nationalistic and anti-immigration movements that have grown both in the U.S. and around the globe, President Barack Obama told the United Nations general assembly Tuesday that ?today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself.?Obama remark appeared to be an allusion to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has campaigned hard against thepresident record and has pledged to build a wall alongAmerica southern border with Mexico. In his final address as president before the United Nations general assembly, Obama was critical of the isolationist movement that Trump has championed in the U.S. and others have pushed abroad. Story Continued Below ?As these real problems have been neglected, alternative visions of the world have pressed forward, both in the wealthiest countries and in the poorest,? Obama said after discussing economic inequality and other international issues. ?Religious fundamentalism, the politics of ethnicity or tribe or sect, aggressive nationalism, a crude populism, sometimes from the far left but more often from the far right, which seeks to restore what they believe was a better, simpler age free of outside contamination. We cannot dismiss these visions. They are powerful. They reflect dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens. ? ?Today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself,? the president continued. ?So the answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration. Instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such integration are broadly shared.? The president led his speech with a celebration of global accomplishments to which the U.S. has been party during his administration, listing the reduction of terrorists? safe havens, the landmark nuclear agreement with Iran and the resumption of diplomatic relations with Cuba as successes. But Obama also listed global problems like the flow of refugees, continued financial disruptions, and a lack of basic order and security in the Middle East. The president urged the international community ?that we must go forwards and not backwards,? offering a defense of Western values as the best path forward for global growth and success. ?I believe that as imperfect as they are, the principles of open markets and accountable governance, of democracy and human rights and international law that we have forged remain the firmest foundation for human progress in this century,? Obama said. ?I make this argument not based on theory or ideology but on facts.? In making that case, Obama warned against strongman governments and oppressive tactics like media suppression. He said such strategies are stifling for economies hungry for information and ultimately lead to further crackdowns or the scapegoating of foreign enemies that can lead to war. Speaking specifically of the Middle East, Obama called for the recognition of a ?common humanity? that would serve as a stepping stone toward resolving the various conflicts in the region. Again attacking isolationism, Obama said the rest of the world cannot turn its back on conflict in the Middle East in the hope that violence will be contained to the region. ?Until basic questions are answered about how communities coexist, the embers of extremism will continue to burn, countless human beings will suffer, most of all in that region, but extremism will continue to be exported overseas,? he said. ?And the world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall and prevent it from affecting our own societies.?",0.028350515,0.0,0.005154639,0.015463918,0.051546392,0.36855670100000004,0.010309278,2,-1,1
"DonaldTrump presidential campaign has paid his family's businesses more than $8.2 million, according to a POLITICO analysis of campaign finance filings, which reveals an integrated business and political operation without precedent in national politics. The GOP presidentialnominee campaign has paid his various businesses for services including rent for his campaign offices ($1.3 million), food and facilities for events and meetings ($544,000) and payroll for Trump corporate staffers ($333,000) who helped with everything from his traveling security to hiswife convention speech. Story Continued Below In all, the Trumpcampaign payments to Trump-owned businesses account for about 7 percent of its $119 million spending total, the analysis found.That an unprecedented amount of self-dealing in federal politics. Even the wealthiest of candidates have refrained from tapping their businesses? resources to such an extensive degree, either because their businesses are structured in a manner thatdoesn legally allow them to do it with flexibility, or becausethey leery of the allegations of pocket-padding that inevitably arise when politicians use their campaigns or committees to pay their businesses or families . Trump, on the other hand, appears to have structured his businesses in a way that lets the campaign use them without legal restriction. And he certainlydoesn appear to feel any embarrassment about flouting political norms that typically compel candidates to distance themselves from their businesses during campaigns. Quite to the contrary, Trump ? who in 2000 predicted ?I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it? ? has used the campaign itself as a marketing platform to promote everything from the difficult-to-find Trump Steaks to his golf courses and a new Washington hotel.Trump tangle of businesses has raised concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest should he win the presidency, while the Trump-branded campaign has drawn mockery and allegations of pocket-padding fromTrump critics. His Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in July accused Trump of ?spending his meager campaign resources on ? himself.? In a statement, the Trump campaign said: ""Mr. Trump has largely self-funded his campaign and continues to make significant contributions which far exceed the amounts the campaign is required to pay. The campaign has used known quantities as far as event space, air travel and accommodations, and has fulfilled all FEC requirements throughout the campaign.? The degree to which Trump or his corporations may be benefiting from his campaign is unclear, partly because the financial and legal structures of his businesses ? and their relationships with his campaign ? remain opaque. Trump has stubbornly refused to release his taxes, which could shed light on the issue. Additionally, thecampaign payments to Trump-owned businesses are dwarfed by the $54 million Trump has pumped into his campaign. In fact, reports filed with the Federal Election Commission show that more than $500,000 in services such as rent, software and staff from Trump-owned businesses were donated to the campaign ? including some of the salary paid toTrump head of security Keith Schiller , who travels everywhere with the candidate. In those situations, Trump likely either wrote off the cost of services rendered by his companies to his campaign, or he personally reimbursed the campaign for the costs of the services. While federal election law prohibits corporations from donating cash, goods or services to campaigns, the regulations do include an exception ? andit the one that election law experts interviewed for this story say Trump is most likely using. It allows people who own certain types of companies ? including LLCs or sole proprietorships ? to donate from those entities to campaigns and have those donations be considered to have come from the person.It unclear precisely howTrump various businesses are structured, but he likely would have to be the sole owner of the ones that are donating services to the campaign in order for those donations to pass legal muster. ?Most wealthy candidates separate their businesses from their campaign organizations, andthat partly because their companies are either publicly owned or owned by multiple people,? said GOP election lawyer Jason Torchinsky. He represented RudyGiuliani 2008 presidential campaign, which paid the former New Yorkmayor companies for office space, security and legal consulting, but finished the campaign owing money to them. ?It?s unique to have somebody who is independently wealthy and is able to so thoroughly integrate a privately held company into their campaign,? Torchinsky said of Trump. Regardless of howTrump corporate entities are structured, the campaign is legally required to charge them fair-market rates for goods or services received, even if Trump ultimately writes off the bills as donations. There have been allegations that the campaign failed to payTrump companies fair-market value for some services, including for the Trump corporate staffer who helped write Melania Trump's convention speech (the campaign paid her $356.01 through Trump Tower Commercial LLC), and the corporate lawyer who penned threatening letters to a donor and PAC supporting Jeb Bush. Among the goods and services that Trump has paid his companies for are $34,500 for lodging and event staging at Trump National Doral golf course, $48,200 for room rental and catering from the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester, N.Y., and $142,000 to Trump Restaurants for rent, utilities, meals and office supplies. It paid more than $1 million to Trump Tower to rent office space for its main campaign headquarters. Trump Ice, his bottled water company, got $1,300, while his son Eric Trump's Virginia winery was paid almost $5,000 for catering and event space. The bulk of the spending, almost $6 million, went to a company called TAG Air for use ofTrump private plane. The campaign has also paid $432,000 to Mar-a-Lago,Trump club in Palm Beach, Fla., for lodging, facility rental and catering. And Trump continues to simultaneously use and promote facilities he owns, even sometimes using misdirection to do so. One ofTrump primary election victory speeches in March, held at Mar-a-Lago, was widely lampooned as an infomercial for Trump-branded steaks, water, magazines and wine. And last week, he lured the political press corp to his new Washington hotel by promising a revelation about his longstanding allegations that President Obama was born overseas, which he finally disavowed. Before getting to that, though, he took the opportunity to promote the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in the Old Post Office. Whatever the campaign paid to use the ballroom in the Old Post Office that daywon be disclosed until nextmonth FEC report. But back in January, the campaign spent $5,000 to rent space in the hotel. During a March tour of the hotel , Trump boasted to the press that the hotel would have ?one of the biggest ballrooms in Washington, and by far the most luxurious ballroom."" He also quipped that the completion of the hotel would mean he will wind up with a presence on Pennsylvania Avenue ?one way or the other.""",0.016129031999999998,0.00248139,0.0074441690000000005,0.016129031999999998,0.024813896000000002,0.21588089300000002,0.0,2,-1,1

"Hillary Clinton tops the field with 43 percent support to Donald Trump's 37 percent. | AP Photo Clinton leads Trump by 6 points in nationwide poll Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump nationally by 6 percentage points among likely voters, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday afternoon. In a four-way race that includes Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein, Clinton tops the field with 43 support. Trump follows at 37 percent, while Johnson and Stein trail at 9 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Story Continued Below In a head-to-head between the two major party nominees,Clinton lead expands to 7 percentage points, 48 percent to 41 percent. Four percent of respondents said they would not vote for president, while 3 percent said they were undecided. Among registered voters, a majority of support for Clinton is just that ? support for Clinton (as opposed to support against Trump). Half of the registered voters backing Clinton said their vote is more for Clinton, while 44 percent characterized it as more against Trump. On the Republican side, only 41 percent of registered voters said their vote is for Trump (51 percent said it was against Clinton). Registered voters gave Trump the edge as the candidate who would be best in dealing with the economy, but they favored Clinton when it came to dealing with immigration, changing the country for the better, being a good commander in chief and handling nuclear weapons. Both candidates virtually tied on the issue of terrorism and national security, with Clinton claiming a narrow 1-point advantage.

Interested in Elections? Add Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Here's a look at who the candidates invited to sit in the audience at tonight's debate. Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton's campaign this morning released a partial list of guests invited by the Democratic presidential nominee to the debate at Hofstra University in New York. The four women on the list are all supporters who have developed a special relationship with Clinton over the years. They include a 9/11 survivor; a single mom and domestic abuse survivor; and a woman who became a pen pal to Clinton when she was the first lady. The list also includes Anastasia Somoza -- a woman with cerebral palsy who was recently featured in a campaign attack ad about Donald Trump's mocking of a disabled reporter. Most notably, the Clinton campaign has also given Dallas Mavericks owner and Trump antagonist Mark Cuban a front-row ticket for the show. Chelsea Clinton is also expected to attend, according to a spokeswoman for the former first daughter. And, the Clinton camp said this morning it is hosting 1,200 debate-watch parties across all 50 states tonight. Clinton's running mate Tim Kaine will attend a watch party in Orlando, Florida, organized by the Human Rights Campaign. Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, will also attend that event, an aide said. Donald Trump This morning, reports emerged that the Republican nominee invited Mark Geist, one of the survivors of the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, to attend the debate. Geist has been vocal in his support of Trump's candidacy; he spoke on the first night of the Republican National Convention alongside fellow security contractor John Tiegen about the attack in Benghazi. Trump also over the weekend fired off a tweet about a possible guest to the debate. After Mark Cuban posted about his plans to attend the event in support of Clinton, Trump tweeted Saturday: ?If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him!?

" As Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton prepare to square off Monday night in their first debate, the expectations are clear: Political bloodsport in primetime. The 2016 race has been notably nasty, with Trump assuming the attack dog role campaigns have traditionally outsourced to running mates and surly surrogates. Clinton too has shown a willingness to blitz Trump -- though in less graphic terms -- during speeches and interviews on the trail. But does the current election season represent a new low in American politics? History says no -- and a group of historians interviewed by CNN agree. Exhibit A: ""That hideous hermaphroditical character, which has neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman."" Exhibit B: ""Around him, as the candidate for the highest office in the gift of the people, the most corrupt, the most designing and the most dangerous of the community rally."" Exhibit C: ""We are Republicans, and don't propose to leave our party and identify ourselves with the party whose antecedents have been rum, Romanism, and rebellion."" Presidential candidates, their campaigns and supporters have been slinging mud since the Founding Fathers were jockeying for power in the aftermath of the revolution. The contests of the 19th century routinely descended into cesspools of public deviance, racism, and religious and personal slander. ""The machinations, the backstabbing, the hideous caricatures and slurs were just devastating,"" historian Joan Waugh told CNN. ""It was a bloodsport,"" she said. ""I have to laugh, when I'm not weeping, at the utter abysmal ignorance of the way that politics and the history of politics is often reported. As if nothing today has ever happened before."" 1800: 'That hideous hermaphroditical character' Republican President Thomas Jefferson and his predecessor, Federalist President John Adams The first race of the new century was a rematch of the 1796 contest, pitting President John Adams, a Federalist, against Thomas Jefferson. In American politics in those early days, the parties were less important and the candidates didn't campaign much in person, mostly allowing partisan allies and hired hands to do the dirty work. And there was none more foul than Jeffersonian hatchet man James T. Callender. In a pamphlet titled, ""The Prospect Before Us,"" the Scottish immigrant described Adams as a ""hideous hermaphroditical character, which has neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman."" (For his trouble, Callender would eventually be convicted of violating the Sedition Act and jailed, only to be freed when Jefferson took office.) Candidates in this era operated under both social and statutory constraints. It was considered unseemly to seek votes or speak ill of the opposition. And the Sedition Act made it illegal to write or print anything ""malicious"" about the government -- especially its President. ""Famously, when a guy in a bar, half-drunk, said that John Adams had a fat ass -- which is also factually true -- the guy was put in jail,"" Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Edward J. Larson told CNN. ""So you had to watch what you said directly about Adams. You could get away with saying anything you wanted about others in the Federalist party."" While the Jeffersonians feared Adams was fixing to dispense with the American experiment in favor of something like the British monarchy, the Federalists were equally convinced that Jefferson would effectively open the borders to foreign radicals and clamp down on religion. As one Massachusetts newspaper put it, electing ""the infidel Jefferson"" would mean ""our churches will be prostrated, and some infamous prostitute, under the title of the Goddess of Reason, will preside in the Sanctuaries now devoted to the worship of the Most High."" Of course, none of it was true. ""Jefferson was not an atheist,"" Larson explained. In fact, the Virginian and Adams ""had almost identical religious viewpoints. They were both Unitarians. Adams' religious viewpoints were almost indistinguishable from Jefferson's and they knew that. They had been close friends."" Their relationship would last another quarter century, until they died on the same day -- July 4, 1826. 1828: 'The skunks of party slander' Andrew Jackson and his wife, Rachel. She would die before his inauguration. In the first -- but not final -- American campaign drama widely considered to have sent one of its central characters to an early grave, another incumbent Adams was defeated in an electoral rematch from four years earlier. Like in 1800, the 1824 contest had gone to the House of Representatives. John Quincy Adams fared better than his father, winning the presidency over Andrew Jackson by obtaining the support of House Speaker Henry Clay in what opponents called the ""corrupt bargain"" -- Adams would name Clay his secretary of state. This did not sit well with Jackson, a hard-bitten man who was orphaned as a teen and made his name in combat against the British and then by leading a violent campaign against Native American tribes. He would spend the next four years plotting his revenge. ""The campaign of 1828 was very nasty, a campaign in which supporters of Andrew Jackson called John Quincy Adams a 'pimp' (the rumor, started by Jackson allies, was that Adams during his time as the US minister to Russia had provided female companionship for the czar) and supporters of John Quincy called Jackson and his wife 'polygamists' because they had married before her divorce came through,"" said CNN presidential historian Tim Naftali.

MUST WATCH Adams attacks Jackson with spelling bee? 01:30 Kerwin Swint, an author and professor at Kennesaw State University, recalled it being particularly hard on the Jackson family. ""Andrew Jackson's mother was caricatured as a common prostitute that the sailors brought over for the benefit of the English Navy,"" he said, while Jackson himself ""was called a murderer, a traitor, and mentally unstable."" Adams dismissed the vile tone of the campaign, chalking up the slurs to those ""skunks of party slander."" The President, though, was not so high-minded that his associates didn't accuse Jackson of being illiterate, while mocking his poor spelling skills and keeping up attacks on his wife, Rachel. The harsh spotlight wore on her and, as many historians agree and Jackson then believed, probably had a hand in killing her. ""I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God than live in that palace in Washington,"" she is said to have told friends as the campaign turned ugly. Rachel Jackson died on Dec. 22, 1828 , likely of a heart attack. She would be buried on Christmas Eve, before her husband's inauguration.

Her tombstone at the Hermitage , Jackson's home in Nashville, read in part: ""A being so gentle, and yet so virtuous, slander might wound but could not dishonour."" 1860: 'Stephen in search of his mother' Abraham Lincoln and Steven A. Douglas square off in a cartoon titled, ""The undecided political prize fight"" (1860) ""At political rallies in (Abraham) Lincoln's era, people got drunk, they had fist fights, they threw excrement, they attacked horses, they screamed and shouted and cursed -- did I mention they drank; they drank a lot -- and it was not exactly a festive atmosphere,"" the historian and Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer told CNN. ""It was a scary atmosphere."" In the years before the public flocked to see heavyweights in the ring or on the gridiron, many would bring their booze and off-hours aggressions to campaign rallies -- drunken parades and parties that made little mention of the candidates, who rarely if ever attended. Lincoln in particular steered clear of the trail, as outright campaigning was still considered unbecoming of a future chief executive. So when one of the four candidates in the 1860 race, the Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, announced he was going to travel from Chicago to New Hampshire, by way of New Orleans, to visit his sick mother, political opponents and the partisan press drew their daggers. ""Douglas made a speech every time the train stopped for water and coal,"" Holzer said. And for that, ""he was mocked brutally as a momma's boy, as 'little Steven in search of his mother,' insulting his independence, his manhood, making him look like a pipsqueak -- which he was -- so he was personally assailed."" The broader sweep of the 1860 campaign was much darker. Conspiracy theories and race hate were the prevailing the themes in a four-way showdown that left the Democratic Party in shambles and cleared the way for the first shots of the Civil War just a few months later. The table had been set by a Supreme Court decision three years earlier, in 1857's Dred Scott decision, when it declared that African Americans could not be US citizens. The ruling aggravated tensions between the northern and southern states, leading many to believe that, as Holzer put it, ""Douglas was in cahoots with President James Buchanan and Chief Justice Taney to make slavery legal, national, and perpetual."" This was not quite true. Douglas despised Buchanan and considered the Scott decision a political misstep. But Honest Abe knew how to throw an elbow and seized on anxieties in the north over a federal government conspiring to expand slavery across the continent. Douglas tried to turn the tables, as Holzer explained, by saying ""that Lincoln wants whites to be able to marry blacks, blacks to serve on juries, blacks to have equal rights, blacks to have the vote, blacks to have white servants and all these things that are supposed to send shivers of horror into the white community."" The four main 1860 candidates are mocked in a cartoon with racist imagery titled, ""The political quadrille. Music by Dred Scott"" (1860) The political cartoons of the day helped stoke the fiction. Appearing mostly on pamphlets and in saloon windows, they were often crude and deeply racist. In one titled ""The political quadrille: Music by Dred Scott"" (above), all four candidates danced with their perceived objects of their interest -- Lincoln with a black woman, John C. Breckinridge with President Buchanan (or ""Buck"" the goat here), Douglas with an Irishman and Constitutional Union party candidate John Bell, with a Native American, suggesting that he is a Nativist, or anti-immigrant. Lincoln would rout all three, winning the presidency with 1.87 million votes, nearly 500,000 better than the runner-up Douglas. But less than two months after the election, South Carolina voted to secede from the union. Six more states would follow before Lincoln was sworn in as the 16th president of a rapidly dissolving United States on March 4, 1861. 1872: 'The Home Stretch' Ulysses S. Grant and the newspaperman and 1872 Liberal Republican presidential nominee, Horace Greeley. The second post-Civil War election pitted President Ulysses S. Grant against a challenger from within his own party: the audacious abolitionist and New York Tribune publisher Horace Greeley. The 1872 campaign turned on the fight over Reconstruction in the South and with the Democratic party still hopelessly divided, the Liberal Republicans -- a breakaway GOP group that favored amnesty for erstwhile Confederates -- formed the base of the electoral opposition. But as the campaign neared, they faced one minor hurdle: no one wanted their nomination. Enter Greeley, ""a very strange and eccentric figure"" by historian Waugh's account. ""He always wore this long white waistcoat and his hair was a mess."" ""He was no one's idea of their standard-bearer,"" Waugh added, but that he would be -- and with it, the target of relentless attacks by his former friends and the cartoonist Thomas Nast. Greeley became a figure of fun early on, and unflattering caricatures, in essay or cartoon form, followed him throughout the campaign. The press behaved like a band of cruel teenagers, wondering aloud -- as in one Evening Post editorial -- ""how many men are there of character and reputation who may be counted among his friends? If there be any at all, they are very few -- so few that it is difficult to recall their names."" Rallying around him instead, the piece continued, were ""the most corrupt, the most designing and the most dangerous of the community."" ""They accused Greeley of all kinds of really whacko things,"" Swint said. ""He was a vegetarian, which was seen as weird. Horace Greeley today would be a New Age guru kind of character. He was also easy to lampoon. He had a large puffy face, and big steel-rimmed glasses."" In a pamphlet titled ""Horace Greeley Unmasked,"" Springfield Republican writer Samuel Bowles is quoted suggesting the candidate's ""perversity of temper and openness to flattery"" made him an easy mark for treacherous operators. Thomas Nast's ""We Are On the Home Stretch"" (1872), published in Harper's Weekly, mocked a politically fallen Greeley (who would die -- literally -- weeks later) Greeley also suffered at the nimble hand of Nast, the Harper's Weekly cartoonist, who skewered the candidate savagely for months. In his now infamous illustration, ""We Are On the Home Stretch,"" a waylaid Greeley is seen, belly up, on a stretcher, defeated and being returned home to his home in Chappaqua, New York. The drawing would prove dramatically prescient. At the end of October, days before the election and a week after the cartoon was published, Greeley's wife died of consumption. Her husband would follow her to the grave a month later, on November 29, before the electoral college could fully register his votes. 1884: 'Ma, Ma, Where's My Pa?' Grover Cleveland's child, born out of wedlock and mostly abandoned, speaks up in ""Another voice for Cleveland,"" a cartoon by Frank Beard (1884) The called him ""Grover the good."" But for all the work Grover Cleveland did in cleaning up corruption during his time as the sheriff of Erie County, mayor of Buffalo and governor of New York, the Democrats' nominee in 1884 led a less tidy personal life. A brief relationship with the widowed Maria Halpin in the early 1870s had yielded a child, but hardly a father. ""It became the story of the day, glorified through the media. There was no smoking gun or direct testimony, all they had were accusations and circumstances. And of course he did know Halpin, and she named her son, his last name, Cleveland,"" Swint said. ""He did admit to having an affair with her"" and paid some child support. The Republicans took aim, calling Cleveland a deadbeat dad while dragging Halpin and the child into the muck. ""There is a famous cartoon (above) of Cleveland walking down the street and a woman carrying a baby saying, 'Ma, Ma, where's my Pa?,'"" Swint said. ""So a lot of was visual. In the days before TV advertising, photos and illustrations in newspapers (carried more weight)."" The rhyme took hold and became a rallying cry for supporters of Cleveland's opponent, James G. Blaine, who sang it in the streets and during campaign events. Unfortunately for Blaine, where Cleveland's issues were mostly the stuff of gossip, the Republican's own misdeeds well-documented -- literally. During his time as speaker of the House from 1869 to 1875, Blaine had in a series of letters articulated the precise details of his self-dealing, which mostly included pushing laws to benefit the railroad companies who, in turn, dished him stock in their growing operations. One particular missive was marked with the now familiar request, ""Burn this letter!"" The recipient failed to meet the request and the nominee was soon being taunted by Cleveland supporters as ""Blaine, Blaine, James G. Blaine, the continental liar from the state of Maine!"" As one Cleveland backer rationalized, the candidates' personal and professional failings, respectively, had made the choice an easy one. ""We are told that Mr. Blaine has been delinquent in office but blameless in public life, while Mr. Cleveland has been a model of official integrity but culpable in personal relations,"" the supporter said. ""We should therefore elect Mr. Cleveland to the public office for which he is so well qualified to fill, and remand Mr. Blaine to the private station which he is admirably fitted to adorn."" It would get worse for Blaine, who ran into more recognizable trouble when one of his allies in New York, the Rev. Samuel Burchard, introduced the candidate with an infamous assault on the Irish community -- effectively calling them drunks and, in what many considered an insult then, Catholics. ""We are Republicans,"" he said, ""and don't propose to leave our party and identify ourselves with the party whose antecedents have been rum, Romanism, and rebellion."" Blaine did not utter a word of protest, his silence helping to solidify political antipathies that endure to the present day. Cleveland would win a narrow popular vote but cruise to victory in the Electoral College. His supporters did not disappoint either, finally returning the ""Ma, Ma, where's my Pa?"" chant with a sharp answer: ""Gone to the White House, ha ha ha!""",0.018373909,0.001837391,0.00413413,0.01607717,0.030776297999999997,0.24988516300000002,0.00597152,2,-1,1
"NC State Troopers Take A Knee Before Protecting Charlotte ? But ItWasn To Protest The National Anthem? As idiots like Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest prejudice against blacks by police officers, cops in Charlotte, NC took a knee to pray before going to confront protesters. That says a lot and shows a huge difference. One is self-centered and obsessed over perceived slights, the other focuses on faith and God. A picture was taken by the North Carolina Troopers Association of these officers praying. It went viral almost immediately and with good reason. This is who we are. Radicals were bused into Charlotte to create havoc and violent chaos. They were also bused into Tulsa yesterday. We were fortunate here in that prayer prevailed and the protests were mostly peaceful. Charlotte was not so fortunate. I saw good people stand between the protesters and police trying to stop the radicals. I saw them kneel in the street praying that it would stop. Faith in God is colorblind? racism and violence are not of God. From the Independent Review Journal: But after an officer-involved shooting in Charlotte left 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scottdead, another photo of people ?taking a knee? began to circulate on social media. These peopleweren on their knees in protest, however. They were on their knees in prayer. The photo, originally posted by the North Carolina Troopers Association, was shared nearly 100,000 times in less than 24 hours and included the following caption: ? 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

There were prayers said across the country and you know what? Racedidn matter. There are a few people making this ugly and rioting in the streets. They are for the most part useful idiots egged on and controlled by Marxists whether they know it or not.

We need to turn away from this hate and division and turn towards God. He is the only one who will lead us out of this.I so very proud of these police officers? they have their priorities straight.

" Massive protests have broken out in Charlotte, North Carolina, after police shot and killed disabled African-American man named Keith Lamont Scott, who was apparently reading a book in his car, waiting for his son to come home from school when officers shot him dead. Details are still sketchy at the moment, but it appears the police were in search of of another armed man in the area. Scott is the sixth civilian shot by Charlotte police this year. Twelve officers have apparently been injured as tear gas canisters were fired into the crowd. Coming so soon after the shooting of Terrence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma, it is clear that all the protests and anger at the disregard for the lives of black Americans shown by our police forces have accomplished nothing. Scott is the 215th black man shot by police this year.

"San Francisco  Hillary Clinton has moved away from the donor circuit after an August of nonstop fundraising, ceding that role to her running mate Tim Kaine, who's getting some celebrity help as well. Since September 1, Kaine has headlined 25 fundraisers in 12 states and Washington, DC, while Clinton has only held eight. Kaine continued his fundraising blitz on Wednesday in California with multiple events in the Bay Area, including a luncheon featuring two long-time Republican donors. Thursday, he's in Houston for an event that features singer Michael Bolton. This is Bolton's second fundraiser for Clinton; he appeared at an event during the Democratic primaries. The Texas Tribune first reported Bolton's appearance. The Houston event is part of Kaine's cash-raising spree. Kaine appeared Wednesday at the Atherton home of Jillian Manus, a Republican donor, philanthropist and businesswoman. The event will be co-hosted by HP CEO Meg Whitman, who ran for California governor as a Republican in 2010. Whitman endorsed Clinton in August, writing in a statement that she would vote for and donate to Clinton. According to average ticket prices and attendance figures provided by the Clinton campaign, Kaine has raised over $16 million in September, as of Wednesday. Clinton has raised around $13 million by the same standard. Clinton also canceled her trip to California earlier this month after she was diagnosed with pneumonia. The change comes after an August where both Clinton and Kaine focused more on fundraising than they did on campaigning. The Democratic duo headlined 70 fundraisers in August (37 for Clinton, 33 for Kaine). The events raised over $80 million, according to CNN's estimate. Clinton aides say that August will be the high-water mark for Clinton personally headlining events. While she will continue to headline events, one aide said more of the load would continue to fall on Kaine. The change is one that donors have long expected and were somewhat surprised it didn't happen in August. Even if Clinton was a more prolific fundraiser in August, Kaine hit the ground running on the fundraising circuit after he was named Clinton's running mate in July. To date, the former Virginia senator has headlined 58 fundraising events and raised closed to $30 million. Clinton still remains a far bigger draw than Kaine, with many of her fundraisers costing tens of thousands of dollars to attend. But Kaine has headlined his share of top dollar fundraisers. An event at the Los Angeles home of Cynthia and Charles Hirschhorn on Tuesday raised $1.4 million. Charles Hirschhorn, a movie producer who worked on ""Bull Durham"" and ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,"" was housemates with Kaine in their student days at Harvard Law School. On Monday, Kaine headlined a ""Latinos for Hillary"" event at the Los Angeles home of actress Eva Longoria. Kaine also headlined an event Tavern on the Green, the historic New York restaurant in Central Park, where five donors paid a whopping $500,000 to dine with the VP candidate. In all, the intimate event raised $2.5 million. Kaine, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, was tapped as Clinton's running mate, in part, because of his ability to raise the money needed to compete in a presidential election. While other factors like his preparedness and ability to win over white working-class voters were key factors in Clinton's decision to pick Kaine, aides said in July that the Virginia senator was the best fundraiser being considered.",0.023696682,0.0,0.004739335999999999,0.016587678,0.016587678,0.187203791,0.0,1,-1,1

" In an interview with Rolling Stone, rock legend and American icon Bruce Springsteen ripped Republican nominee Donald Trump for undermining the integrity of our democracy and for unleashing the undercurrents of white supremacy into mainstream American politics. When asked what his thoughts on the Trump phenomenon were, he gave this nuanced and eloquent response: Well, you know, the republic is under siege by a moron, basically. The whole thing is tragic. Without overstating it,it a tragedy for our democracy. When you start talking about elections being rigged,you pushing people beyond democratic governance. Andit a very, very dangerous thing to do. Once you let those genies out of the bottle, theydon go back in so easy, if they go back in at all. The ideashe moving to the mainstream are all very dangerous ideas ? white nationalism and the alt-right movement. The outrageous things thathe done ? not immediately disavowing David Duke? These are things that are obviously beyond the pale for any previous political candidate. It would sink your candidacy immediately. I believe thatthere a price being paid for not addressing the real cost of the deindustrialization and globalization that has occurred in the United States for the past 35, 40 years and howit deeply affectedpeople lives and deeply hurt people to where they want someone who says they have a solution. AndTrump thing is simple answers to very complex problems. Fallacious answers to very complex problems. And that can be very appealing. It is indeed a tragedy for our democracy. The most important part of democratic governance is ensuring the public believes that our politicians are held in check by the will of the people ? and the behavior of the Republican Party over the past eight years has been to erode that confidence in our electoral system through their efforts gain unfair advantage by repressing the votes of minorities and gerrymandering districts to ensure their political security. At the same time, their single-minded devotion to increasing the political power of the monied elites and funneling the wealth of the American people to the top 1% has greatly exacerbated the costs of deindustrialization/globalization, while studiously denying the existence of those costs in the first place. Donald Trump is the epitome of that excess, the wealthy man who has spent his entire life exploiting and extorting his way to wealth who has now turned to cheap ethnonationalist scapegoating as a way of shifting the blame for the economic frustrations of the working class off of predatory capitalists like himself and onto minority groups. ?The Boss? also gave a resounding endorsement of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, saying that he thinks she would be a ?a very, very good president.?Springsteen words remind us all ofwhat at stake in this election, and whyit so critical that we defeat Donald Trump at the ballot box this November.

" Duringtonight debate, Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he received a ?small loan? from his father to begin his business career. That ?small loan? was for over a million dollars, and his father continued to give him financial backing throughout the early years of his career. His successis proof of the adage that you ?need money to make money,? as he borrowed $14 million from his father and received a blind trust fund which gave him another million. Trump complained to POLITICO that ?It has not been easy for me. It has not been easy for me. I started off in Brooklyn. My father gave me a small loan of a million dollars,? Trump remarked. ?I came into Manhattan, and I had to pay him back, and I had to pay him back with interest. But I came into Manhattan and I started buying properties, and I did great.? Yes, poor Trump spent his early years in expensive boarding schools and was given start-up money for his businesscareer, the success of which has been questionable at best, given his multiple bankruptcies.It hard to imagine anyone more representative of the selfish excesses of wealthy America or be more disconnected from the struggles of everyday Americans.It mind-boggling to understand how anyone can pretend this man cares or even understands the problems facing the American middle class.

" Monday evening during the presidential debates, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump doubled down on his plan to reinstate ?stop-and-frisk,? using New York City as an example of how effective it was in in eradicating crime. Responding to Lester Holt assertion that ?stop and frisk? was ruled unconstitutional, Donald Trump said, ?No,you wrong. It went before a judge who was a very against police judge. It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal.? Fact Check: Stop and Frisk is unconstitutional and was neither lawful nor effective. The program, in which police officers arbitrarily decide when to stop and question a pedestrian, then frisk them for weapons and other contraband, was found to be unlawful after evidence provided proved the NYPD engaged in patterns of unconstitutional stops that were more likely to affect African-American and Latino citizens. Theprogram defenders claimed high crime rates were the reason behind the disproportionate targeting of minorities, but Jeffrey Fagan at Columbia Law School found after an investigation into the program, that ?even if you control for the crime rate, the racial makeup of a precinct is a good predictor of the number of stops? police do in a particular area. ?Anyone who says we know this is bringing the crime rate down is really making it up,? Fagan says. Otherswouldn put it that harshly, but the evidence does seem to suggest that stop and frisk is, at best, ineffective, and, at worst, purposefully targets communities illegally. Examining the number of police stops per seizures of illicit goods mapped out by race, it becomes blatantly obvious that not only are African-Americans stopped over 5x more than whites, the disproportionate targeting is ineffective in reducing crime further because it ignores that the numbers suggest there would be more illicit good seizures if police attention was concentrated more appropriately in groups with a lower stop-per-seizure. Moreover, as foreign correspondent for NBC News Katy Tur live-tweeted during the debate, the murder rate in New York City did not drop until after stop-and-frisk was declared unconstitutional and stopped, it also has not risen beyond a level of concern.

"MIAMI ? DonaldTrump aides are discussing the possibility of asking him to write his biggest check yet to his own campaign to fund an ad blitz, and the billionaire candidate is open to the possibility, according to three people close to the nominee. WhileTrump campaign has experienced a surge in small-dollar fundraising this month that could make an infusion of personal cash unnecessary, major Republican donors are nervous after a rocky first debate against Hillary Clinton and could ramp up pressure on their nominee to invest in the air war. Story Continued BelowTrump campaign last week said that it was planning a $140-million television and digital advertising push between this week and Election Day, in an effort to cut into the massive advertising advantage enjoyed by Clinton. But entering this month, the campaign did not have the money in the bank to pay for the effort, which would represent by far its most ambitious advertising push of the 2016 election.Trump most recent Federal Election Commission filing shows that his campaign had only $50 million in the bank at the end of August. Since then, his small-dollar online fundraising has been especially brisk, raising the prospect that Trump might not need to fund the ad buys from his own pocket ? or might only need to cover part of it, according to the three people close to the candidate. They suggested that Trump is amenable to either possibility ? even if it means writing his biggest check of the campaign to date. Trump relied heavily on his own fortune through the bitter GOP primary, during which he loaned his campaign $43.5 million of his own money. A central tenet of his candidacy was that his ability to self-finance his White House bid made him independent from major donors to whom he suggested his rivals were beholden. Since then, though, Trump has scaled back his self-financing, giving his campaign only about $2 million a month, which he has cast as putting up his own money to match contributions from small donors. Republican insiders in interviews have expressed doubt aboutTrump willingness to inject larger sums of his own cash into the race. His campaign issued another monthly $2-million challenge to small donors on Tuesday, promising in an email that their contributions ?will be instantly matched for double the impact in our race to defeat Hillary Clinton.? Indeed, in combination with the Republican National Committee, the campaign has invested heavily in a small-dollar online fundraising operation, which has produced big numbers, and has helped narrowClinton gaping fundraising lead. The Trump campaign declined to comment on its September fundraising or how much of his own money Trump was prepared to spend. One of the people close to Trump said the real estate developer and reality TV star is ?prepared to do whatever it takes personally to win. But the cash has been pouring in and we have a lot more cash than people think. Now,there actually cash there to pay for the $140 million.? The person rejected a suggestion that the $140-million advertising plan was not realistic, but rather was intended to assuage worried donors and to worryClinton forces. ?That was not a head fake,? said the person. Still,Trump team has only slowly begun investing in some of the trappings of traditional presidential campaigns, and he continues to brag about how littlehe spent relative to Clinton. The Democrat, Trump alleged duringMonday debate has ?spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue.? Yet, he said, ?the only gratifying thing is I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money ? I'm either winning or tied. AndI spent practically nothing.? In fact,Trump campaign had spent $119 million overall through the end of August, but its advertising budget has been a fraction of that ofClinton campaign. Through the end of last week,Clinton campaign had spent more than five times the $22 million that Trump has spent on TV and radio ads for the general election, according to Kantar Media. And the gap appears to be widening, even asTrump fundraising has taken off. In the 10 days leading up to the debate,Clinton campaign aired 12,812 ads on local television in the 61 top markets, compared to 1,378 for Trump, according to the tracking company Media Monitors. Trump's planned $140-million ad buy will focus on 13 states, including battlegrounds like Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania, but also Maine, New Mexico and Wisconsin, according to an Associated Press report. Jessica Ditto, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, told POLITICO that last week it began reserving $100 million in television advertising and $40 million in digital ads, with the first $15-million-worth placed Friday. ?The broadcast/cable ratio will continue to fluctuate in line with targeting needs,? Ditto said. Ad buying data provided to POLITICO does not reflect the full weight of the buy yet. It indicates thatTrump campaign has purchased roughly $9.8 million in advertising between Tuesday and Election Day, compared to $41 million over that same period forClinton campaign.",0.023890785,0.0,0.0,0.018771331000000002,0.039249147000000005,0.252559727,0.003412969,2,-1,1

"Trump again slams former Miss Universe over weight Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe winner who Donald Trump once called ?Miss Piggy,? was ?the worst we ever had,? the Manhattan billionaire said Tuesday morning, because ?she gained a massive amount of weight.? Hillary Clinton called attention toMachado case towards the end of Mondaynight presidential debate, recalling that Trump had not only called her ?Miss Piggy? but also ?Miss Housekeeping,? a reference to her Hispanic heritage. AddressingTrump name-calling directly, Clinton said ?Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a U.S. citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November."" Story Continued Below Trump said that while nothing Clinton did throughout the debate to that point had managed to get under his skin, the former secretary ofstate decision to bring up Machado did frustrate him. ?That person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible, and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe,? Trump explained during a Tuesday morning appearance on FoxNews ?Fox and Friends.? ?She was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. This was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was Mother Teresa and it wasn't quite that way, but that's okay. Hillary has to do what she has to do.?Clinton discussion of the former Miss Universe winner came amid a larger attack againstTrump history of disrespectful and derogatory remarks about women. Of her GOP opponent, Clinton said ?This is a man who has calling women pigs, slobs and dogs and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said that women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.? Trump said he had considered replying by raising former President BillClinton history of infidelity as a response but opted against it because thecouple daughter, Chelsea Clinton, was in the room. The Manhattan billionaire said he might opt not to hold back such an attack at the next debate. ?Well, I may hit her harder certain ways,? he said. ?I really eased up because I didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings.

"BREAKING: Judge DEMANDS Release OfClinton Security Training Files ? She Has 5 Days? Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people andthat no joke. Theyshouldn be cleared to clean a toilet there. The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should andshouldn do.It called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it? Iwouldn hold my breath. From The Daily Caller: A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the StateDepartment motion to dismissTheDCNF Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also deniedTheDCNF request to depose State Department officials. ? 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan. Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, Idon look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail? guess we justaren the ?right people?. Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th.

He need not wing it,?Trump campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told Fox Business. ?There?s a difference between being spontaneous and just, you know, being yourself at the debate stage.? Story Continued Below Trump and Clinton will square off Monday in New York at Hofstra University for the first presidential debate. While Clinton has taken time off the trail for debate prep, Trump has largely eschewed the traditional debate prep process. His campaign, however, maintains that the real estate mogul will be prepared for Monday's bout. ?Idon thinkhe locked up in a cabin for two weeks like other people have been ? or currently are ? cramming their heads with microchips and binders, buthe a brilliant man,?

The organization, which launched in 2006 with the express purpose of tracking money in politics, said that it would end its tool building and database maintenance, which are often used by reporters writing about campaign finance and politics. Michael Klein, the SunlightFoundation board chairman, wrote in a post Tuesday explaining the decision to scale back dramatically. ?While we are enormously proud of what Sunlight has accomplished over the past decade, and has come to stand for, we are also aware of the changes time has wrought,? Klein wrote in the post. ?We are aware that the robust maturation of technology over the past decade has ? happily but substantially ? reduced the urgency ofSunlight early role as a leading transparency innovator. In addition, the board had to recognize thatSunlight initiating objective? to build support for better legislation against and regulation of the power of money in politics? has been significantly limited by the US SupremeCourt 5-4 Citizens United decision.?It unclear the number of people who were laid off from Sunlight Foundation Tuesday, or who could be laid off in the future. The organization as of Tuesday morning employed around 25 people. Several staffers were informed today that their positions had been eliminated, but management is still in the process of informing others. At least one staff writer, Libby Watson, announced on Twitter that she had been laid off. A spokesperson for Sunlight Foundation said that financial challenges played a role in the cuts and suspension of its tools. Sunlight Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, is funded through donations. ?It became increasingly harder to fund and maintain all of these different things,? the spokesperson said, referring to the various tools Sunlight Foundation has built over the years, tracking everything from deleted tweets of politicians to political fundraising. Another factor was theorganization inability to find a permanent executive director with a vision for theorganization future, Klein wrote. Sunlight Foundation co-founder, Ellen Miller, stepped down from her role as executive director in 2014, and the organization struggled to retain upper management since then. ?The board has not found a candidate for executive director who persuaded us of both a compelling new strategic vision and of their capacity to lead Sunlight to its achievement,? Klein wrote. ?Accordingly, we have determined to explore alliances with other organizations similarly motivated, perhaps merging with one of them, in an arrangement that advances and preservesSunlight mission and identity with increased efficiency and effectiveness.? The hope is that SunlightFoundation work can live on and be built upon at likeminded organizations devoted to government transparency and campaign finance. Those possible partnerships ? or a potential merger with another organization, which Klein said the organization was exploring ? will play a role in the fate of the employees at the nonprofit. Those potential partnerships are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.

"The White House published a toolkitof economic evidence and policy fixes to help local political leaders fight back against the NIMBYs that tend to hold sway over municipal zoning meetings. | AP Photo Obama takes on zoning laws in bid to build more housing, spur growth The Obama administration Monday is calling on cities and counties to rethink their zoning laws, saying that antiquated rules on construction, housing and land use are contributing to high rents and income inequality, and dragging down the U.S. economy as a whole. City zoning battles usually are fought block by block, and the president's involvement will create friction, particularly among environmental groups and the not-in-my-backyard crowd. But the White House jawboning is welcome news to many others, including mayors and builders increasingly foiled by community opposition to development. Story Continued Below The White House published a toolkitof economic evidence and policy fixes to help local political leaders fight back against the NIMBYs that tend to hold sway over municipal zoning meetings. ?In more and more regions across the country, local and neighborhood leaders have said yes in our backyard,? the paper states. ?We need to break down the rules that stand in the way of building new housing.? The prescriptions call for more density, speedier permitting and fewer restrictions on accessory dwelling units such as basement and garage apartments. The plan rejects some of the arguments made by environmentalists, labor unions and other liberal constituencies that have stood in the way of development and endorses changes long sought by builders and the business community. ?When unnecessary barriers restrict the supply of housing and costs increase, then workers, particularly lower-income workers who would benefit the most, are less able to move to high-productivity cities,? said Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. ?All told, this means slower economic growth.? Zoning policy might seem picayune for a president, but eight years after the foreclosure crisis left the country littered with empty homes, the country is facing a critical housing shortage in its most vibrant job centers. The result is soaring rents, growing income inequality and sputtering economic growth nationwide. By one estimate , barriers to development in major cities have shaved as much as $1.95 trillion a year off U.S. economic growth. ?It?s important that the president is talking about it,? said Mark Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute. ?Local restrictions on housing supply are a crucial economic issue. I would sayit one of the top 10.?There not much the White House can do beyond talk. Theadministration 2017 budget request includes $300 million in grants to help mayors update zoning rules, and the Department of Transportation has begun weighing plans for housing growth and affordability before approving funding for certain transit projects. Despite a growing consensus among economists that slow-growth policies of the 1970s are hurting job and income growth, many elected officials continue to face local opposition to liberalized development. Earlier this year, environmentalists and labor unions quickly shut down a plan by California Gov. Jerry Brown that would have made it easier for developers to build apartments and condominiums. The proposal got nowhere, despite the support of mayors, businesses and the White House. The case illustrates the steep road to change and the need for high-profile jawboning, Calabria said. ?Normally governorsdon like to get involved in local land-use decisions,? Calabria said. ?And if you have a president talking about it,that unusual.?",0.022675737,0.0,0.004535147,0.009070295,0.034013605,0.24716553300000002,0.0,2,-1,1
"Story highlights ""This, though, is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have,"" Clinton said The deaths of black civilians in confrontations with the police has taken center stage in the election Orlando (CNN) Hillary Clinton kicked off a campaign event Wednesday by saying that the recent police killings of two African-American men that unleashed a national uproar this week are ""unbearable"" and ""intolerable."" Clinton used those words the day before to describe last week's shooting death of Terence Crutcher in Oklahoma, but revisited the issue Wednesday in light of the death of Keith Lamont Scott in North Carolina. Her comments -- which came at the beginning of a lengthy speech about improving economic opportunities for disabled Americans -- marked her first on-camera remarks on the shootings, which have again sparked a debate about lethal police force. ""There is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,"" Clinton said. ""It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable."" The Democratic nominee added: ""I know I don't have all the answers. I don't know anyone who does. This, though, is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have.""

"Should he orshouldn he? Should debate moderator Lester Holt ?fact-check? the candidates? That is one of the big questions abouttonight debate at Hofstra, University. IMHO Being a moderator at a debate is a lot like being an umpire at a baseball game. If you leave the game talking about the umpire it means the umpire screwed up. But just like major decisions in my household, the question of fact-checking is not my decision;it themoderator and there is pressure on him from team Clinton and the liberal media to play truth police as well as moderate the debate.

"The 10 most memorable moments of the presidential debate Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump wasted little time going for each other's jugulars Monday, each stampeding over the other's talking points as their intensely anticipated first debate began. Each candidate knows that the perception of their performance ? from their command of policy issues and ability to articulate a vision for the country to their ability to parry barbs and attacks from their rival ? could set the trajectory for the rest of the campaign. Here are the most memorable and important moments of the night: Story Continued Below 1) Trump: Clintondoesn look presidential Trump reiterated that Clinton ?doesn?t have the look? of a president and said ?shedoesn have the stamina.? Clinton had a quick rebuke. ?Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.? Clinton attempted to turn the topic back toTrump derogatory comments toward women, invoking a beauty pageant contestant she claimed Trump had called ?Ms. Piggy? and ?Ms. Housekeeping.? ?Donald, she has a name,? Clinton said, as Trump interjected, saying, ?Where did you find this?? Trump argued that his comments were largely aimed at RosieO (who he had a long running feud with) and then he offered a subtle suggestion he had considered invoking of the Clintons? marital strife ? including herhusband infidelity. ?I said to myself, I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice,? he said. ?But she's (spent) hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads even me, many of which are untrue, and they're misrepresentations, and I will tell you this, Lester, it's not nice, and I don't deserve that, but it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.? 2) Trump to Americans on racial healing: 'I say nothing' As Holt pressed Trump on his role in perpetuating the birther controversy against President Barack Obama, he asked Trump whathe say to Americans about the need for racial healing. ?I say nothing,? Trump replied, ?because I was able to get him to produce [his birth certificate]. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing.? Trump struggled to respond to charges that he fomented the debunked claim that Obama was born outside the United States for years after Obama produced his long-form birth certificate. Instead, he reiterated his claim thatClinton own advisers pushed the controversy during their divisive primary in 2008. ?I'll tell you just simple to say, Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton. And her campaign manager, Patty Doyle went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against president Obama fought very hard, and you can go look it up and you can check it out,? he said. ?If you look at CNN this past week, Patty Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened, Blumenthal sent McClatchy to Kenya to find out about it, they were pressing very hard. They failed to get the birth certificate.? ?I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job,? he continued, adding of Clinton, ?just like she can't bring back jobs she can't produce.? 3) The fact check fight As Donald Trump excoriated Hillary Clinton for once describing the Trans-Pacific Partnership as the ""gold standard"" of trade deals, Clinton shot back that he was mischaracterizing her position against the deal. ""I know you live in your own reality, but those are not the facts,"" she said. Soon after, she plugged her home page and urged viewers to visit her campaign's live Trump fact check. Trump cut in to plug his own website next. View The 10 most memorable moments of the presidential debate Here are the most memorable and important moments of the night from the first presidential debate at Hofstra University on Monday. After a tussle over taxes, Trump fired back. ""Look at her website. It's no different than this,"" he said. ""She's telling us how to fight ISIS. She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don't think general MacArthur would like that too much."" Trump repeatedly slammed Clinton for the Obama administration's fiscal policies. She again retorted. ""I have a feeling by the end of this evening I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened,"" she said. ""Why not?"" he mused. ""Yeah. Why not? Just join the debate by saying more crazy things,"" she said. 4) Paying no income tax 'makes me smart' Trump parried a question about his still-hidden tax returns by vowing emphatically to release them as soon as Clinton produces 33,000 deleted emails from her private server. ""I will release my tax returns, against my lawyer's wishes, when she releases her 33,000 emails that have been deleted,"" he said. ""As soon as she releases them, I will release my tax returns and that's against my lawyers say don't do it."" The audience broke into cheers, violating the rules of decorum set out by moderator Lester Holt. Clinton replied that Trump's comment was ""another example of bait and switch here."" ""You've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be. Third, we don't know all of his business dealings,"" she said, adding that he may not have paid any income tax. ""That makes me smart,"" he interjected. 5) Trump defends business practices After Clinton slammed Trump for ""stiffing"" his workers and bringing companies into bankruptcy, Trump defended his dealings. ""Look, it's all words. It's all sound bites,"" he said. ""I built an unbelievable company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets in the world beyond the United States and it's an unbelievable company. But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there."" As for Clinton's contention about his workers, Trump said: ""First of all, they did get paid a lot but taking advantage of the laws of the nation. ... Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company."" Trump also seemed to contemplate losing the presidential race, noting the hotel he just opened on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C. ""If I don't get there in one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Ave. another,"" he said. 6) Trump hints atClinton stamina Trump attempted to stoke hiscampaign insinuation that Clinton lacks the stamina to be president. In a discussion of his travels to urban areas to speak to African American voters, Trump notedhe been to Detroit and Philadelphia. ?You've seen me, I've been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that's okay,? he said. Clinton counterpunched. ?I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,? she said. ?And yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing."" 7) Trump to Clinton: 'We agree.' The first interaction of the night wasn't the haymaker many people expected. Trump's first comment directed at Clinton was about an area of agreement: Child care.

That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her,? Trump said of Clinton. ?The record shows otherwise,? Holt said.

"Following the presidential debate, Donald Trump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson opened her mouth on CBS and stupidity just flowed out of it. Pierson was on the show to discuss DonaldTrump debate performance on Monday. When Trumpwasn sniffling, he was interrupting Hillary Clinton. Naturally, Pierson blamed Hillary Clinton for Donald Trump touting the stop-and-frisk policy, which by the way, was ruled unconstitutional in 2013. During the post-debate panel, Pierson was asked to comment on DonaldTrump recent proposal to get more cities to adopt the kind of stop-and-frisk policy in New York that was found unconstitutional back in 2013. As a shock to no one ever, Rudy Giuliani, a huge Trump supporter, is and was a proponent of the racist policy. Pierson took another route and blamed Clinton, because of course: ?In responding, Pierson said that stop-and-frisk was effective at stopping crime and was not really racist ? but then she blamed Hillary Clinton for stop-and-frisk being necessary because of her own racism.? ?It actually did work in New York,? Pierson said of the stop-and-frisk policy. ?But we have to get down to why, becausethat whywe here today. We have two candidates who have very different views. The reason why we have this problem, the reason why stop-and-frisk was implemented, was there were disparities with regard to who people were pulling over,? she continued. She went on to say: ?Andit profiling, criminal profiling, not necessarily racial profiling, even though it comes across that way. But the reason why we had it was that we had the First Lady of the United States who went out on the national stage and dehumanized young black children? this has been the conditioning of the American public where black children have been demonized, Hillary Clinton owns that.? Watch: In late August, Trump tweeted, ?How quickly people forget that Crooked Hillary called African-American youth ?SUPER PREDATORS? ? Has she apologized?? Yes, Hillary Clinton made the ?super predators? remark more than 20 years ago, but it was not directed toward African-American children. This is nothing new for Pierson.

"Early on Thursday, the DC Leaks Twitter account posted the purported image of Michelle Obama's passport. | Getty Powell leakers strike again with alleged White House staffer emails, Michelle Obama passport The hacker website that leaked Colin Powell's politically embarrassing emails struck again Thursday, this time releasing what appears to be the personal emails of a White House staffer working with HillaryClinton campaign ? and what purports to be an image of MichelleObama passport. An initial scan of the messages appear to show chatter mostly regarding event planning details, such as requesting an invoice for a stage used at a Clinton campaign event. In one exchange, the advanced planning team expresses concern that the media might notice a group of protesters at one event. Story Continued Below The emails appear to be taken from the staffer's personal Gmail account, and span from February 2015 to July of this year. A Secret Service spokeswoman said the agency was ?aware of the alleged email hacking of a White House employee.? ?The Secret Service is concerned any time unauthorized information that might pertain to one of the individuals we protect, or our operations, is allegedly disclosed,? spokeswoman Nicole Mainor told POLITICO. ?As a matter of policy, we do not provide information regarding investigations.? White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to discuss the leak at his daily briefing. ?Administration officials are taking a look at the informationthat been disclosed,? Earnest told reporters. ?Obviously we take any reports about a cyber breach seriously, particularly if it may include some sensitive information.? Attorney General Loretta Lynch told reporters that the Justice Department is ""aware of those media reports."" ""It is something that we're looking into,"" she said. According to a LinkedIn page, the staffer has worked as an advance associate for the White House since April 2015. The staffer also appears to work with the Clinton campaign as an event organizer. The email dump was posted late Wednesday on the purported anti-secrecy site DC Leaks, which security experts have connected to the suspected Russian cyberattack campaign targeting U.S. political institutions and state election offices. Most notably, the site has also posted the pilfered private emails of Powell, as well as the alleged communications of other Clinton campaign workers and a few Republican lawmakers who have been critical of the Russian regime, including Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham. Early on Thursday, the DC Leaks Twitter account posted the purported image of Michelle Obama's passport. The emails may have been stolen during a previously reported cyberattack campaign that targeted at the personal email accounts of at least 26 Clinton campaign staffers and volunteers. Digital forensic experts have tied that digital assault to the same Russian hacking group that is believed to have also infiltrated other top Democratic institutions, including the Democratic National Committee.

"DISGRACEFUL: Obama Jokes About ISIS On The Day America Is Bombed Twice [VIDEO] Last Saturday, thousands of people were about to participate in a charity 5K race to benefit Marines and sailors in New Jersey when they discovered a bomb had been planted in an area where the crowd would be standing. Later that evening, nine people were stabbed at a shopping mall in Minnesota in a horrific act of violence by a man making references to ?Allah?. Obama, the President of the United States, MUST have heard about the New Jersey and New York bombings earlier Saturday before giving his speech at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Dinner.

"Obama weighs in on the debate President Barack Obama hasn't changed his assessment of Donald Trump after Monday night's debate: The GOP nominee, he said on Tuesday, lacks the preparation and temperament for the presidency and can't be trusted to address serious threats like nuclear weapons and climate change. The president unloaded on Trump during an interview with Ryan Seacrest in the wake of Trump's showdown with Hillary Clinton, which he watched from the Treaty Room of the White House. Story Continued Below Obama toutedClinton performance and her qualifications for the presidency, saying ?she?s serious and does her homework.? And he blasted Trump for not having the ?preparations and the temperament or the core values of inclusion and making everybody, you know, have opportunities that would take our country forward.? The president said his two biggest concerns for his daughters? generation are the spread of nuclear weapons and the onset of climate change ? adding that Trump falls short on both. ""I get worried when I hear somebody like Donald Trump start saying, 'Well, I don't necessarily know whether Japan or Korea should be protected by us. Maybe they should get their own nuclear weapons.' That shows somebody who doesn't pay attention to these issues, and you don't necessarily want close to the nuclear button,? Obama said. (Trump objected to a similar characterization of his views on East Asia during Monday's debate, saying it was ""wrong."")

"Their distaste for Donald Trump was no secret. But they saw no point in publicizing it. From Miami to Houston, Crawford to Kennebunkport, members of the RepublicanParty first family remained quiet for months, avoiding cameras and questions about presidential politics and focusing their few fundraiser appearances on assisting the GOP candidates who would be forced to share the November ballot with a nominee they detest. Story Continued Below But given the Bushclan proximity to public life, and theirprogeny desire to one day return the family to power, it was only a matter of time before they could hold their tongues no longer. Over a 24-hour span that began with Jeb Bush's surprising and sardonic cameo in Sunday's Emmy Awards broadcast and Mondaynight reports that his father, former President George H.W. Bush, had told a family friend privately that he intended to support Hillary Clinton, the Bushes returned to the headlines, and are giving Trump just the establishment foil he so capably exploits. ""He probably loves that former President Bush isn't backing him because it underlines his whole case against the establishment,"" one former Jeb Bush campaign staffer said. ""I bet he's highlighting it in his stump speech before long."" George W. Bush, who is headed to Washington this weekend to headline a fundraiser for Senate Republicans and attend the opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, has shared in private settings for months his fear that he will be ?the last Republican president.? And while Bush family loyalists say they do not know whether he is joking, they are certain he cannot support Trump. ?When you have a Republican nominee who supported John Kerry in 2004 and implied that President Bush was responsible for 9/11 and has repeated the worst lies of the Michael Moore liberal Democrats, how in the world would the Bushes support that?? said one longtime GOP operative close to the Bush family. George H.W. Bush, at 92 years of age, is the freest to disavow allegiance to theparty nominee. Although sources close to the former president indicate he would have preferred his vote remain confidential, he harbors a deep disgust for Trump, who mocked and insulted his son throughout the primary and whose life of shameless self-promotion and a coarse approach to politics are an affront to the cultivated gentility and pragmatic, big-tent conservatism he and his sons personify. ?Forty-one instilled a duty and service mentality in the DNA of his boys,? said Slater Bayliss, an alumnus of JebBush administration in Tallahassee and a supporter of his 2016 campaign. ?Idon think Jeb ran for president because it was best for him, but thought he could make a difference with a positive, policy-focused agenda. The fact that we would expect a guy who was a Republican president to support every future Republican presidential candidate is silly, especially when you have one like Donald Trump.? For George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, who has demurred on questions about howhe vote in the presidential race and focused on assisting down-ballot Republicans, there is also the consideration of the bond they share with the Clintons as members of an exclusive presidential fraternity and the disaster relief work they have collaborated on as ex-presidents. ?There is a mutual regard that exists, despite their obvious political differences, between the families,? one source close to the Bush family said. ?And also a mutual disregard, a shared disgust for Trump as someone so far outside of that club.? Those close to the family also doubt that any of the Bush women will privately cast a vote for Trump. Barbara Bush campaigned for Jeb in New Hampshire and lamentedTrump foul language and desecration of the political norms her family always abided by. Laura Bush and her daughter Jenna Bush Hager have similarly expressed worries aboutTrump effect on the political discourse and pleaded the Fifth when asked whetherthey be voting for Trump. Jeb Bush, who prosecuted the case against Trump to little avail throughout the primary, has said publicly that hedoesn plan to cast a ballot for Trump or Clinton ? a reasonable position for someone who may hold out hopes of another presidential run or a position in a GOP administration down the road, should Trump lose in November and allow the party to reset itself for 2020. ?Idon know ifit part of his thinking or not, but it would be a tough sell to the party to accept him ifhe on the record as having cast a vote for a Democratic nominee.? Interestingly enough, JebBush son George P. Bush is the only family member publicly backing Trump. After watching the GOP nominee disparage, dismiss and eventually defeat his father, the Texas land commissioner, a telegenic Latino who has made no secret of his own ambitions for higher office, fell in line behind theparty nominee, even though he acknowledged it being a ?bitter pill to swallow.? ?DonaldTrump candidacy has divided Republican families around the country, and it sounds like thisone no different,? said one Republican bundler who is close to the Bush family. The elderBush admission that he plans to vote for Clinton occurred during a board meeting for the formerpresident Thousand Points of Light Foundation. Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, the former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy, asked Bush about his choice during a receiving line and got a frank answer ? which she then posted to her Facebook page, prompting news reports Monday and Tuesday, confirming that Bush indeed plans to vote for Clinton. Several sources close to the former president expressed frustration Tuesday with the notion that Townsend would publicize what she heard while visiting a 92-year-oldman living room, calling it a breach of privacy. But the former president himself issued no statement denying the reports of what he said. Even before news ofBush backing,Clinton campaign was running a television ad highlighting a number of Republicans criticizing Trump. And she has already won endorsements from many Republicans who worked in one or both Bush administrations. But just as early forecasts of a possible Bush-Clinton matchup were met with frustration and fatigue in the run-up to thisyear campaign cycle, confirmation this week of some sort of alliance between the families may only serve to harden theelectorate obvious antipathy to dynastic, establishment politics. ?The reality is, if all of this meant something, Donald Trump would not be the nominee,? said Bruce Haynes, a GOP consultant in Washington. ?In Raleigh and Des Moines, peopledon give a damn about what the Bushes say or do. If anything, they see the establishment politicians closing ranks around Clinton and are more emboldened to do the opposite.?",0.029177718999999998,0.00397878,0.00397878,0.019893899,0.058355437999999996,0.279840849,0.00132626,2,-1,1
"Story highlights The State Department is expected to release fewer than 1,000 pages of Hillary Clinton's emails recovered from her private server before Election Day, per a federal judge's order Friday Washington (CNN) A federal judge on Friday ordered the State Department to release some, but not all, of the emails recovered from Hillary Clinton's private server by the FBI ahead of the presidential election in November. DC District Court Judge James Boasberg said the department must process 1,050 pages of emails between now and November 4, releasing any non-exempt documents aside from those that are determined to be duplicates of those already released. It is unclear exactly how many pages the State Department will have to release as part of that order, but it is expected to be significantly fewer than 1,000 pages. That's because a ""substantial number"" of the recovered documents are duplicates or near-duplicates, a Justice Department attorney representing the State Department said in court. The State Department has appraised approximately 15,000 documents recovered by the FBI, believed to have been sent by or to former Secretary Clinton while she was in office. Of those, over 9,400 have been deemed personal and therefore not subject to release, the attorney said, while approximately 5,600 are believed to be work-related. Production will begin October 7, with subsequent releases October 21 and November 4 -- four days before the election. Read More",0.0625,0.0,0.0,0.00625,0.0875,0.18125,0.0,2,-1,1

" The circus of politics can often be a distraction from actual policy -- and last night's debate proved no exception when it came to the subject of foreign affairs. The back and forth between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was perhaps more instructive in terms of what was not mentioned -- Syria's civil war, for instance -- than what was discussed. To be fair, the debate was not intended to focus on international issues, which were basically a footnote in the ""securing America"" segment. But amid the exchanges about ISIS, Iran, NATO and nuclear proliferation, there were some brief glimpses of what the world might look like under a President Trump or a President Clinton. Fighting ISIS Trump to Clinton: You're going to stop ISIS? ""I don't think so."" https://t.co/iXIwDaIPem #DebateNight https://t.co/a0RbNrI174 For the most part, Trump focused on attacking Clinton's record -- ""she's got experience, but it's bad experience"" -- rather than on articulating his own foreign policy proposals. That was certainly true of the discussion on ISIS, which was mentioned 24 times during the foreign policy part of the debate. Clinton spoke of the need to ""intensify our air strikes against ISIS,"" ""support our Arab and Kurdish partners,"" and ""take out their leadership"" -- positions that don't differ much from President Barack Obama's current policies.

Already under Obama, there is a perception that the US has retreated from taking an international leadership role, particularly in the Middle East. Clinton sought to provide some reassurance that she would be different, saying: ""we've got to work more closely with our allies"". But it remains to be seen how she would take on some of the toughest foreign policy questions -- namely, the civil war in Syria -- in a way that would be meaningfully different or more impactful than her predecessor.

"AP Photo Cable news? election-year haul could reach $2.5 billion All-time ratings records for CNN and Fox drive growth ? but this won't last The preliminary numbers are in, and they suggest that the first presidential debate of 2016 between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will be the most watched debate going back decades. With the first presidential debate of 2012 averaging 70 million viewers, last night is looking like a massive night for TV news. The numbers from all the channels will be made available by Nielsen over the course of the day. All told, the early numbers continue to show that 2016 just seems to keep getting better for TV news channels. And with the presidential campaign nearing its final stretch, the first forecasts are coming in for just how good the Trumped-up 2016 presidential campaign has been to them. With the 2016election pivotal events delivering record ratings moments every few months (highest rated primary debate, highest rated primary election night coverage, etc), CNN and Fox News are poised to have the most-watched years in their respective histories, stretching back to 1980 for CNN and 1996 for Fox News. MSNBC has a chance to do so as well. Many networks reported thatthey ?sold out? their first debate night early, and are expecting the same for the next three. Story Continued Below And that means money. According to data from media and communications data firm SNL Kagan, a division of SMP Global Market Intelligence, the three major cable news networks are set to make nearly $2 billion in ad revenues, and the three main business networks are set to add another $458 million in ad revenue from just the 2016 calendar year. ?We?ve been outselling our election packages for a year now,? said Katrina Cukaj, EVP of Portfolio Sales & Client Partnerships for Turner Ad Sales, which includes CNN. ?We are close to selling out for the rest of the [election related] days; there is very high demand. Very high.? Fox News is expecting a ?multimillion dollar revenue night? when all the money is counted. According to the Wall Street Journal, CNN is selling debate and election night ad packages with minimums of $800,000 to $1 million, with 30 second ads for the presidential debates going for more than $55,000. Other cable news channels are selling similar bundled ad packages. And those kinds of numbers take into account that there are no ad interruptions during the debate ? all those ads are sold against pre- and post-game analysis and panels. ?There is considerably higher demand in this election cycle with higher price points compared to the other election cycles,? an NBC source said. According to SNL Kagan, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC will combine for approximately $1.96 billion in gross ad sales in 2016. Compare that to $1.72 million in calendar year 2015 (which saw a number of high-profile primary debates), and $1.56 million in calendar year 2012, the last presidential election year. The ad revenue makes sense when you look at the numbers. The first Republican debate in August of 2015 brought in a record-breaking 24 million viewers for Fox News. Fox News? March debate in Detroit, Michigan averaged just under 17 million viewers. Through March and April, big primary nights would draw an average of 10-12 million viewers across cable news and on 10 p.m. broadcast specials. Those sorts of ratings are typically reserved for major sporting events like NFL games, or huge hit shows like NCIS. This election cycle has been delivering them with regularity, even if they are spread out across a number of channels. The election is also broadening the types of advertisers who are hoping to catch the eyeballs of the big election audiences. Cukaj saidshe seen an uptick in entertainment and movie advertisements. ?Movie studios and entertainment has been very, very active in these big election events, they enjoy the nice big ratings these live events do,? Cukaj said. Fox News EVP of advertising sales Paul Rittenberg told AdWeek ?there's substantially more demand from [advertisers] who didn't used to buy a lot of news; we even have a beer [company].? That company is Tecate, which was running a debate-specific ad about a wallon Fox News, Univision and Telemundo during the pre and post-debate shows. (In fact, the wall never came up in the debate.) Among the entertainment advertisers is Epix, which aired a faux-cable news segment before lastnight debate, featuring cable news regulars Michael Steele, Amy Holmes and Barney Frank. CNN had to run a gold banner over the segmentto ensure viewers knew it was not CNN content. For the broadcast networks, the 2016 campaign has largely been a boon, even if election-related programming has occasionally competed with or preempted more lucrative entertainment and sports programming (at $200,000 per 30 second spot, the debate programming would be very similar to what standard entertainment fare would bring in). Still, this broadcast season, news programming has been one of the few bright spots, with most entertainment and sports programming seeing ratings declines compared to last year. The broadcast networks CBS and NBC are selling 30 second ads for more than $200,000 each, according to the Journal. Advertising rates for the presidential debates may not be as high as some primary debates were, as they do not have commercial breaks, so all ads run before and after the debate when the channels are doing pre- and post-debate analysis (in case you were wondering why there is so much of it, the answer is: inventory!) For the networks, that eats into valuable prime-time real estate, where entertainment programming can command higher premiums.There another reason debates like the one last nightaren quite as valuable as they could be: Scarcity, or lack thereof. With the debate airing on more than 10 TV channels, and streaming on hundreds of websites, the audience will be massive, but highly fragmented. In fact, despite the massive 2016 haul, the picture for television news continues to be bleak. For one thing, news networks these days are making less than half their money from advertising, so ""big years"" don't have nearly the lasting effect they might otherwise. Where does the rest of their revenue come from? For big networks like CNN, a lot of it comes from ?carriage fees? ? the lucrative contracts the big news networks sign with cable providers like Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications in return for allowing their channel to appear on the carriers? channel line-ups. These deals ? which can be contentious and result in channel blackouts with individual providers but usually, ultimately go the TV networks' way ? are often negotiated in multi-year terms. Time Warner CFO Howard Averill said that next year, 2017, will deliver record profits for CNN, beating 2016 despite thisyear election boost. Previously negotiated carriage fee increases guarantee that result, even if the channel sees a steep ratings decline. Andthat just one place where the connection between audience size and revenue is deteriorating. In fact, while 2016 may top the revenue charts, the three big cable news networks have actually been on the rebound since 2013, with all three increasing ad revenue every year since then. These good signs are generally taken with a grain of salt behind the closed doors of the TV businesses? executive suites. The chief worries: Television audiences are aging out of the TV news ecosystem, and not being replaced by younger viewers coveted by advertisers. Over time, this will also depress audience numbers, as those aging viewers are replaced by fewer young viewers growing into engagement with TV news. And indeed, not everyone has shared in the big bounty of 2016. Local ad revenue, which relies heavily on political spending, has not been as strong as anticipated. SNL Kagan downgraded their projected income of $3.3 billion for local television down to $3.1 billion partly as a result of Trump not spending as much on advertising. Sinclair Broadcasting, thecountry largest owner of TV stations, warned investors last week that 2016 political ad spending was falling short of expectations. Ironically, the presence of Donald Trump in the 2016 campaign, often discussed as if it were the reason this election is such a television draw, is a factor in that slump. ?While we previously anticipated a decline in presidential ad spending in the third quarter based on the late fund-raising by the Trump campaign, we have yet to see significant spending, even at the levels we initially anticipated,? Sinclair CFO Chris Ripley said at a conference hosted by Goldman Sachs. CBS CEO Les Moonves told attendees at the same conference that his local station revenue was on track, but much of that was coming in from local and statewide races and issue campaigns. As far as the presidential campaign, there was one big reason Moonves pointed to to describe the unexpected slump: ?To generalize, [there is not as much spending from] the top of the tickets, because Mr. Trump does not appear to be spending as much as people thought.? ?

"Story highlights Warren has been an attack dog of sorts for Clinton ever since she clinched the Democratic nomination She also called Trump ""a twisted bully who can't fight his own fights"" Washington (CNN) Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren tore into Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on the campaign trail Saturday for lying about President Barack Obama's citizenship and hinting at violence against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Speaking to Clinton supporters at Ohio State University, Warren continued her ongoing feud with Trump by criticizing his admission Friday -- after five years of falsehoods -- that Obama was born in the US. ""Only when his handlers tied him down and forced him did he grudgingly admit that the man was born in the United States,"" Warren said. ""What kind of a man does that? A man with a dark and ugly soul."" Later Friday, Trump, at a campaign event in Miami, cited Clinton's push for greater gun control to suggest the Democrat's Secret Service detail should disarm. ""Let's see what happens to her,"" Trump said. ""Take their guns away, OK? It'll be very dangerous.""

"What REALLY had me scratching my head yesterday is one of the reasons why the FY17 NDAA is being held up. It was something I heard from several Congressional offices. And folks, you just cannot make this up. As Written By Allen B. West:I been here in Washington, DC since Sunday evening. One thing you immediately notice in DC these days is the number of construction cranes up and operating. I mean, the SW Waterfront and the area around Nationals Park is exploding. Even over near my bat cave there are new condominiums and structures going up. My concern is that if there are more folks moving into Washington, DC, government is expanding. And if government is expanding, then fewer construction cranes are on Main Street, and the resources for the American citizen to build their own new home is being usurped by this behemoth.I here this week primarily to discuss certain policy proposals that we at the National Center for Policy Analysis (NCPA) have offered for the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Even with the expansive growth of the federal government, one would presume that in this era of massive proliferation of Islamic jihadism, our national security and defense would be a priority. The purpose of the NDAA is to set the missions and guidance, authorizations, for our Department of Defense. When those authorizations are approved, the legislation goes to the Appropriations Committee for funding.It a good process, and other committees on Capitol Hill should do likewise. We recently shared with you a missive about how President Obama wants to dispatch SecDef Ash Carter to Capitol Hill to lobby against the NDAA. Obama has already stated he will veto the NDAA, unless he gets more authorization for domestic program spending ? after all, he does have to provide for all those vettedSyrian refugees ? and yes, I jest about the vettingthing. So yesterday and todayI spending time talking with Members and staffers about the NDAA on these key points: ? Reform of the weapons system procurement and acquisition process, where we waste massive amounts of taxpayer dollars. Example: the recent grounding of the F-35 combat aircraft. ? Reduction of the DoD bureaucracy and number of General and Flag officers. Example: there are more Admirals in the Navy than there are ships. Also, perhapsit time to consider if we really do need the Service Secretariats, i.e. Secretaries of the Army, Air Force and Navy. This is a redundant and duplicative structure. ? The necessity to properly fund the military for combat operations and also base functions, the latter being important for programs ensuring a quality of life for military family members. ? Better compensation, pay raises for our military, but a focus on our first term Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines who are paid at or below the poverty level. Two years ago, a report stated that $84M of food stamps were spent in our military commissaries ? unacceptable. This at a time when we have liberal progressives advocating for a ?living wage,? $15 minimum wage ? yeah, we want to pay greeters at Walmart better than the defenders of our liberties. All of those four points should seem easy to accommodate, right? Well, as Coach Lee Corso says on ESPN College Football Gameday, ?not so fast, my friend.? The NDAA is sitting in conference committee, meaning it awaits resolution between the House- and Senate-passed versions ? and funny enough, they are different; yeah, I know, dysfunctional huh? But remember, this document is required to authorize our military in FY 2017, which begins on 1 October 2016. The final consideration of the FY 2017 NDAA has been pushed back to the ?lame duck? session of Congress ? meaning, after the November election. So, our military is not sure of its guidance and direction for the upcoming fiscal year ? unacceptable. But, what REALLY had me scratching my head yesterday is one of the reasons why the FY17 NDAA is being held up. It was something I heard from several Congressional offices. And folks, you just cannot make this up. As reported by Politico: A BIRD IN THE HAND ? THE GREATER SAGE GROUSE IS ONCE AGAIN A KEY NDAA STICKING POINT: House and Senate negotiators are close to finalizing the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2017 fiscal year, but a provision involving the greater sage grouse remains a key sticking point, according to three people familiar with the negotiations. The sources told POLITICO the House provision that blocks the sage grouse from being listed as an endangered species has emerged as one of the last major items to be resolved between the House and Senate versions of the annual defense policy bill. The Senate billdoesn have a similar provision. ?My understanding is that there are short, chicken-like fowl problems still causing some question as to whether or notwe going to actually get it done,? said Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. That means other major differences between the chambers ? from acquisition reform to $18 billion in war funding ? have essentially been resolved, although aides noted nothing is final until the whole bill is completed. Several sources said a compromise was reached on topline funding to meet in the middle between the two bills.? A freaking bird, a doggone bird, is a sticking point in the resolution of our National Defense Authorization Act? Whether or not this chicken-like bird is listed on the endangered species act is part of our defense authorization legislation? Unfreakingbelievable! First, the Army is giving taxpayer-funded sex change operations to a convicted felon suffering from the mental condition called gender dysphoria, and now this? Now, I remember the days of the vaunted Desert Tortoise at the National Training Center in California. And some of you recall that rascal bird the red cockaded woodpecker that sealed off training areas at Ft. Bragg and Camp Lejeune, both in North Carolina. Heaven help you if during a night training exercise you ventured into a red cockaded woodpecker area ? you certainly faced a greater punishment than Hillary Clinton mishandling classified information. Folks, I like the environment, love Scuba diving and getting out on the open road on my motorcycle. But this is just over the top.We holding up our military over a bird? I justdon know where this is heading, but this is not a good indicator of a federal government honoring its most important mandate, ?provide for the common defense.? Maybe this is much ado about nothing, but sadly, it appears to be par for the course on Capitol Hill. However, this is something that this Obama administration, with their draconian agency called the EPA, is doing quite often.

"This should come as no surprise to most of us, but Trump supporter Don King let the ?N-word? slip out during a recent speech in an Ohio Church.It also unlikely thatyou be surprised at the fact that Trump was sitting right behind him, smiling with glee when it happened. CNN commentator Angela Rye spoke about this terrible incident with a Trump supporter, and the racism behind the Trump campaign got even worse. When Rye asked white Trump surrogate Joseph Borelli to ?Please tell me that you understand? how offensive it was to use the ?N-word? in 2016, shedidn quite get the answer she was hoping for. In fact, it was the exact opposite. The white panelist basically said that since rappers use the ?N-word?,it fair game for Don King and everyone else. Borelli said: ?Have you not listened to music where other African-Americans use language far worse than this?? Ryecouldn believe her ears, and gave Borelli a chance to save himself as she begged, ?Pleasedon do that to me. Pleasedon do that to me, today.? And of course, the dense Trump supporterdidn take the hint: ?I am going to do it, though. Youcan say that Don King is saying a word that is now suddenly unacceptable.It not one that I would use, butit perhaps a word that Don King would use.?That when Rye went off and tore him a new one. In making her point, Rye warned, ?WhatI saying to you, is this trivializes yourcandidate black outreach.?

"If convicted, Betty Shelby could face a minimum of four years in prison. | AP Photo Tulsa police officer charged with first-degree manslaughter in man's death TULSA, Okla. ? Prosecutors charged a white Oklahoma police officer with first-degree manslaughter Thursday, less than a week after she fatally shot an unarmed black man on a city street and just days after police released graphic videos, saying in court documents that the officer ""reacted unreasonably."" Tulsa County District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler charged Tulsa officer Betty Shelby in the Sept. 16 shooting death of 40-year-old Terence Crutcher. Kunzweiler said arrangements were being made for Shelby's surrender. Story Continued Below Shelby ""reacted unreasonably by escalating the situation from a confrontation with Mr. Crutcher, who was not responding to verbal commands and was walking away from her with his hands held up, becoming emotionally involved to the point that she over reacted,"" according to an affidavit filed with the charge. The swift action in Tulsa stood in contrast to Charlotte, North Carolina, where police refused under mounting pressure Thursday to release video of the shooting of another black man this week and the National Guard was called in to try to a head off a third night of violence. Demonstrations in Tulsa since Crutcher's death have been consistently peaceful. Dashcam and aerial footage of the shooting and its aftermath showed Crutcher walking away from Shelby with his arms in the air. The footage does not offer a clear view of when Shelby fired the single shot that killed Crutcher. Her attorney has said Crutcher was not following police commands and that Shelby opened fire when the man began to reach into his SUV window. But Crutcher's family immediately discounted that claim, saying the father of four posed no threat to the officers. They also pointed to an enlarged photo from police footage that appears to show Crutcher's window was rolled up. And police said Crutcher did not have gun on him or in his vehicle. An affidavit filed Thursday says Shelby told police homicide investigators that ""she was in fear for her life and thought Mr. Crutcher was going to kill her. When she began following Mr. Crutcher to the vehicle with her duty weapon drawn, she was yelling for him to stop and get on his knees repeatedly."" Crutcher was wearing ""baggy clothes"" but that Shelby ""was not able to see any weapons or bulges indicating a weapon was present,"" the affidavit states. Among the definitions in Oklahoma for first-degree manslaughter is a killing ""perpetrated unnecessarily either while resisting an attempt by the person killed to commit a crime, or after such attempt shall have failed."" If convicted, Shelby could face a minimum of four years in prison. Tulsa Mayor Dewey Bartlett said police worked quickly to provide Kunzweiler with the information he needed to decide whether to charge the officer. ""I appreciate their efforts as well as the District Attorney's usual thorough evaluation of the rules of law for which we are all accountable,"" Bartlett said in a written statement. ""These are important steps to ensure that justice and accountability prevails. ""We will continue to be transparent and ensure the system carries out its responsibility to provide justice."" Shelby, who joined the Tulsa Police Department in December 2011, was en route to a domestic violence call when she encountered Crutcher's vehicle abandoned on a city street, straddling the center line. Shelby did not activate her patrol car's dashboard camera, so no footage exists of what first happened between the two before other officers arrived. The police footage shows Crutcher approaching the driver's side of the SUV, then more officers walk up and Crutcher appears to lower his hands and place them on the vehicle. A man inside a police helicopter overhead says: ""That looks like a bad dude, too. Probably on something."" Police Sgt. Dave Walker has said investigators found a vial of the drug PCP in Crutcher's vehicle. Shelby's attorney, Scott Wood, has said that Shelby completed drug-recognition expert training and thought Crutcher was acting like he might be under the influence of PCP. Attorneys for Crutcher's family said the family didn't know whether drugs were found in the SUV, but that even if they were, it wouldn't justify the shooting. A toxicology report could take several weeks. In the videos, the officers surround Crutcher and he suddenly drops to the ground. A voice heard on police radio says: ""Shots fired!"" The officers back away and Crutcher is left unattended on the street for about two minutes before an officer puts on medical gloves and begins to attend to him. ""The tragic circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Crutcher are on the hearts and minds of many people in this community,"" Kunzweiler said. ""It's important to note that despite the heightened tensions felt by all, which seemingly beg for an emotional response and reaction, our community has consistently demonstrated the willingness to respect the judicial process."" At least two dozen people gathered outside the courthouse after the district attorney announced the charges, with some saying they were not happy that Shelby wasn't charged with first-degree murder. ""We will be out here every single day until she gets murder,"" Tulsa resident Tammi Sims said. Earlier this year, a former volunteer deputy with the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office was sentenced to four years in prison after he was convicted of second-degree manslaughter in the shooting death of Eric Harris, who was also black and unarmed.",0.040625,0.0046875,0.009375,0.0140625,0.0703125,0.240625,0.0,2,-1,1
"Donald Trump got off to a great start during Mondaynight debate, his first presidential debate with Hillary Clinton. But his performancewasn without bumps. So, did Trump appear like a legitimate candidate tonight? And did Hillary maintain her status as a policy wonk who knows her stuff ? Was she able to fend off claims that she is shrill? And what of the moderator? Was Lester Holt a moderator, or was he a third debater and onHilary side, at that? This was a very historic debate, certainly. Hillary Clinton, the first female candidate from a major party, met Donald Trump, one of the first political neophytes and businessmen to gain the nomination of a major party, are engaged in an election that for many is about all the marbles. Many, both left and right, feel that if their candidatedoesn win it will be a catastrophe for the nation. While Democrats feel that if Trump wins they may end up in the political wilderness for decades, Republicans are equally sure that if Hillary wins she will finish the destruction of the nation started by Barack Obama. What ever might happen in the months to come, this, the first of three debates, did not endTrump campaign. He held his own well enough againstHillary wonky demeanor, and was able to stand toe-to-toe with her for the entire 90-minute debate. He alsodidn commit any major gaffes and pulled the reins back on the sort of extreme combativeness we saw from him during his primary debates. But Trump missed a lot of opportunities and seemed on the defensive throughout. While he was still forceful and in places combative, Trump was able to successfully slam home one message. His main line of attack during the night was that Hillary has spent 30 years in government leading this nation with the polices she advocated tonight, yet this nation is failing and our world is more dangerous than ever. Donald Trump wondered aloud how all her wonderful plans would change anything that shehasn been able to change in her 20 years in power? In the end, though, Trump did not hurt himself in this debate, something that will surely discourage liberals supporting Hillary. It is doubtful that Trump lost any supporters even as he may not have picked up any new acolytes. As to Hillary, shedidn get shrill and even once or twice seemed to respond like a real human might. She seemed in command of her ideas and generally kept an even tone. In the final analysis, though, this outing should likely be scored as something of a tie and in that case the challenger might be awarded a bit of a win. After all, this wasTrump first one-on-one presidential debate against a candidate who has been in a dozen of them over two presidential campaigns yet he was able to keep he head about him and say mostly on track with only a few instances where he got bogged down.He likely get even better at this over the next two outings. As to moderator Holt, it was clear he bowed to pressure from his pals on the left to become the third candidate on the stage. He constantly interrupted Trump and was clearly onHillary side throughout the night. By contrast he almost never interrupted Hillary. The night started with moderator Lester Holt opening the debate with questions on the economy. Like a Democrat does, Hillary essentially answered to the question of how she would fix thisnation faltering economy by unloading yet another laundry list of big government programs. In fact, her entire appeal seemed to be fully centered on Democrat tactics of the 1990s. Hillary insisted that her tax plan would help small businesses create jobs. And yet, she made this claim only days after releasing her confiscatory estate tax plan that critics say would make sure no family farm or small business could ever be passed down from parent to child because her tax rate is so high that families would have to sell those businesses and farms to pay her 65 percent taxes hit. This sort of uncertainty is not a builder of small business. It is a destroyer of them. When Holt turned to Trump, the GOP candidate went into his familiar ?Americadoesn win any more? talking points and added that his tax cut plan would be the biggest since RonaldReagan and would send the economy booming again. Incidentally, this is precisely whatHillary husband, Bill Clinton, did in the mid 1990s to reverse the economic disaster he set in motion with his own disastrous tax hike. When he first came to office, Bill bowed to the left of his party and raised taxes but after his party was wiped out in the 1994 midterm elections because the economy was sinking under his policies he abruptly changed direction, lowered taxes, and helped bring back national prosperity. This is a lesson Hillary obviously has not learned if her high tax policy is any indication. In any case, Trump hit over and over on his claim that we need to stop American jobs and businesses from fleeing the country and noted thatHillary policies are little different thanObama and that she would not be able to stop jobs from leaving America. Incidentally, the segment was another example of Lester Holt joining team Hillary as he insisted callingTrump tax plan ?tax cuts for the wealthy? when in fact his plan would cut taxes for 60 percent of U.S. households. In response, Hillary threw out one of her catch phrases callingTrump policy ?Trumped up trickle down,? in a tactic again reminiscent of tired old 1990s liberal talking points. The Democrat nominee also claimed that her massive tax hike would create 10 million jobs, a claim that is hard to fathom. Sadly Trump missed the opportunity to note that this is the same lie Obama used when he took office and his reputation as a jobs creator is dismal, indeed. Trump could have pointed out howHillary nonsense is just likeObama and we have a sluggish economy with millions out of work as a result. Another tactic Hillary employed early and often throughout the debate was to urge the media to ?fact check? Trump. This is just a continuation of her coordination with the same media that put out a slew of Trump hit pieces three days before the debate. Trump went on to hit Hillary on the NAFTA and TPP trade polices as he has been doing for months, now. What ever you feel about NAFTA, Hillary did not mount a very effective response toTrump accusation and indeed she used a false claim against Trump as she did so. Hillary insisted that Trump cheered the housing crisis when people were losing their homes late in the 2000s. Hillary has uttered this lie many times, but even CNN noted that the claim is not true. Trump did not celebrate people losing their homes. The issue ofTrump tax returns next came up but Trump got the better of Hillary with the question and got the crowd to break its pledge of silence at the same time. When the partisan Holt asked Trump ifhe release his tax returns, he replied, ?I?ll release my tax returns when she releases her 33,000 emails that she deleted.? The crowd erupted in cheers but were then scolded by Holt for breaking the silence pledge.Hillary only real response was to Harry Reid-like claim that Trumpdoesn want to release his taxes because he has never paid any federal taxes at all. However her attack line on Trump has been proven incorrect even by the so-called ?fact checkers? she kept trying to press into service to go after Trump. Fact check site Politifact has saidHillary claim that Trump paid no taxes is ?mostly false.? Trump also made some great points when he noted that the U.S.A. is a ?serious debtor nation? with an infrastructure that is falling apart and the nation needs a new leader who ?has an idea about money.? Moderator Holt then moved onto the the racial divide and in her answer Hillary insisted thatAmerica police are racists who need re-education. In her opinion, our police are ?implicitly biased? against blacks. Trump then reminded America that it was Hillary who said that blacks were ?super predators,? a statement she later had to apologize for. But Trump hit a bad spot when asked to once again respond to his former birtherism. Trump rambled and was not able to successfully reply to the issue on stage. Hillary made herself look petty, though. when she calledTrump birtherism a ?racist lie.? Whatever you believe about where Obama was born, the issue has nothing to do with his race. It has to do with his citizenship. Thatwasn the end ofHillary name calling. She later directly called Trump a racist, as well, for his words against the importation of Muslim terrorists. Hillary also said Trump is anti-woman despite the fact that Trump employs more women in high positions than most big New York companies. The attacks gave Trump a good opening to reiterate that Hillary has spend hundreds of millions of campaign dollars on vicious attack ads on TV, yet despite the expenditure, the two candidates are virtually tied in the polls. The lie about Trump being a racist was far from the only lie Clinton told this night. Clinton also disgorged a series of other lies during the debate. In one case Hillary insisted that when she becameObama Secretary of State Iran was ?weeks away? from having a nuclear bomb. But in truth there is no intelligence estimate from any country that supports her claim. Clinton also insisted she was against the Trans Pacific Trade agreement in its early stages. But in fact, Hillary called the TPP scheme the ?gold standard? of trade agreements and was a major supporter of the plan. So, what did we end up with last night? As noted above, the night was more or less a tie. No one who supports either candidate would have been swayed to abandon their support. Neither came away with any knock out blows and both held their own. We move on to round two wondering if we may yet see something that might become a game changer. But the immediate post debate period was interesting in that it showed what sort of candidate Trump really is. As is usual for a presidential candidate after a debate, Hillary Clinton disappeared after waving to supporters. But Trump made himself available to the media right away.Trump talking to Sean Hannity and other members of the media as he exited the stage marks a first for a presidential candidate and it only goes to highlight the fact that Hillary went well over 200 days before speaking to the media while Trump has made himself available the whole campaign. So, what did you think of the debate? Tell us in the comments below.",0.032229965,0.006968640999999999,0.009581882,0.032229965,0.055749129,0.37195122,0.006097561,2,-1,1
"This is hot off the presses folks ? something dangerous is going on in the New York City metro area. At around 12:40 AM Monday morning police were alerted to a suspicious backpack near a trashcan in an Elizabeth, New Jersey trashcan. The men who reported it said they could see a pipe and wires sticking out of the bag. When police arrived they discovered FIVE different devices but when a bomb squad robot approached the bag one of the devices exploded, fortunately no one was injured. UPDATE: Elizabeth, NJ mayor says five devices found in bag near train station. One exploded while bomb squad robot tried to disarm it ? Fox News (@FoxNews) September 19, 2016 The latest bomb scare comes just one day after two other bombs exploded (one in Seaside Park, New Jersey and one in Manhattan) and three more were found by authorities before they could be detonated. Late Sunday evening authorities announced that they believed all five bombs from Saturday were the work of the same people, then later in the night they announced that they had made five arrests in connection with the bombs. Federal authorities conducted a traffic stop of a ?vehicle of interest? in the Chelsea bombing Sunday night in Brooklyn. A law enforcement source told Fox News that a ?number of individuals? who are possibly connected to the explosion were taken into custody. Law enforcement officials told the Associated Press that at least 5 men were being questioned. The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about an ongoing investigation. The FBI said in a statement that no one had been charged with any crime and the investigation was ongoing. There is no word yet if the latest group of bombs found in Elizabeth, are connected to the just detained persons of interest. Elizabeth, New Jersey Mayor, Christian Bollwage speaking to the media about the bomb (you can see more video from the scene here): UPDATE: The man sought in connection with the bombings in Manhattan and Seaside Park, New Jersey has been captured after a shootout with police.

NBC New York (@NBCNewYork) September 19, 2016 Ahmad Khan Rahami is a Muslim man of Afghani origin who was living in Elizabeth, New Jersey (the city where the bombs were found late last night/early this morning). Authorities had launched a dragnet earlier Monday in search of the 28-year-old Afghan-born man, whom they described as being ?armed and dangerous? A naturalized U.S. citizen, Rahami was wanted for questioning regarding the Saturday night blast in NewYork Chelsea neighborhood, an explosion in NewJersey Seaside Park on Saturday morning and a foiled bomb attack Sunday night near a train station in Elizabeth, NJ. An eyewitness toRahami capture in Linden, NJ told Fox News that he saw a man walking down a street with a gun in his hand. A police car pulled up next to him and the man fired at cops 4-6 times. The shooter then began running down the street with several police cars trailing him, the witness, Peter Bilinskas, said. After days of pretending that the bombings were not the work of Islamic terrorists it seems that NewYork liberals are finally beginning to understand the truth. If a bomb goes off on American soil, it is more likely than not the work of Muslim terrorists. ?Today I believewe going to find out that [the bombing] was influenced by foreign sources,? Gov.

"Blue Bell just did the one thing we all hoped would never happen again, this is a nightmare. In 2015 we were all devastated when our favorite ice cream had a HUGE recall taking it off the shelves for months. This was their first recall in over 100 years! Eventually toward the end of 2016 we started seeing Blue Bell back out on the shelves, but now there has been another recall on the products! The company is now voluntarily recalling several of their ice-cream products because they are concerned that they may contain ?listeria bacteria?. Unfortunately, they have recalled two of their products that contain chocolate chip cookie dough. Blue Bell stated that the dough was being made by a third party known as Aspen Hills Inc. The good news is that therehaven been any reports of illness from the ice cream but Blue Bell is wanting to take precautions before their are any. The company posted the recall on their Facebook yesterday. ?Out of an abundance of caution, we are voluntarily recalling select products that contain a chocolate chip cookie dough ingredient. Aspen Hills, Inc., who supplies us with this ingredient, has issued a voluntary recall on select lots of chocolate chip cookie dough supplied to Blue Bell. No illnesses have been reported to date, but Blue Bell is taking this step because we remain committed to producing a safe, high-quality, great-tasting ice cream for you and your family to enjoy.? Apparently the ice cream was distributed in 10 states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.

In 1959, JoyceWharton parents boarded a plane bound for Seattle. The plane crashed and her parents were never heard from again.

"Donald Trump's campaign isn't alone in patronizing his own businesses: taxpayers are indirectly doing so, too. Federal Election Commission records show that the U.S. Secret Service has paid the Trump campaign about $1.6 million to cover the cost of flying its agents with the candidate on a plane owned and operated by one of his companies. Story Continued BelowIt standard practice for the agency ? which is tasked with protecting presidential candidates as well as presidents and other federal officials ? to reimburse presidential campaigns for the cost of traveling with the candidates. In fact, the Secret Service has reimbursed the Clinton campaign, too: $2.6 million so far this cycle. The difference with Trump is that one of his companies, TAG Air, Inc., owns the plane, so the government is effectively paying him. The Clinton campaign, by contrast, mostly has been chartering planes from a private company called Executive Fliteways in which the Clintons do not have any ownership interest. ?The taxpayers are actually reimbursing Trump for the travel of the Secret Service agents,"" said Brett Kappel, a campaign finance lawyer at the law firm Akerman LLP. ""It's just another example of how the Trump campaign has taken an unprecedentedly large amount of its money and spent it at Trump-owned facilities.""

A POLITICO analysis of FEC records found that, through the end of August,Trump campaign has spent at least $8.2 million at Trump's own businesses, including to hold events at his hotels, buy food from his restaurants and rent office space for its headquarters in his Manhattan office tower. But the biggest chunk of the expenses, almost $6 million, were to TAG Air, Inc. Trump, who once said ?I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it,? has attracted criticism for mixing business and politics to an unprecedented degree. He has made a point of highlighting his properties on the campaign trail, leading opponents to accuse him of using his presidential bid to promote his brand and line his pockets. The campaign in a statement on Thursday rejected that criticism as ?misleading and flat out wrong,? pointing out that the amount the campaign spent at Trump's businesses is far less than the $54 million of his own money that Trump has pumped into the campaign. The statement explained thecampaign payments to TAG Air and other Trump-owned companies by saying ?the campaign has used known quantities as far as event space, air travel and accommodations, and has fulfilled all FEC requirements throughout the campaign.? The government's practice of reimbursing campaigns for costs incurred by their Secret Service details dates from an era when campaigns were lower-budget affairs, the logic being candidates shouldn't have to use their own resources on required security, according to Craig Engle, a political lawyer at Arent Fox who helped draft the provision as a staffer at the Federal Election Commission. ""It's basically just calling it even,"" Engle said. ""It's either Trump making a contribution to the U.S. government, or the U.S. government reimburses the Trump campaign for its expenses."" The same rationale applies to journalists who travel with the presidential candidates. The journalists or their employers reimburse the campaigns for travel costs. Soit conceivable that media outlets might end up paying the Trump campaign for the cost of staying in a Trump-owned hotel or flying on a Trump-owned plane. The Secret Service could also end up paying Trump's hotels to put up his agents when the candidate stays there. But those expenses don't appear in FEC reports because the government pays them directly. The agency paid the Trump campaign an additional $724,000 for air travel that was refunded, according to the FEC reports, which do not offer an explanation for the refund. Of course, Trump also travels on the campaign trail with his own robust private security detail. In August,Trump campaign spent $232,800 on security-related costs, including payments to private companies such as Xmark LLC, Black Tie Protection Services and KS Global Group, as well as local police in places he visited.",0.021032505,0.0019120460000000001,0.0,0.009560229,0.036328872000000005,0.244741874,0.0,2,-1,1

"The ?designated survivor? has long been one ofWashington favorite parlorgames what America would be like if a catastrophe befell the capital during a State of the Union and the most powerful office in the land were delivered unwittingly to the cabinet official who had been hidden away as the president-of-last-resort. What would America have looked like under President Jeh Johnson (2016)? President Ernest Moniz (2014)? Or even President Alberto Gonzales (2007)? And then there are the weirder examples: In 2001, had a catastrophe occurred during the inauguration, Americans expecting Republican President George W. Bush might have instead found themselves with a Democratic president named Larry Summers. The idea is startling enough to fuel a new Kiefer Sutherland TV drama, Designated Survivor, in which the 24 actor plays a hapless Housing and Urban Development Secretary who finds himself ushered into the White House after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol. Story Continued Below You might assume that for something as important as presidential succession, the world's most powerful nation has it down to a science.That the scenario that Hollywood lays out in the show premiere tonight: Sutherland, who just minutes before had been headed to political obscurity in a low-profile ambassadorship, is instead ushered into the White House by an efficient set of government minders. But in reality, the system is far less clearly delineated, and dogged by questions that are likely to begin the momentit pressed into action.I spent the last three years researching a forthcoming book on thegovernment doomsday plans, and one fact that emerged starkly is just how uncertain the whole process is. The system of presidential succession is relatively new, and in many cases it's surprisingly unclear who becomes president. As legal scholar Akhil Amar, who had long studied the legalities of succession, told Congress during one hearing after 9/11, ?The current Presidential succession Act, 3 U.S.C. section 19, is in my view a disastrous statute, an accident waiting to happen. It should be repealed and replaced.? Indeed, the presidential succession plan is the rare Washington storythat evenstranger contains even more unexpectedtwists the Hollywood version. For one thing, the system, known as ?continuity of government,? is vastly larger and more complicated than most people realize. While attention usually focuses on the main presidential successor, during high-profile events a much broader shadow government often waits in secure undisclosed locations. During PresidentObama inauguration in 2009, when Defense Secretary Robert Gates was the designated presidential successor, JamesClapper the undersecretary of defense forintelligence out the swearing-in at thePentagon secret Cold War bunker in Pennsylvania known as Raven Rock, ready to step into Gates? role as defense secretary if the need arose. But the even weirder thing is what might happen after a disaster. In fact, had Gates emerged from a cave to claim the presidency on January 20, 2009, itmight only marked the opening gambit in a legal drama that could have played out for days, weeks, or even months as a variety of officials from all three branches of government argued over who could rightfully claim the presidency. *** For about three hours the designated survivor teeters on the edge of becoming the most important person in the world. That moment in thespotlight, more accurately, far from thespotlight be brief. The night in 1997 Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman served as the ?designated survivor? during one of PresidentClinton addresses to Congress, Glickman went to New York for the night, with a security detail and thenation nuclear codes in tow, only to find that as soon as the speech wasfinished the need for a successorover security apparatus abandoned him, leaving him in the rain to catch his own taxi home. The idea of a ?designated survivor? was formalized by the Carter and Reagan administrations, as White House officials worried about nuclear missiles aboard Soviet submarines that lay off the Atlantic Coast and could have devastated the capital with barely 10 minutes? notice. PresidentCarter White House Military Office in April 1980 had instituted new procedures with FEMA to monitor the attendance of all presidential successors ?at major, publicly announced functions outside the White House complex.? While such gatherings of the U.S. leadership had been commonplace in thepast inaugurations, states of the union, state funerals and thelike rising tensions of the Cold War made government planners questions their wisdom. ?The situation provides an inviting target to enemy attack or terrorist activity, and represents an unnecessary risk to national leadership,? the White House Military Office wrote, outlining the new procedures. The 25thAmendment a modern relic of the Cold War and fears of nuclearattack out a seemingly clear line for presidential succession. It flows from the vice president to the House speaker to the Senate president pro tem, then through the cabinet in the order in which the departments werecreated quirk that itself makes the Department of Homeland Security secretary, one of the people best qualified to actually assume the presidency in a disaster, actually last in line. When all those in the line of succession were gathered in a high-profile setting, FEMA was to notify the White House and an aide would recommend to the president which qualified cabinet successors should skip the event. (Constitutionally, foreign-born cabinet secretaries, like current Interior Secretary SallyJewell Brit!?don?t serve in the line of succession.) It falls to a little-known branch of FEMA, the Central Locator Service, to track the whereabouts of the successors daily, and once a month, after the fact, audit a single day to determine whether it had correctly known where each cabinet member was. The new White House and FEMA procedures got their first test atReagan inaugural. The incoming and outgoing administrations had agreed thatCarter outgoing defense secretary, Harold Brown, would remain in office past the standard noon departure and ensure that there was a national leader in case something catastrophic happened at the ceremony. ?Both sides agreed that something should be done,? a FEMA official explained later. Brown only resigned later on inauguration day once the Reagan team was firmly in control ofgovernment levers. The ?designated survivor? program would grow more formal in the years tocome chosen Cabinet member would receive a Secret Service detail for the length of the event and a White House military aide would arrive for the evening with one of the emergency briefcases known as the ?Football,? which contain instructions on how to access thenation nuclear weaponscodes case the unthinkable happened and the designated survivor needed to be ready to launch an attack. The ?designated survivor? program, though, raised a new problem: How would the ?designated survivor? prove he or she was actually now the president? The government lacked simple procedures for figuring out how to double-check thatperson identity after a decapitation event. Is the person at the other end of the phone really Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack (State of the Union 2012)? ?One of the things we discovered is that there was no authentication system,?Reagan first FEMA head Louis Giuffrida said in 1981. ?If a successor got on the horn and said, ?I?m the successor,? and somebody said ?Prove it,? [no one could]. Sowe working on that, and FEMA will be the authenticating mechanism to say, ?Yeah, thisguy for real. Thepresident gone and wedon know where the vice presidentis this is the man.?? In the years ahead, FEMA and the White House worked out an elaborate (and classified) system through which a successor would be able to confirm his or her identity, and in subsequent years the ?designated survivors? became a common part of Washington lore, and often yielded amusing stories from those who served. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala recounted the story of how she watched the 1996 State of the Union from the White House and ordered pizza. ?I took my staff with me and I ordered pizza for them in the Roosevelt Room,? she said years later. ?I went to the Oval Office and for one minute sat in the president's chair and then I got up respectfully and went to watch the speech with my staff.? Yet, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, a bipartisan commission examining thenation succession planning found thatoddtroubling persisted that could lead to serious constitutional quandaries in just the sort of situation that KieferSutherland character, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Tom Kirkman, experiences in the TV show. As clear as the line of succession may appear on paper, legally it would likely prove a much messier proposition the further down the list you go and cabinet officials become involved. And it could get particularly tangled if the president or vice president is only ?incapacitated,? rather than killed outright.It not entirely clear, even, that the House speaker or the Senate president pro tem could legally serve as president. Republican Senator John Coryn raised the question during the debate in the early 2000s of what would happen if a speaker of the House or Senate president pro tem ascended to thepresidency then was challenged by the secretary of state who argued that the legislatorsdidn count as constitutional officers, making them ineligible to serve in the presidency. ?Believe it or not, the secretary actually has a rather strong case, in my view,? Cornyn said. No less an authority than James Madison himself had argued that the congressional leaders were legislators, not constitutional officers, and thus ineligible to succeed to the presidency. As Cornyn said, ?Who is the president? Whose orders should be followed by our armed forces, by our intelligence agencies and by domestic law enforcement bureaus? If law suits are filed, will courts accept jurisdiction? How long will they take to rule? How will they rule? And how will their rulings be respected?? In the years after 9/11, the so-called ?Continuity of Government Commission,? pushed by American Enterprise Institute scholar Norm Ornstein, who has assumed the role ofWashington succession Cassandra and has spent much of the last 20 years raising troubling questions about the 25thAmendment ambiguities, confronted one of the strangest and most nettlesome phrases in COGoperations.It a seemingly unnecessary aside in the language guiding presidential succession known as the ?supplantation clause,? which held that a ?prior-entitled? presidential successor, that is someone who ranks higher in the official line of succession, could supplant a lower-level Cabinet official who was serving as ?acting president.? For instance, in a situation where the president and the congressional leadership was killed, but the vice president only incapacitated, the secretary of state would presumably serve as ?acting president? until the vice president was able to resume his or her responsibility and become the president. But the ?supplantation clause? inserted unhelpful ambiguity: Could, after Congress reconstitutes itself, a newly elected speaker of the House or Senate president pro tem insist on replacing the secretary of state even after that person had assumed the office of ?acting president?? Could a newly elected speaker supplant a president pro tem? Might the presidency swing wildly in a few days, at the height of a crisis, between different officials and different political parties? The Continuity of Government Commission tried also to tackle an ongoing problem with presidential succession that had dogged the debate for decades: Even with the idea of designated survivors for major high-profile gatherings and all the evacuation systems in place, on a day-to-day basis everyone in the presidential line of succession lives and works in a tiny radius extending a few miles around the White House and the Capitol. ?In the nightmare scenario of terrorists detonating a nuclear device, it is possible that everyone in the line of succession might be killed,? thecommission executive director, John Fortier, told Congress during one hearing. ?Imagine the aftermath: a parade of generals, governors, and under secretaries claiming to be in charge.? It would be the chaos of AlHaig ?I?m in control here? statement during the Reagan administration writ larger and more fraught. One proposal, floated during the post-9/11 discussions, would have created a ?First Secretary,? a Cabinet official who would have been first-in-line to the presidency after the vice president and whose sole responsibility would be to remain outside of Washington and be the designated survivor to head the shadow government if a catastrophic event destroyed the capital. It would be a job, in essence, to remain in an ?undisclosed location? until the worst moment of American history. * * * Such questions make the nation, under existing rules, particularly vulnerable during presidential inaugurations. The terms of the president and vice president constitutionally expire at noon on January 20th, but their cabinets remained in office until either a resignation is tendered or a successor is confirmed by theSenate usuallydoesn happen for hours or even days after an inauguration. In 2001, as Fortier, the commission leader explained, a terror attack that targeted George W.Bush inauguration, might have left the nation with a president carried over from the previous administration who would then serve until Congress had a speaker or president pro tem who would bumpout the president and serve the rest of the four-year term of office. Fortier said, ?A country expecting Republican George W. Bush to take office would have found themselves with a Democratic President Larry Summers. As secretary of the treasury, Summers was the highest-ranking Clinton Cabinet member eligible to serve as President.? In 1989, at George H.W.Bush inauguration, the situation would have been even more confusing, with the same strange outcome: Michael Armacost, the number three official atReagan State Department, would have been elevated to president of the United States, for the outgoing secretary of state, George Shultz, and deputy secretary of state, John C. Whitehead, had both resigned before the inauguration. Then, with the House in Democratic hands, a newly chosen speaker could have bumped Armacost and given the nation four years of Democratic rule immediately after it elected a Republican president. In fact, given that the Senate took five days to confirm James Baker as secretary of state afterBush inauguration, Armacost remained fourth in line to the presidency for the better part of a week. Armacost went on to serve as president of the Brookings Institution and Summers went on to serve as president of Harvard University, so both men ended up with the title of ?President,?but an unprecedented crisis summoned them to lead in 1989 or2001?s hard to imagine that the ascension of either man to the American presidency would have proved reassuring to the nation in its moment of need. Unless KieferSutherland drama reopens the debate, there are no plans to fix any ofthese a host ofother with presidential succession. Congress tabled and ignored the fixes on the table a decade ago, and except for a few lonely congressional voices in the years since, like Rep. Brian Baird,there been little attention since.

"DeRay McKesson said police need to start being held accountable for the violence. | AP Photo Black Lives Matter's McKesson says police must be held accountable in latest shootings The latest shootings by police of black men show that little has been done to reduce the violence at the hands of law enforcement, Black Lives Matter activist DeRay McKesson said on Wednesday, as he expressed frustration over the frequency of such incidents. ""Police kill almost three people everyday,"" McKesson told POLITICO, as unrest simmers over the two deaths of black men by police over the past week. ""We have to hold the police accountable for their actions."" Story Continued Below Protests shook the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, overnight and into the early morning after a black man was shot dead by police Tuesday night. The demonstrations, which at times turned violent, spilled over into the apartment complex where Keith Lamont Scott was killed. Charlotte police maintain that Scott stepped out of his vehicle with a gun when officers arrived at the scene, but his family disputes this claim, saying he was sitting in his car reading a book. The Charlotte Police Department could not be immediately reached for comment. The shooting comes as racial tensions were already high across the country after police shot dead an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Oklahoma last week. Terence Crutcher's family says officer Betty Shelby inappropriately fired on him after their SUV broke down, while her lawyer contends that Crutcher was acting suspiciously and appeared to be reaching inside the vehicle for a gun. While the shootings have again grabbed national headlines ? and attention from the two presidential candidates ? McKesson said police need to start being held accountable for the violence, and that he hopes there are consequences for the officers in the most recent fatal shootings. ""[I'm] looking forward to how this plays out in terms of criminal charges,? said McKesson, who was an early leader of the Black Lives Matter movement and co-founded Campaign Zero, the first effort to organize activists around a set of policies to stop police violence. McKesson said while the federal government has a role to play in reforming police behavior, the onus is really on local departments to change their ways. ""What's he to say?"" he said when asked if President Barack Obama is doing enough to combat police violence, adding ""The Department of Justice could reduce funding to local police departments, and they haven't really done that aggressively.? In the meantime, McKesson said he would continue trying to draw attention to the issue. Campaign Zero on Wednesday launched a new project at useofforceproject.org, which takes a look at 91 of 100 police departments in the biggest cities in the United States. The report examines the use of force policies of the departments and concludes whether there are basic protections against police violence in the policies. ""Many police departments fail to establish common sense restrictions on police use of force ? including deadly force ? that would actually benefit the communities they are supposed to protect and serve,"" the report states. ""According to our findings, fundamentally changing use of force policies can dramatically reduce the number of people killed by police in America."" ""The police has a shadow system that almost guarantees they won't be held accountable,"" McKesson said, adding that these policies, and the lack of provisions to safeguard against police violence make it extremely difficult to reduce these incidents from recurring.",0.050359712,0.0,0.002398082,0.021582734,0.067146283,0.30215827300000003,0.0,2,-1,1
"Washington  The battle over gun rights returned to the nation's capital Tuesday, as a federal appeals court took up a challenge to a restriction that requires applicants for a license to carry a concealed firearm to demonstrate a ""good reason"" to fear injury to his or her person or property. ""This is the most important question in the Second Amendment today,"" said Adam Winkler of UCLA School of Law. ""Whether people can carry guns in public and under what conditions is a major battleground."" Lawyers for District of Columbia called the license restriction an ""important public safety law"" and argued before a panel of the US District Court for the District of Columbia that the law should be allowed to remain in effect pending appeal. ""This case is in its infancy,"" said Holly M. Johnson, an assistant attorney general for the District. But challengers asked the court to block it, arguing that ""very few people"" will be able to demonstrate that they are eligible for the permit. The three judges hearing the challenge were all nominated by Republican presidents. Judge Thomas Griffith, a George W. Bush nominee, asked by far the most questions on the bench. He noted there is a ""long history"" of courts sustaining bans on concealed carry, but, joined by Judge Stephen Williams, a Ronald Reagan appointee, he repeatedly questioned the scope of the DC permit requirement. More than once he asked about someone who lived in a dangerous neighborhood but had never been attacked who might not qualify for the permit. Griffith asked whether someone had to be ""attacked first."" Griffith noted that only a handful of other states have similar laws. The third judge, Karen Henderson, a George H. W. Bush nominee, did not ask a question. One of biggest cases since Heller Eight years ago, it was another Washington gun ordinance that triggered a landmark Supreme Court opinion -- District of Columbia v. Heller -- that held for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to bear arms. The opinion capped off a decades-long debate on whether the right applied only in connection to service in a state militia. Back in 2008, the law at issue concerned a total ban on handguns in the home. Tuesday's case deals with weapons outside the home. Gun rights advocates thought that Heller -- penned by the late Justice Antonin Scalia -- would encourage courts to strike down restrictions across the country. That didn't happen. Instead, many courts relied upon a different part of Scalia's opinion where he cautioned that the Second Amendment should not be understood as conferring a ""right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose."" Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has declined to take up any follow-up cases. How Scalia will be replaced has become a major issue in the presidential race. Donald Trump has pledged to appoint conservative justices in the mold of Scalia. Trump's GOP primary rival, Ted Cruz, consistently name-checked the Heller decision. Hillary Clinton has advocated for stronger gun control laws. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama's nominee for the bench, Judge Merrick Garland, waits on the sidelines. The DC law at issue in Tuesday's case is based on similar provisions in New York, Maryland and New Jersey. Several plaintiffs are challenging the law, including Matthew Grace, who says he was denied a permit in 2016 because he had failed to show a ""good or proper reason"" to support his request for a license. He owns four lawfully registered handguns and seeks to carry them outside the home for self-defense. Grace's case and a similar one brought by different plaintiffs split two different district court judges reviewing the law. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia will hear both appeals on Tuesday. ""The District of Columbia has spent the last four decades trying to drain the Second Amendment of any meaning,"" Charles Cooper, a lawyer representing Grace and other plaintiffs, argued in court papers. Cooper objects to the fact that DC officials have given themselves the power to decide ""on a case-by-case basis"" whether an applicant has ""good reason"" to obtain a license to carry a concealed gun. He says that such a power is ""categorically irreconcilable"" with the Second Amendment. ""Nearly a decade after Heller, the District of Columbia still refuses to treat the right to bear arms as a genuine constitutional right,"" he said. In their briefs, lawyers for the District of Columbia point out that Washington is ""unique"" in that it is filled with thousands of high ranking federal officials, and diplomats and it hosts hundreds of heavily attended events annually including political marches and protests. Citing Supreme Court precedent, they argue that the ""Second Amendment preserves the ability of local jurisdictions to devise solutions to social problems that suit local needs and values, and that is precisely what the Council has done through the 'good reason' standard."" DC is supported by lawyers for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, who emphasize that from 2014 to 2015, the homicide rate in the District increased 54%. ""The District may meet or surpass that tragic record in 2016,"" Jonathan Lowy, an attorney for the Brady Center, argued in briefs. He pointed out that in one DC area -- Ward 7 -- homicides have tripled so far this year. ""It is critical that law enforcement maintain its longstanding authority to prevent the rampant carrying of guns in public places,"" Lowy said in an interview. ""It would be an extraordinary and radical shift for a court to find that law enforcement has no authority to reasonably regulate the carrying of hidden handguns in public."" But the National Rifle Association counters that while DC officials are ""rightly concerned about violent crime,"" the ""Constitution affords them considerable discretion in addressing the problem. "" ""The Second Amendment's protection of the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms' necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table."" NRA's lawyer Paul Clement argued in court briefs. ""Municipal leaders, no matter how well-intentioned, cannot simply enact any gun control law that they deem to be reasonable.""",0.016282225,0.0027137040000000004,0.009497965,0.005427408000000001,0.052917232,0.286295794,0.0027137040000000004,2,-1,1

While the question itself is unclear, a woman can be heard asking about a microphone, prompting Clinton to take a scathing parting shot at her opponent, as evidenced by the audible reaction (which included a group ?oooh?) on the plane. ?Anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night,?

"Story highlights Trump would have more paths to the White House should those states become more competitive Trump has closed the gap considerably with Clinton over the past month Washington (CNN) Donald Trump's rebound in national polls extends to four swing states in which he has either narrowed the margin by which he trailed Hillary Clinton or extended his lead over her, according to a new poll. A Quinnipiac University survey released Thursday shows Trump trailing by just 2 points in Colorado, a state where Clinton had opened up a wide lead and where Democrats had halted advertising. Clinton is ahead 44% to 42%, within the poll's margin of error. It's a similarly tightened race in Virginia, where ads had similarly stopped, as Clinton leads by 6 points, 45% to 39%. In Georgia, Trump is now up by 7 points, 47% to 40%, putting some distance between himself and Clinton in what is typically a reliably Republican state. And in Iowa, which has leaned in Trump's direction for the entire general election, he is also up by 7 points, 44% to 37%.

"Orlando, Florida  Hillary Clinton faces off against Donald Trump on the debate stage for the first time on Monday night, in a crucial prime-time event that could alter the narrative of the presidential election just six weeks out from Election Day. CNN interviewed Clinton supporters in Orlando Wednesday afternoon, at what is expected to be the Democratic nominee's last public campaign event before the first debate. We asked what they think Clinton needs to do to outperform Trump, and what her biggest vulnerability might be under the spotlight. One woman said Clinton should keep her cool if Trump tries to provoke her. Another urged Clinton to stick to what she knows best -- policy. Some Clinton supporters expressed concern that Trump will try to hit her on issues like the email controversy and Benghazi. Here's a look at their advice for the Democratic nominee. Pat Fagan, 73, retired county parks and recreation director who lives in Clermont, Florida What does Clinton need to do at the first debate? ""She needs to continue being herself. I personally think how she handles herself with the public is the only way to go. Getting up there and then calling each other names and so forth -- I don't think that gets you anywhere."" What vulnerability do you think Clinton has at the debate? ""Personally I don't really know of any vulnerabilities she has. I think she's going to win the election by at least 10 points. I think she is going to rip him a new one in the debate."" Patti Fagan, 60, retired, lives in Clermont, Florida What advice do you have for Clinton heading into Monday's debate? ""I would like her to listen to her own heart and not to be afraid of Donald Trump because he's just a punk. I just wish her well and I know he's going to ... anger her, he's going to try to antagonize her. I've seen him when he debates others and he gets really low and I just hope she remains high."" What do you think will be Clinton's biggest vulnerability at the debate? ""Her biggest vulnerability is she overthinks. She's trying to say everything so perfectly and so correctly that I think some people take that as -- they don't trust her, they feel that it's forced. ... Don't overthink it because she's got it right and her instincts are right."" Mary Sharpe, 73, retired, lives in Lady Lake, Florida What does Clinton need to do to have a successful first debate? ""He's a pushover for baiting. I'd love to see her bait him into some crazy discussion. I think his tax returns, get him off on a tangent about his tax returns -- I think that'd be fun."" What do you think will be Clinton's biggest challenge at the debate? ""I think he is probably going to go for the Benghazi thing that they are trying to keep going. I don't think he will bring up the Clinton Foundation because now he's in trouble with his foundation. So I don't think he's going to go there."" Joe Caldwell, 80, Vietnam War veteran from Orlando, Florida What would you like to see Clinton do at the first debate? ""I would really like to see her (discuss) the health care issue, the (Americans with Disabilities Act), the veterans and social issues -- those types of issues because there are so many veterans out there that can't get the care that they need not because they don't know where to go but because it's not available to them and it's pitiful."" What do you think will be Clinton's her biggest vulnerability at the debate? ""I really hate to say this -- I do think that the most serious vulnerability is this thing that they keep bringing up that's history. Like the tapes, like the cell phone issues ... that's history. Let bygones be bygones. Start anew. It's a new day! She can handle it. Oh yes, she can handle it."" David Rucker, 70, retired from the Orange County public schools and lives in Orlando, Florida What do you want to see from Clinton at the debate? ""What I'd like for her to talk about is the police department. I think that needs to get into depth a little bit more to try to get an understanding between the two: the community and the police and sheriff's department. We need to have that camaraderie and we don't ... There are too many young black males getting killed for no reason at all. I realize that they're real nervous sometimes when confronting us but there still has to be a better way."" What do you think is Clinton's biggest weakness? ""I don't know if she's going to have a weakness ... I think she'll come out on top. I'm not worried at all. He's more of a reactionary guy and he'll try to follow Hillary and I think she'll eat him up."" Brittany Arroyo, 27, works at an engineering company and lives in Melbourne, Florida What is Clinton's biggest strength as she head into her first debate against Trump? ""Her biggest strength is her experience and intelligence. Ultimately she knows the most about every political issues especially compared to Donald Trump. Her level of experience just far outweighs almost any other political figure and even if she's not prepared for a question, she'll have plenty of knowledge on it."" What will Clinton's biggest challenge be at the debate? ""Unfortunately, I hate to say it, but as a woman I've seen it. She has to walk this fine line between being cute and likeable but also being tough and wise and intelligent and it's too hard -- you can never win. Even though we'll be watching and we won't care if she smiles, I know a lot of Republicans apparently do.""",0.04109589,0.02435312,0.02130898,0.01065449,0.065449011,0.266362253,0.0,2,-1,1
"President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has been blamed for human rights abuses in Egypt. | Getty Trump, Clinton blasted for meeting Egypt's strongman leader NEW YORK ? Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton's decisions to meet separately with Egypt's authoritarian president on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly have prompted a growing outcry on both the left and the right. On Monday, a small group of scholars and activists with a focus on Egypt, including some who identify as conservatives, released a letter they had written to both presidential candidates urging them not to meet with Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The authors pointed to the thousands of people killed and imprisoned under Sisi's harsh rule. Story Continued Below ""Since taking power via a military coup three years ago, President Sisi has overseen not only the complete reversal ofEgypt nascent democratic transition but also unprecedented human rights abuses,"" states the letter. ""It is not in our interest to embrace him but to use our influence to press for beneficial change in Egypt."" The letter, dated Friday, further states: ""Your meeting with Sisi at the UNGA will be taken in Egypt, and around the world, as an endorsement. To meet with him is a policy decision, which should await a later date after much study and assessment of U.S. policy toward Egypt. Therefore, we strongly urge you to readjust your schedule."" The signatories were: Michele Dunne of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; Robert Kagan of the Brookings Institution; Elliott Abrams of the Council on Foreign Relations; Reuel Gerecht of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies; Neil Hicks of Human Rights First; and Stephen McInerny of Project on Middle East Democracy. The letter writers are part of a non-partisan working group on Egypt that has been meeting since 2010, according to Kagan. Their criticism follows that of others including Human Right Watch's executive director Ken Roth, who wrote on Twitter: ""Why does Hillary again want to meet Sisi? He directed 817+ killed in 12 hours in Rabaa Sq"" ? a reference to a massacre in a Cairo square under Sisi's watch in 2013. Clinton met with Sisi on Monday evening; the Egyptian leader told her at the start of the meeting that he wished to talk to her ?about the path that we are taking in order to build up a new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law, that respects human rights and liberties. And as a matter of fact we are taking this path that is eventually leading up to this target,? according to a pool report of the event. Trump's team released an account of his meeting with Sisi that was striking in how much praise the Republican heaped on Egypt. Trump expressed to Sisi ""his strong support forEgypt war on terrorism, and how under a Trump administration, the United States of America will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that Egypt can count on in the days and years ahead."" Sisi, a retired general, came to prominence during the chaos of Egypt's 2011 Arab Spring revolution. He took power in 2013 after mass protests prompted the military to oust the elected government of Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Morsi. Trump has said that if elected president, he will work with Sisi to fight terrorism, describing him in a speech as someone who recognizes that ""this ideology of death that must be extinguished."" Clinton is critical of Sisi's predecessor, Morsi, who was arrested after his ouster and now faces a death sentence, in ""Hard Choices,"" her memoir about her years as secretary of state. But Clinton also has criticized Sisi, who she wrote ""appears to be following the classic mold of Middle Eastern strongmen."" Clinton's decision to meet with Sisi could stem from a desire to signal to Arab allies in the region that she will partner with rulers who impose stability, even if those rulers are autocrats.",0.021834061000000002,0.0,0.0,0.006550218000000001,0.050218341,0.31441048,0.010917031,2,-1,1
"Story highlights Donald Trump's supporters on Capitol Hill met for one last time before the election The Trump campaign sent out a debate prep survey to supporters on Thursday Washington (CNN) Donald Trump's supporters on Capitol Hill said Thursday they know the stakes are high for Monday night's debate and could set the tone for the sprint to Election Day. ""Donald Trump knows, the team knows that Monday night is going to be not necessarily make or break, but the momentum coming out of Monday night could be critical on both sides and Donald Trump knows that,"" said Rep. Chris Collins, a New York Republican, as he walked out of what could be the final meeting of Trump's congressional supporters. ""He's likely to bring up some Clinton issues. I think we're going to see some give and take there,"" Collins said. ""We all know Mr. Trump is a little quicker on his feet than Mrs. Clinton."" The group met for close to an hour at the Republican National Committee headquarters and discussed the Trump campaign's plan for battleground states as well, but the debate prep stood out in the meeting led by top Trump advisers. Collins, the first congressman to endorse Trump and an early leader of efforts to rally highly reluctant House Republicans to Trump's side, said that he will be flying to New York Monday to help the Trump campaign after the debate against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the media spin room.

"Washington  Hillary Clinton's moment of truth with the Obama coalition is fast approaching -- and she has work to do. The Democratic nominee's effort to win over voters who twice put Barack Obama in the White House -- and who represent her best chance of victory in November -- will reach new intensity this week in the run-up to her first crucial debate clash in seven days. Young, college-educated and minority voters formed the backbone of Obama's majority in 2008, helping to put once reliably Republican states like Virginia and North Carolina in the Democratic column and shore up the battered incumbent in swing states like Ohio and Florida in 2012. But recent polls indicate the race tightened dramatically in recent weeks, with GOP nominee Donald Trump on a roll. They suggest that Clinton is lagging behind Obama with younger voters and that she has failed to kindle the enthusiasm that drove them to the polls four and eight years ago. Questions are also mounting about the scale of likely turnout among black and Hispanic voters, who are expected to vote disproportionately for Clinton but could let her down if they do not show up in sufficient numbers in battleground states. Obama delivered a direct appeal to these voters over the weekend at the Congressional Black Caucus dinner where he made a passionate plea to his supporters to show up in November for Clinton. After appealing to forums of African-American and Hispanic leaders in recent days, Clinton will travel to crucial Pennsylvania on Monday to highlight the stakes for millennials. She previewed the likely thrust of her remarks last week in North Carolina in a more personal, emotive stump speech that she retooled while laid up with pneumonia. ""I am running for young people like so many of you here who dream of changing our world for the better,"" Clinton said. In that speech, the Democratic nominee also reached out to other sectors of the Obama coalition, including LGBT voters, African Americans and those who secured health care under the current president. JUST WATCHED Michelle Obama discusses birtherism Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Michelle Obama discusses birtherism 03:36 Clinton's running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, made a forceful push for millennial votes on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday, arguing that on the issues young people care about most, like climate change, women's health, college affordability, immigration reform and LGBT equality, there was only one possible choice in November. ""It's on our shoulders to make the case. But on at least five litmus test issues, the differences between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are vast,"" Kaine said. Clinton's need to improve her standing among young voters has become apparent in recent polling. A Quinnipiac University poll this month found that Clinton was backed by 31% of voters aged 18-34 while 29% favored Trump. But 44% of that group said they would vote for Libertarian Gary Johnson or Green Party leader Jill Stein. Other polls have also shown Clinton needing to improve her standing among the younger demographic. If she does not, it could harm her election chances because she is far more dependent on the youth vote than Trump, as the core Republican vote skews much older. A CNN/ORC poll last week had Clinton leading Trump by 54% to 29% among voters under the age of 45. But she's running behind Obama, who beat Romney 60% to 37% among the same group in 2012. While the former secretary of state has work to do to electrify the Democratic coalition, she could not have better allies. Most prominently, Obama himself, enjoying some of the best approval ratings of his presidency, is emerging as a passionate, adamant fighter for her cause. First lady Michelle Obama is also taking on a key role. Following her acclaimed speech at the Democratic National Convention this July, she told young voters in Virginia last week that their choice in November would decide whether they could afford a college education and keep their health care when they graduate. Even Clinton's bitter primary rival, Bernie Sanders, who became a rock star on college campuses and among young voters, is beginning to become more prominent as an advocate warning of the dangers of a Trump presidency. However, transferring support from one candidate to another is not just a simple matter of passing the baton. Obama's popularity among Democrats seems intimately attached to the President himself. His efforts to boost Democrats in mid-term elections in 2010 and 2014 had little effect, and his record on picking winners in off-year races is also patchy. It's left the impression that his is a uniquely ""Obama"" coalition that cannot be easily bequeathed to a successor. That may be one reason why Obama's appeal to black voters at the Congressional Black Caucus dinner on Saturday was so striking; he figuratively put himself on the ticket in November, urging African Americans to vote for him and his legacy. ""My name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,"" he said. ""After we have achieved historic turnout in 2008 and 2012, especially in the African-American community, I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election,"" Obama said in strikingly direct remarks. ""You want to give me a good sendoff? Go vote."" Obama's press secretary Josh Earnest told CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday that the President's comments were aimed at voters who were turned off by the negativity of the campaign that the ""stakes are too high"" to tune out. ""I think the impact is to send a clear message to the President's supporters across the country that even though his name isn't on the ballot, he feels passionately about the outcome of this race,"" Earnest said. JUST WATCHED Obama: We will educate Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Obama: We will educate Trump 01:29 The process of transferring Obama's African-American support to Clinton was given a significant lift by Trump's clumsy effort to lay to rest the ""birther"" controversy over his repeated false claims that the President may not have been born in the United States, and hence wasn't eligible for the country's highest office. Though the GOP nominee finally admitted on Friday that Obama was indeed born on American soil, he gave the controversy fresh life by claiming inaccurately that Clinton's 2008 campaign started the furor and that he ended it -- despite pushing the rumor years after Obama produced his birth certificate. ""If you would ask me to come up with one thing that would ruin Donald Trump's momentum over the last three weeks, I would say bringing up the birther thing,"" said Kevin Madden, a former top Romney strategist, on CNN's ""State of the Union Sunday. ""In many ways it has brought up new questions and in many ways it has put the spotlight again on Donald Trump in a very negative way."" For her part, Clinton, despite facing the historically daunting task of trying to win a third consecutive White House term for her party, is hugging Obama close. She paid a fulsome tribute to the President at the CBC dinner and vowed to work tirelessly for a strong African-American turnout in November. ""I want you to know I'm not taking your vote or anyone's vote for granted,"" she said. ""I need your help over the next 52 days to bring our campaign across the finish line together."" Trump's cause, however, has been boosted by a string of recent polls showing that the GOP nominee has all but neutralized Clinton's big convention bounce. And his campaign is suggesting that she will fail to pull off the kind of high turnout among key Democratic constituencies she needs to win in November. ""Bernie Sanders had an event yesterday in Ohio for Hillary Clinton. There were 150 people there,"" Trump campaign manager KellyAnne Conway said on CBS ""Face the Nation"" Sunday. ""That's like a second wedding where I come from. This is not a big movement for Hillary Clinton."" While the activity of last week and the coming one suggests that the Clinton campaign is concerned about its candidate's progress in reassembling the Obama coalition, the countdown to Election Day could serve to concentrate the minds of Democratic voters. Young voters are notoriously less likely to show up at the polls than older ones, but they confounded conventional wisdom when they repeatedly answered Obama's call in primary elections and general elections. In 2012, Republicans backing Romney were adamant that Obama would never recreate the kind of historic turnout, especially among black voters, that he had managed in 2008 when he leveraged the historic potential of the first African-American presidency. It was only on Election Day, when returns started trickling in from key counties in swing states from Florida to Ohio, that the Romney brain trust learned how wrong they were. But with Clinton's fate on the line, that coalition is now facing its final -- and most daunting -- test.",0.029795158,0.004655493,0.006517691,0.018621974,0.046554935,0.316573557,0.002793296,2,-1,1
"The FBI just released its second batch of documents Friday, including notes from their various interviews with State Department officials, such asHillary closest aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills. According to these newly-released documents, President Obama used a pseudonym when communicating by email with Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary of State. From Politico: In an April 5, 2016 interview with the FBI, Abedin was shown an email exchange between Clinton and Obama, but the longtime Clinton aide did not recognize the name of the sender. ?Once informed that thesender name is believed to be pseudonym used by the president, Abedin exclaimed: ?How is this not classified?'? the report says. ?Abedin then expressed her amazement at thepresident use of a pseudonym and asked if she could have a copy of the email.? The State Department has refused to make public that and other emails Clinton exchanged with Obama. Lawyers have cited the ?presidential communications privilege,? a variation of executive privilege, in order to withhold the messages under the Freedom of Information Act. The State Departmenthasn released the contents of the emails between the President and Secretary of State. The one that was shown to Abedin had the subject heading ?Re: Congratulations.? It was dated June 28, 2012. Politico speculates that it could have been in reference to the Supreme Court ruling on a particular part of the Obamacare law. Interestingly, President Obama had told reporters a little over a year ago that he had no idea the former Secretary of State used a private email server for official matters (even though he had been emailing her private address under a pseudonym). He said he learned about it ?the same time everybody else learned it through news reports.? What do you thinkObama pseudonym was?

"Another day, another real Trump controversy. While the media hyper-focuses on HillaryClinton ?pay-for-play? scandal (thatwasn actually a scandal, just crappy reporting from the Associated Press), a Washington Post report has found a major smoking gun regarding the Trump Foundation: Donald Trump spent more than a quarter-million dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved thebillionaire for-profit businesses, according to interviews and a review of legal documents. Totaling over $258,000 in Foundation money, Trump may have been involved in has violated laws against what is known as ?self-dealing? (something Trump is used to) which prohibits nonprofit leaders from using theircharity money to benefit themselves or their private businesses. So not only has the Trump Foundation been found to have illegally contributed to politicians, it has been found to be engaging in self-dealing. And people think the Clinton Foundation is immoral? Here are some of the examples: Florida, 2007: City of Palm Beach agrees to drop $120,000 in fines fromTrump Mar-a-Lago if he personally made a donation to aveteran charity. Instead of paying up personally, Trump signed a check from his foundation to the said charity, and the fines were waived. New York: Court papers show a a lawsuit against one ofTrump golf courses would be dropped if a donation was made to theplaintiff charity by Trump. Instead of paying up personally, Trump cut a check on behalf of the Foundation for $158,000. Washington D.C., 2013: Trump uses $5,000 from his Foundation to buy advertising in favor of his hotels (a personal business). 2014 and 2016: Trump used Foundation money, $10,000 the first time and $20,000 the second time, to buy portraits of himself. 2012: Trump spends $12,000 of Foundation money on a NFL helmet signed by Tim Tebo. According to the Post: In those cases, tax experts said, Trump was not allowed to simply keep these items and display them in a home or business. They had to be put to a charitable use. He did not use the paintings nor the helmet for charitable use, but rather personal use. Which is, as tax experts and the laws say, is illegal. So turns out the only crookedone in this race is Donald Trump, and the only fraudisn the Clinton foundation, but the Trump Foundation. Illegal contributions, illegal lawsuit payoffs, and personal gifts with otherpeople money (for non charitable use). Of course, the Clinton campaign hit on the issue, saying Trump is a ?fraud who believes the rulesdon apply to him, ? and that ?Clearly the Trump Foundation is as much a charitable organization as Trump University is an institute of higher education.? Ouch.Let see Fox News and the Trump camp try to spin this. Simply put, Trump needs to be forced to pay back all that he stole from donors and all that was used illegally. And ifdoesn, he should be prosecuted for being the fraud he is.

"When Prince Harry proposed to American commonerand Meghan Markle, it appeared as though fairytales do come true. A regular girl with a messy family dynamic and recluse father was flung into royalty and would soon become a princess. It seemed like a real Cinderella story until the fairytale came to a screeching halt after her secret came out, banning her from marrying the Prince. Now, Markle must face the royal family matriarch, the Queen of England, whodoesn seem too happy about whatshe been hiding. The picture of perfection and elegance that this couple has portrayed over the last few weeks as they flaunt their love for each other from the states to the Royal Palace, has now been shattered as it seems like it was a front for something else. The American actress does whatshe apparently pretty good at andthat pretending to be someone sheisn. As it turns out, Markle may not be able to wed Prince Harry in the Church of England, which officiates royal weddings. Prince Harry has planned to tie the knot with Markle in May, however, there could be some hiccups along the way before that can happen. The untraditional pair has done things differently than the royal tradition, starting with Harry marrying a divorced American actress. In 2011, Markle married Jewish film director, Trevor Engelson. They divorced about two years later in 2013. Having been married before is frowned upon in the royal family and will take some special permission for the pair to wed in the Spring of 2018, including from the Queen of England herself and a special license from the Archbishop of Canterbury. PEOPLE Magazine reports: For centuries, divorce was frowned upon by the Church of England and members of the British royal family were forbidden ? or at the very least, strongly discouraged ? from marrying someone who was divorced. The history-shaking controversy surroundingEdward abdication, as fans of The Crown will attest, has never been forgotten by Queen Elizabeth, who was just 10 when her uncle stepped aside ? paving the way for her own ascension to the throne. Edward married Simpson in 1937 in exile in France. But times have changed. In 2002, the General Synod ? the governing body of the Church of England ? voted to recognize ?that some marriages regrettably do fail.? They added, ?there are exceptional circumstances in which a divorced person may be married in church during the lifetime of a former spouse.? Any decision ?as to whether or not to solemnize such a marriage in church after divorce rests with the minister.? However, being a divorceeisn the only hurtle Markle is facing in marrying her prince. Religion plays a part as well and since she seems to assume the faith of whoevershe with,she going to have to state what she believes on her own.It unknown what her religion is or if she has one since she married her first husband in a Jewish ceremony but attended a private Catholic school growing up. Ifshe in fact Catholic, this could be a problem in marrying Harry in the Church of England. PEOPLE Magazine explains: In order to remain in the line of succession, members of the royal family cannot be Catholic. The vast majority are members of the Church of England, with the Queen serving as the head of the church. And until 2013, laws forbade members of the family from marrying someone who is Catholic. It was a restriction couples could work around: PeterPhillips wife, Autumn, converted from Catholicism before their May 2008 wedding. If shehadn, Phillips ? theQueen eldest grandchild, who is 13th in line to the throne ? would have lost his place in the line of succession. However, in 2013, Britain modernized their laws. Now, those in the immediate line of succession can marry anyone they like, regardless of religion (provided they have permission from the monarch ifthey one of the first six in line to the throne).

Under the previous primogeniture rule, any boy would take priority over an older sister.

"DonaldTrump lies are catching up to him one by one, and the latest person to call him out is Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and biographer David Cay Johnston. Some of you may not know who Johnston is, but he is the author behind The Making of Donald Trump ? so he knows quite a bit about who the erratic business mogul is andisn. In a newly released video, Johnston claims that there is absolutely no proof that Trump is the billionaire he says he is ? adding another layer of deceit and fraud toTrump already horrendous track record. The clip was published by Business Insider, where Johnston goes throughTrump bragging claims and compares them to the actual data on the businessmogul court records and bank filings. For example, Johnston says that last year, Trump said his net worth was $8.7 billion, $10 billion, $11 billion and higher, ?even though there was nothing going on in the economy that would suggest that kind of gyrations of net worth.? The truth is, Trump is lying though his teeth. Johnston said: ?The fact of the matter is that Donald Trump just makes it up.? Johnston also brought up a court testimony where Trump said he uses his gut feelingsand ?emotional state? to determine his net worth. Johnston joked about how nutsit was, and imitatedTrump strategy: ?By the way,I having a great day today. I think my net worth must be at least a billion dollars.? Johnston has been trying to get America to believe thatTrump billionaire status was fake since 1990. During that time, a net worth statement byTrump bankers said that the GOPnominee net worth was actually negative $295 million. Johnston is still standing by the claim that Trumpisn as successful as he seems, and continues to insist that although Trump is well off, there is ?no evidence that he is a billionaire.?

"Donald Trump on Friday pulled off his latest media stunt, scoring more than 20 minutes of free live TV time to tout the endorsement of more than a dozen veterans and to talk up his new hotel in Washington after he and his campaign had promised he would address his longstanding, controversial ""birther"" position. Then, he made a 67-word statement stating that he now believes President Barack Obama was born in the US, and quickly abandoned the podium -- leaving reporters bellowing questions into the ether. None of us were surprised. After all, Friday's circus was nothing short of standard operating procedure for the real estate mogul and his media-bashing campaign -- and just the latest example of how Trump fueled his political rise through his unparalleled mastery of the media. But this time, there weren't just a few shouted questions from reporters. Instead, Trump stepped away from the mic amid a cacophony of cheering supporters -- more than 100 of whom separated Trump from the press -- and reporters, some standing on chairs, shouting dozens of questions at the top of our lungs. ""When did you change your mind about Obama being born in the US?"" I shouted. ""What took you so long to make this decision?"" shouted another reporter. ""Why won't you answer our questions?"" And then, he's gone. Trump had just changed a signature position he's held for years with a few dozen words and no explanation of why he had suddenly changed his mind. And he also notched 51 days since his last news conference. The moment was emblematic of Trump's treatment of the press throughout the campaign -- particularly in the last 24 hours. Reporters covering this campaign -- as I have for the last 15 months -- have long grown used to Trump lobbing insults our way, shouts of ""scum,"" ""dishonest"" and ""disgusting"" reverberating as thousands of his supporters, many of them snickering at the spectacle, turn toward the press pen, booing. Some of us have even come to expect a call from the would-be-president every so often to hear the candidate gripe about a particular article and shame us as ""dishonest."" Oh, just another lovely encounter with an angry @realDonaldTrump supporter after a rally by the media pen: pic.twitter.com/tZv5bQBDeE ? Jeremy Diamond (@JDiamond1) August 11, 2016 But on Thursday night, Trump took his mistreatment of the press to new lows, taking the stage at a rally in New Hampshire moments before the traveling press corps' plane touched down in the state, and proceeding to mock us. ""I have really good news for you. I just heard that the press is stuck on their airplane. They can't get there. I love it,"" Trump said, to his supporters' glee. We arrived for the last three minutes of his speech -- a circumstance caused by Trump's refusal to travel on the same plane as reporters covering his campaign, defying decades of precedent in the coverage of Democratic and Republican nominees. The event on Friday was his coup-de-grace. Having promised a ""major statement,"" via Twitter, Trump talked up his hotel -- ""under budget and ahead of schedule"" -- and invited a parade of military veterans to come to the podium and tell the world why they were supporting Trump's presidential bid. The event was no longer about a Republican presidential nominee reversing his position on an issue supported by a fringe slice of America. It was about brave military men embracing this controversial figure, flaws and all. I am now going to the brand new Trump International, Hotel D.C. for a major statement. ? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2016 All the while, the cameras continued to roll, the remarks carried live on cable news in anticipation that Trump would clarify his position on birtherism as he had promised that morning. It's the kind of free, unfiltered media coverage that every politician dreams of, but few will ever grasp. Finally, after 28 minutes, Trump lifted the suspense and got to the point. He falsely claimed that his opponent Hillary Clinton ""started the birther controversy"" in 2008 and stated, matter-of-factly, that ""President Barack Obama was born in the United States"" -- something Obama proved beyond a shadow of a doubt in 2011 when he released his long-form birth certificate. He spent more time talking about his hotel than explaining how he was changing his position on the issue that skyrocketed him to national political prominence and earned him his earliest notes of support from the far-right. This is the Trump traveling press corps' view of tonight's NH rally as he takes the stage and brags we're not there pic.twitter.com/xFuOG3RObz ? Noah Gray (@NoahGrayCNN) September 16, 2016 Trump laid his media trap the night before when his campaign put out a statement hours after a Washington Post interview published in which Trump declined to disavow his birther views. The interview took place a day earlier, but the campaign waited another day, until 12 hours before the event in Washington, to blast out a statement. It remains to be seen whether Trump's move helped him. CNN and Fox News cut away at points in the presentation. Networks spent the day talking about Trump's history as a birther. The Trump campaign had also previously billed a March campaign event as a possible news conference, only for the candidate to not take any questions. The event, which had been scheduled earlier, came just days after his campaign manager was accused of grabbing a reporter. Before Friday, the campaign's most recent deception came Wednesday when campaign advisers told reporters that Trump would not be releasing results of his latest medical exam on the ""Dr. Oz"" program. And then Trump did just that, with a reality show-style surprise As we filed into the event hall for his rally Friday night, we were still nowhere closer to understanding why Trump had suddenly flip-flopped on birtherism. The campaign had ignored all our requests for comment. We hadn't had an opportunity to prod Trump on the when and why of his sudden change of heart, especially when he had declined to disavow the position just days earlier.

"Liberals in the media and the political arena thought that HillaryClinton victory was in the bag. The rest of the campaign was a mere formality in order for her to make the White House her residence once again. Hercampaign plan was to lay low, out of the spotlight, make little to no contact with the press, and just let Donald Trump do all the talking and hopefully keep his foot in his mouth to draw all the media attention. But now that the post-DNC honeymoon is over, they have to come back to reality and see that the electionisn over, and that they had grossly underestimated Donald Trump and his campaign.

"While Donald Trump Jr., Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization, compares refugees to poisoned skittles, the CEOs, Presidents and other executives of 51 companies are coming together to pledge hundreds of millions of dollars to aid refugees all across the world, the White House has announced. Coming together to show solidarity and compassion while world leaders meet for the U.N. General Assembly session, the companies ? which include Matercard, Facebook, Twitter, Johnson & Johnson, and yogurt maker Chobani ? will use the money to promote, sustain and continue education, employment and financial services all across the world, and alleviate suffering to over 6 million refugees: Today, 51 U.S. companies ? which represent more than 2.5 million employees, more than $775 billion in annual revenue, and more than $3.2 trillion in market capitalization ? have stepped up and are standing with the Administration to demonstrate that private sector innovation and resources can make a difference and catalyze real solutions. Together, they have committed to investing, donating, and raising more than $650 million. The hefty pledge is just part of the WhiteHouse goal of $3 billion in humanitarian aid, and the announcement was made just as President Obama hosted a refugee summit with the leaders of Jordan, Mexico, Sweden, Germany, Canada and Ethiopia, countries that have taken in thousands of refugees from Syria and other war-torn states. While meeting with the company CEOs and George Clooney, President Obama thanked them for their ?extraordinary gesture of compassion,? saying: ?I want to emphasize that from their perspective thisisn charity.

"New York  BREAKING NEWS: Barack Obama vetoed Friday a bill that would allow family members of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia. The White House claimed it could expose US diplomats and servicemen to litigation in other countries. Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress say they'll override Obama's veto next week. Obama has now issued 12 vetoes. If successful, Congress' override will be the first of Obama's presidency. ORIGINAL STORY: A clash between the White House and Congress appears likely at the end of this week as President Barack Obama prepares to reject a measure allowing victims' families and survivors of the September 11 attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia. Support for the ""Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act"" ran high among lawmakers, who overwhelmingly passed the bill after pressure from victims' groups. The bill passed with enough support to indicate lawmakers could override the President's expected veto. But in recent days some of the measure's supporters have expressed misgivings about the legislation, prompting a new effort by the administration to lobby against the bill. The White House hasn't specified when Obama will officially veto the measure, which he's vowed to reject claiming it could open US diplomats and service-members to lawsuits. The 10-day window for the President to submit his rejection closes on Friday, and the White House is hoping to keep its options open by waiting until nearer the deadline. Administration officials had been eying a Friday afternoon veto, which would have come after Congress was expected to adjourn until November's election contests. But prolonged negotiations over a government funding bill and a package to combat Zika virus have delayed the recess, meaning lawmakers are still likely to be in Washington next week to cast an override vote. A person familiar with the administration's thinking said that Friday afternoon still appeared the most likely period for the veto to come down. That would maximize time for White House officials to press members of Congress to reconsider support for the measure. ""White House officials and other senior officials on the president's national security team have engaged members of Congress and their staffs in both parties in both houses,"" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters in New York on Tuesday. He wouldn't disclose when Obama planned to veto the bill. ""As soon as the President has put pen to paper, we'll be sure and let all of you know,"" Earnest said. The Republican leaders of the Senate and House have both said in recent says that an override is expected to go through, despite new qualms about the bill. If successful it would be the first veto override of Obama's presidency. ""Our assumption is that the veto will be overridden,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Tuesday. House Speaker Paul Ryan followed suit Wednesday, saying ""I do think the votes are there for the override."" But the Wisconsin Republican also voiced his own doubts about the legislation, saying the implications for lawsuits against Americans worried him. ""I worry about legal matters,"" Ryan said. ""I worry about trial lawyers trying to get rich off of this. And I do worry about the precedence. At the same time, these victims do need to have their day in court."" He was one of several prominent lawmakers who have expressed buyers' remorse for the proposed law. A pair of Republican senators, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have pushed for changes to make it more difficult for the families to pursue lawsuits but could also make it harder for the US to be sued for alleged wrongdoing. Opponents of the bill gained support Wednesday from the European Union, which issued its opposition in the form of a ""demarche"" statement to the US Department of State. ""The European Union is of the view that the possible adoption and implementation of the JASTA would be in conflict with fundamental principles of international law and in particular the principle of State sovereign immunity,"" the EU statement read. ""The European Union considers that the adoption of the bill and its subsequent implementation might also have unwanted consequences as other States may seek to adopt similar legislation, leading to a further weakening of the principles of State sovereignty immunity.""

" Early numbers from Iowa and North Carolina, where voters are already casting absentee ballots, look promising for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. And Democrats have also improved their position on the voter rolls in Colorado and Florida, outpacing Republicans in the past month, according to a CNN analysis of newly released statistics. Voters in a handful of states have already started to request, receive, and cast absentee ballots, and some states publicly disclose how many Republicans and Democrats have requested ballots. Of course, there is no guarantee that all voters will stay loyal to their party when they cast their ballot, and no results from any states will be announced until polls close on Election Day, November 8. In North Carolina, more than 56,000 people have requested absentee ballots: 36% of them were Democrats and 35% were Republicans. Another 28% were independents, according to the North Carolina State Board of Elections. Over 3,600 ballots already cast in North Carolina More than 3,600 people in North Carolina have apparently they've decided that they've seen enough of the 2016 campaign and already cast their ballots. It's a tiny fraction of voters -- more than 4.5 million people participated in the Tar Heel State in the 2012 presidential election. Democrats have returned 1,508 ballots, or 41%; Republicans 1,227 ballots, or 34%; and Independents 909 ballots, or 29%, as of Wednesday, according to the North Carolina state Board of Elections. In Iowa, more than 91,000 voters have asked for absentee ballots, according to the secretary of state's office. In all, 57% of those voters are registered Democrats, 22% are independents and 21% are Republicans. These are decent numbers for Clinton, but there is a significant drop-off from 2012. At this point, four years ago, more than 105,000 Democrats had requested absentee ballots. So far this year, only 51,663 Democrats have asked for ballots. The number for Republicans was almost the same both years. Democrats add voters in Florida, Colorado Democrats have seen their position improve in some key states when it comes to voter registration. Shifts in registration don't necessarily indicate which party is attracting new voters, because people switch parties, move to new states, and are removed from the rolls when they die. But these statistics contextualize the political landscape and are helpful data points in the big picture of electoral analysis. Democrats padded their existing registration edge in Florida, by adding almost 16,000 more voters to the rolls in the past month than Republicans did, according to the Florida Department of State. Their overall advantage in the state is about 274,000. It might seem like a nearly insurmountable a lead, but it isn't. President Barack Obama had an even larger advantage in 2012, but he only carried the Sunshine State that year by about 74,000 votes. Out west, in Colorado, Democrats have nearly erased what was once a formidable Republican registration advantage. They outpaced Republicans by about 9,000 voters in the past month, according to new data from the Colorado Secretary of State. That means the Republican registration advantage in Colorado is only about 2,600 right now. It was nearly 12,000 in August, and it was three times that size in November 2012, when Obama carried the state. Registration numbers have been stable in several other key swing states. That's good news for Democrats in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Nevada, where they have the advantage. And that's good news for the GOP in New Hampshire and Iowa, where there are more Republicans on the rolls. Currently, Democrats lead Republicans by about 919,000 registered voters in Pennsylvania, about 644,000 in North Carolina and about 71,000 in Nevada. Republicans lead Democrats by about 34,000 registered voters in Iowa and about 24,000 in New Hampshire. The voter rolls were very stable in both states in the past month. For example, the GOP edge in Iowa grew by only 175 votes since August.",0.037199125,0.004376368,0.0,0.006564551,0.061269147,0.19693654300000002,0.0,1,-1,1

The Trump campaign released a statement last night saying their candidate believed Barack Obama was born in the United States, but theydidn believe it. This morning the campaign announced that Trump will make a statement about the birther issue and they all rushed to his new DC hotel for the press conference. But Trumpdidn come out right away. First the press had to listen to (and in some cases televise) a series of Medal of Honor winners praising the GOP candidate. And when they were all done Trump came out and said: ?Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.? With that it was over.

"Donald Trump is misleading people by citing unscientific, unrepresentative Internet polls that portray him as the ""winner"" of Monday's debate. ""We won every poll. Virtually every poll,"" he told supporters Tuesday afternoon, challenging the media consensus that Hillary Clinton prevailed. Trump also promoted eleven of these so-called polls in a tweet, calling his wins in them ""such a great honor."" But the things Trump called ""debate polls"" -- implying rigorous, scientific polling -- were informal web site surveys that invited anyone to respond. Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson told CNNMoney that the surveys are like ""junk food."" Meaningful national polls seek a diverse sample of respondents. The goal is to accurately represent the views of the country by accounting for differences in age, gender, party affiliations and other factors. That's not possible when anonymous web users fill out online surveys. People choose whether to participate, and they can vote multiple times, further warping the results. The only thing these surveys can measure, to a limited degree, is enthusiasm -- and some Trump supporters are definitely enthusiastic. But political scientists and researchers say it is a mistake to read much more than that into unscientific survey results. Early Tuesday morning, former Obama strategist David Plouffe tweeted that the online surveys cited by Trump are simply ""bogus."" Trump's proclivity for unscientific surveys was on display throughout the primary season. He frequently claimed that he ""won"" debates based on self-selecting polls conducted by web sites like The Drudge Report. Several respected news outlets -- Time, CNBC and Fortune to name three -- posted the surveys after Monday's debate, lending the unreliable practice an air of credibility. While sites like Time may value giving visitors a way to opine about the debate, Trump's embrace of the results ends up embarrassing both himself and the news outlet involved. ""These snap polls are just a way to feed the beast until the next batch of appropriately-conducted polls can come out to tell us if voters actually moved. It's like eating a junk food snack between meals,"" Anderson said. Trump's tweet also cited surveys from obscure web sites like ""PolitOpinion."" In one case on Tuesday, Trump even cited a poll that did not exist. ""I won CBS,"" he said on ""Fox & Friends."" CBS correspondent Major Garrett took to Twitter to clarify: ""We did not conduct a post-debate poll."" CBS did conduct a focus group of undecided voters, and Clinton came out ahead. Trump said on Fox that the survey results ""mean a lot"" to him, noting that hundreds of thousands of votes were cast on some of the web sites. That's true, but since people can vote multiple times -- and, with the right software, perhaps even more than that -- it isn't necessarily meaningful. Nevertheless, the surveys allow Trump and his aides to rail against media elite reactions to the debate and argue that voters are outsmarting pundits. And that's exactly what the campaign did on Tuesday. ""Trump won"" was the campaign's dominant social media message, citing the surveys as proof. Some political reporters called out the tactic. ?""Trump's aggressive promotion of online (easily manipulated, non-scientific) polls saying he 'won' is a calculated effort to create a reality,"" Emily Flitter, who covers the Trump campaign for Reuters, tweeted. But the co-hosts of ""Fox & Friends,"" who are reliable cheerleaders for Trump, went along with Trump's talking point. Other Fox hosts also picked up on it, even though the network has its own well-regarded polling unit. Fox morning news anchor Martha MacCallum said debate watchers are ""leaning toward Donald Trump, and by pretty large margins in most of these viewer polls."" She called CNN's poll the ""outlier,"" showing Clinton as the clear winner among debate watchers. In fact, CNN/ORC's poll was one of the few polls conducted by professional researchers immediately following the debate. ""Clinton was deemed the winner of Monday night's debate by 62% of voters who tuned in to watch, while just 27% said they thought Trump had the better night,"" CNN polling director Jennifer Agiesta wrote, based on the findings of interviews with 521 registered voters. ""Although the survey suggested debate watchers were more apt to describe themselves as Democrats than the overall pool of voters, even independents who watched deemed Clinton the winner."" Related: Post-debate poll: Hillary Clinton takes round one Conflating CNN's scientific poll with unscientific surveys, as both Trump and MacCallum did, is highly misleading. Some web sites, hungry for traffic, glommed on to the Trump-invented controversy. ""Majority of snap polls show Trump won debate by a landslide despite CNN's overwhelming victory for Hillary in biggest official survey,"" The Daily Mail web site said. Unhappy with the results of CNN's scientific poll, Trump criticized the network on Twitter, on Fox and at a campaign event. ""We won virtually every poll. Except for CNN. And nobody watches CNN,"" he said. About 10 million people watched the debate on CNN on Monday night. Overall, more than 80 million people tuned in on television, and millions more live-streamed the debate on the Internet.",0.023564065,0.001472754,0.001472754,0.005891016,0.054491899999999996,0.24153166399999998,0.0,2,-1,1
"Ed Meese joined a slew of prominent Republicans in bashing Donald Trump earlier this year in National Review. | Getty Sources: Former Trump critic Ed Meese joins transition team Former Attorney General Ed Meese, a long-time aide to Ronald Reagan and a one-time critic of Donald Trump's candidacy for president, has joined the Republican nominee's transition team, according to two people briefed on the hire. Meese's decision to join the transition team might raise eyebrows among Trump's die-hard supporters. Meese joined a slew of prominent Republicans in bashing Trump earlier this year in National Review, the conservative magazine that has led the charge against the Manhattan businessman. Story Continued Below Meese wrote in January that Trump's ""broadsides"" against fellow GOP candidates had served ""to divide and discourage potential Republican-party supporters."" ""Questionable assertions that an opponent is not eligible to run, or that another cannot be elected, or that still another lacks enthusiasm or energy, are a poor substitute for addressing the real issues that should be the basis for a positive campaign: restoring economic growth, strengthening national security, eliminating cronyism and corruption, and improving the lives of all Americans,"" he added. But with Trump's nomination cemented and the polls tightening, Meese and other Trump critics like Ted Cruz are beginning to come around. Two sources said Meese is heading a Trump transition group focused on the Executive Office of the President, which includes the Office of Management and Budget. Meese declined to comment, and the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Meese was an aide to Reagan during his time as governor of California. He led Reagan's presidential transition team in 1980 and later served as Reagan's attorney general before resigning in July 1988 following a special prosecutor's inquiry involving his ties to an Army contractor and an Iraqi pipeline project. He is a fellow at the Heritage Foundation. Trump's transition team, which is led by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, is rapidly expanding, with one source telling POLITICO that nearly 100 people are now involved in the effort. And even as some Republicans refuse to take part, Christie and his staff have managed to recruit people with both establishment and conservative credentials, including former Heritage Foundation President Ed Feulner and Eric Ueland, the Senate Budget Committee's Republican staff director. In addition to Meese and Feulner, sources told POLITICO that Paul Winfree, another Heritage Foundation official, is also working on the Trump transition.

"Gunfire and racially charged rioting have broken out again, this time in Charlotte, offering Donald Trump another chance to unabashedly sell himself as the ?law and order? candidate, to side with police over African-American protesters and to rally his overwhelmingly white base. But Trumphasn quite done that. Story Continued Below Instead, the Republican presidential nominee delivered a more muted response as he called into Fox News Thursday morning, saying ?there's a lack of spirit between the white and the black.? A day earlier, while campaigning in a black neighborhood in Cleveland, Trump defended an unarmed black man who was shot recently ? and questioned the actions of the police officer who shot him. After more than a year of running one of the most racially and ethnically divisive campaigns in decades, Trump has begun to zig and zag on issues of race in theelection final stretch. Appearing with black supporters and in black neighborhoods multiple times this month, Trump has sought to wash away the charges of racism that white nationalists have cheered. Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, has made casting Trump as outside-the-mainstream ? she hammered Trump on The Steve Harvey Show for ?bullying and bigotry? this week ? one of the cornerstones of her campaign.Trump advisers and the candidate himself insist his concerted black outreach is a genuine effort to chip away at Democrats? overwhelmingly margin among black voters, a group with whom he is polling in the low single digits. But Democrats, and even some skeptical Republicans, see his new tone more as an effort to make himself palatable to uneasy white voters who might otherwise be turned off by his past rhetoric. ?When he asks black voters, ?What have you got to lose, itcan get any worse,?he really just cynically talking to white voters,? said Rob Stutzman, a veteran Republican strategist and Trump critic. NAACP President Cornell William Brooks said, ?I can't discern the intentions of Mr. Trump on this issue, but here's what we can say: Policy without particulars on the eve of the election insults the intelligence and sensitivities of any group.? Trump spoke most at length about the unfolding violence in Charlotte on Thursday at an energy conference in Pittsburgh, describing a ?very wounded country? and national leadership vacuum that he would fill. ?There is no right to engage in violent disruption,? Trump said, as Charlotte residents have taken to the streets in violent protest of the fatal shooting of a black man there. Police have fired back tear gas in intense clashes. He pitched his ?law and order? approach as beneficial to black communities. ?The people who will suffer most are law abiding African-American residents,? Trump said. That line was in his prepared remarks distributed by his campaign. But moments later, he ad-libbed a white stereotype of black communities. ?And ifyou not aware,? Trump said, deviating from his teleprompter. ?Drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night.? These days, Trump regularly tells mostly white audiences about the travesty of black neighborhoods, comparing them to war-torn places like Afghanistan. In rural North Carolina on Tuesday, Trump said that African-American communities are ?absolutely in the worst shape thatthey ever been in before, ever, ever, ever.? On Wednesday, not long after his appearance with a Cleveland church where Trump questioned the police officer in Oklahoma who shot an unarmed black man, Terence Crutcher, Trump embraced a broad expansion ?stop-and-frisk,? a controversial policing policy. By Thursday, Trump said hewasn backing a national policy ? saying he was only referring to Chicago, despite making his comment in Cleveland. ""We've seen an expression of empathy for the loss of Mr. Crutcher's life, followed by a call for the nationalization and expansion of stop-and-frisk, preceded by a call for law and order without specifying what that means,? Brooks said. ?His platform suffers from a multiple personality disorder. It's not consistent.? Still, Trump has clearly made some efforts. In Pittsburgh, Trump preached empathy. ?We all have to walk a mile in someoneelse shoes,? he said. It was an echo of none other thanClinton remarks after the shooting of police officers in Dallas in July. ?I will call for white people like myself to put ourselves in the shoes of those African-American families,? Clinton said on CNN then. With all his stop-and-start black outreach, Trump appears to be honing the greatest of political skills: letting different audiences hear the same words and imbue them with different meaning. ?It just seems that there's a lack of spirit between the white and the black. I mean, it's a terrible thing that we're witnessing. You're seeing it, I'm seeing it. And you look at what went on last night in Charlotte, a great place, and you just see it,? as he said Fox News on Thursday. ?There's a ? there's somewhat ? and I see it even going out. There's such a lack of ? there's a lack of spirit. There's a lack of something. Something's going on that's bad. And what's going on between police and others is getting worse.? The racistcharge has deeply irkedTrump friends and allies. Bruce LeVell, the executive director of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump who traveled with him in Ohio this week, expressed frustration with the negative labels affixed to Trump. ?It?s just unfair, unfortunately, whathe had to endure,? LeVell said. ?Idon believehe changed his tone and tenor. Donald Trump has been clear since day onehe for all Americans.? Trump has drawn historically low support levels in polling among African-American voters, including some swing-state surveys over the summer in Ohio and Pennsylvania that showed him with 0 percent. He has climbed from such lows, claiming his numbers are trending upward ?like a rocket ship? but he remains mired in single digits in most surveys. His approval among Latinos is not much better. In a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News, showed Trump with 17 percent support among likely Hispanic voters ? 10 points below what Mitt Romney received four years ago. Nearly 80 percent had negative feelings about Trump. Whit Ayres, a GOP pollster who has said Republicans must do better among minority groups to compete in national elections, said hecouldn be sure whoTrump spate of black outreach was truly targeting. ?Your question assumes a level of calculation that I am not sure is warranted,? Ayres said. Madeline Conway contributed to this report.",0.038895859,0.007528231,0.003764115,0.010037641,0.071518193,0.32120451699999997,0.006273526,2,-1,1

General Assembly in New York, the White House said Sunday. The meeting, set to occur Wednesday, ?will afford them an opportunity to discuss the strong ties between the United States and Israel, as recently underscored by the finalization of a new 10-year Memorandum of Understanding with Israel, the single largest pledge of military assistance in U.S. history,? White House Press Secretary Joshua Earnest said. ?The meeting also will be an opportunity to discuss the need for genuine advancement of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the face of deeply troubling trends on the ground.? Story Continued Below Earnest said the two leaders are likelyto discuss the U.S.-led nuclear deal with Iran, as well as ?other regional security issues.? Last week, Israel and the United States inked a $38 billion, 10-year aid package that is the largest such agreement in U.S. history. But the deal came with conditions thatNetanyahu political rivals have attacked as unacceptable concessions, including a promise not to ask Congress for additional funding and the phasing out of provisions that allowed Israel to spend a portion of U.S. aid money on its own defense industry. Ehud Barak, a former Israeli prime minister and a former defense minister under Netanyahu, blasted the arrangement in a Washington Post op-ed as ?far less than what could have been obtained before the prime minister chose to blatantly interfere with U.S. politics."" Barak has also gone after Netanyahu in more than an half-dozen scathing interviews in Israel. Netanyahu on Sunday defended the deal at the start of his weekly cabinet meeting, thanking Obama and the U.S. Congress and pushing back against Barak and other unnamed critics. ?I hear all kinds of background noise and disinformation about the agreement,? Netanyahu said. ?I would like to make it clear: We were never offered more. We were not offered more money, not even one dollar, and we were never offered special technologies. These are distortions and fabrications of interested parties; either they do not have the facts or they are distorting the facts, and they are, of course, showing ingratitude, and in my view this is the saddest thing of all, ingratitude to our greatest and best friend, the United States.?Netanyahu relationship with Obama has been strained through thepresident two terms in office ? tensions that exploded into public view last year, when he accepted an invitation from then House Speaker John Boehner to address a joint meeting of Congress without first informing the White House.

Enough Democrats stood by the president, however, and Republicansweren able to stop it from going into effect in January. The two leaders have sought to mend fences, but tensions have occasionally flared. In March 2016, Netanyahu abruptly canceled a planned meeting with Obama, a move the White House criticized as bad manners. More recently, the Obama administration chastised Netanyahu for saying that Palestinians favored ?ethnic cleansing,? with the State Department described as ?inappropriate and unhelpful.? The meeting comes as the Obama administration reportedly weighs whether to outline its view of what a two-state solution should look like, a move that would embarrass Netanyahu and likely lead to a new explosion of tensions just as the president wraps up his tenure. Obama will also have a ?pull-aside? meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Monday, Earnest said. ?The two leaders will discuss steps to deepen the U.S.-China relationship, while addressing issues of bilateral and regional concern, including North Korea's provocations,? he said.",0.027139875,0.0,0.004175365,0.006263048,0.043841335999999995,0.334029228,0.004175365,2,-1,1
"Less than a day after protests over the police killing of an African-American man turned violent in North Carolina, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump placed some of the blame for the turmoil on the impact of drugs. Interested in Donald Trump? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest ""If you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night,"" said Trump in a speech to the Shale Insight 2016 Conference in Pittsburgh today. On Wednesday night, Charlotte experienced its second night of protests after the death of Keith Lamont Scott on Tuesday afternoon. Officers in riot gear confronted demonstrators in a downtown commercial area and employed tear gas to control crowds. One person is in critical condition after suffering an apparent gunshot wound. The Republican nominee condemned the violence, calling for unity. ""Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world's leader. How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities? We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate, but there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others."" He continued to praise law enforcement officers, citing the challenges they face and calling for better training. ""It's tough being a police officer,"" Trump said. ""Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure that they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public and that any wrongdoing is always ? and it will be by them ? vigorously addressed."" But aside from that one reference, amid his heavy-handed praise for law enforcement and condemnation of protesters, Trump never acknowledged any pattern of violence against African-Americans at the hands of police, which is precisely why so many protesters say they have taken to the streets. They cite the shooting deaths of dozens of other black Americans by police as cause to protest a system they say is dangerous and discriminatory and fails to prosecute far too many officers who kill African-Americans, in many instances unarmed. Trump in recent days has appealed to black Americans, asking them what they have to lose by voting for him, even as he paints an exceptionally grim portrait of black poverty and crime. During a rally earlier this week in North Carolina, Trump said, ""We're going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever, ever, ever,"" Many African-Americans have bristled at that broad assertion. While many inner cities are plagued by crime and poverty, according to census data from 2015, 52.9 percent of black Americans age 25 or older hold some sort of college degree. A Pew report released in December shows that black adults experienced the largest income increase from 1971 to 2015 and were the only racial group to see a decrease in the percentage of low-income earners. And according to the Census Bureau, almost 73 percent of black Americans do not live in poverty. Trump, in an effort to reach out to the black community, visited Cleveland earlier this week, appearing at a black church. And during a town hall on the Fox News Channel Wednesday night, he was asked about the threat of violence. ""I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to,"" said Trump. ""We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically."" But this morning in an interview on ""Fox & Friends"" he stepped back from the statement, claiming he was referring to a strategy only for Chicago. In Pittsburgh, Trump delineated a difference between what he called the ""violent disruptor"" and the rest of the black community. He said it was the country""s job ""to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and to get their children great educations.""",0.025157232999999998,0.004192872,0.004192872,0.008385744,0.064989518,0.324947589,0.002096436,2,-1,1

"Raleigh, North Carolina  As soon as the first debate of the 2016 presidential election was over, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were quick to claim victory. But by the next morning, one of them had become far less cheerful. Just hours after Clinton and Trump clashed on stage at Hofstra University in one of the most highly anticipated political events in modern history, the two presidential nominees took markedly different tones as they reflected on the previous night's debate. Clinton and her aides showed all of the outward signs of a team riding high. The Democratic nominee boarded her plane at Westchester County Airport to applause and cheers from her staff. Before taking off to Raleigh, North Carolina, for a campaign rally, a smiling candidate walked to the back of the plane to gloat to reporters about a ""great, great"" evening ""One of my favorite baseball players growing up, Ernie Banks, used to get so excited about going to play that he would say, 'Lets play two,'"" Clinton said. ""So I am looking forward to the next debate and the one after that."" And taking a dig at Trump's complaint after the debate that he was given a ""defective"" microphone, Clinton quipped: ""Anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night."" And in fact, the Republican nominee did not appear to be having a good morning. Calling into Fox News' ""Fox & Friends"" early Tuesday, Trump rattled off more than one complaint about the debate. His first target was NBC News' Lester Holt, the moderator of Monday night's debate. Just hours before, Trump had praised Holt in the spin room to CNN, saying the newscaster had done a ""great job"" and was ""very fair."" Those compliments were long gone. ""I had some hostile questions,"" Trump said on Fox News. ""He didn't ask her about the emails at all. He didn't ask her about her scandals. He didn't ask her about the Benghazi deal that she destroyed. He didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. There's no question about it."" Trump was still irritated -- and even conspiratorial -- about his microphone. ""My microphone was terrible,"" Trump complained. ""I wonder: was it set up that way on purpose?"" To top things off, Trump unloaded on former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who has alleged that the businessman's disparaging treatment of her had led to eating disorders and depression. With no apparent consideration for the political recklessness of his crude comments, Trump once again went after Machado's physical appearance, bringing her up on his own. ""That person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst. The absolute worst,"" Trump said. ""She gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem. We had a real problem."" Those remarks could prove to be detrimental for a candidate already struggling with women voters and with the perception that he lacks the temperament to be president. Late Monday, the Clinton campaign released a new video featuring Machado. ""He'd tell me, 'You look ugly,' or, 'You look fat,'"" Machado says in the video. ""Sometimes he'd 'play' with me and say: 'Hello, Miss Piggy,' 'Hello, Miss Housekeeping.'"" Machado also held a press call Tuesday afternoon to respond to Trump's comments and express her support for Clinton. She told reporters that watching the 2016 election was like a ""really bad dream."" ""I never imagined in 20 years later I will be in this position,"" she said. ""Watching this guy again doing stupid things and stupid comments."" Speaking in Raleigh Tuesday afternoon, Clinton continued to make digs at Trump's debate performance, saying it was ""very clear that he didn't prepare."" ""What we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent,"" she said. ""It's unclear exactly what he is saying, but words matter."" Marguerite Scott, a retired 68-year-old woman from Cary, North Carolina, who attended the Raleigh campaign event, said she was struck by Trump appearing to lose his composure during the debate. Scott lso chastised the GOP nominee for his comments Tuesday about Machado. ""Men in general should stop objectifying women. If she is fat, that is her business,"" Scott said.

"CLEVELAND ? Donald Trump campaigned Wednesday morning in a church in a historically African-American community and sold himself as the candidate who could fix the problems of urban America. Within hours, Trump was proposing a vast expansion of ?stop-and-frisk? policing policies that have proved explosively controversial in black communities for encouraging racial profiling. It was just another day inTrump up-and-down black outreach campaign undertaken to wash away the stain of racism charges lobbed at him by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. Story Continued Below The effort has taken Trump from a black church in inner-city Detroit earlier this month to addressing largely white audiences in rural North Carolina where, on Tuesday evening, he proclaimed in a small town named after a slaveholder that black communities ""are absolutely in the worst shape thatthey ever been in before, ever, ever, ever."" On Wednesday, Trump hit the campaign trail with former boxing promoter Don King ? who dropped the N-word before a group of pastors at a Cleveland church while extolling Trump as a ?gladiator.? King hailed Trump as the rare candidate who would overthrow the existing political system under which minorities have suffered. ?The system is the problem, andhe the only gladiator that will take on the system,? King said. After the church event, Trump sat for a ?town hall? with Fox News host and unabashed supporter Sean Hannity. Asked by an audience member what he would do to address ?violence in the black community,? Trump embraced stop-and-frisk. ?We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well,? Trump said. Fierce opposition to that policy in minority communities was among the issues that Bill de Blasio rode to prominence and, ultimately, themayor office. But even beforeTrump stop-and-frisk comments, he was taking heat for his ?ever, ever, ever? remark Tuesday night. ?I don't know what Mr. Trump is talking about to say that the situation for African-Americans is worse than it's ever been,? Rep. John Lewis, the Democratic civil rights icon, said Wednesday on MSNBC. ?Is he talking about worse than slavery? Worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination ? when we couldn't take a seat at the lunch counter and be served? Worse than being denied the right to register to vote, to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communities??Trump polling numbers among African-American voters have been dismal ? in the low single digits ? and some believe his outreach to black voters is as much about convincing moderate white voters, particularly women and those in the suburbs, that he is not racist. Trump regularly brings up his outreach to blacks ? ?What do you have to lose?? he says ? to largely white audiences. At the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland, Trump assembled an eclectic kitchen cabinet of some of his closest advisers to attest to his beliefs before a diverse crowd. Seated toTrump right was Mike Pence, his soft-spoken running mate. To his left, outspoken longtime attorney Michael Cohen. Behind him: King (?there?s only one,? Trump said), former presidential rival Ben Carson (?tough?), retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (?a tough general?) and former ""Apprentice"" star Omarosa Manigault (?a wonderful woman?), who has helped withTrump black outreach. ?I?m different from a lot of Republicans, frankly,? Trump said from the pulpit. Trump, who has called himself the ?law and order? candidate, criticized the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in Oklahoma last week. Trump said he had watched the video and that the officer may have been chokingin the fatal shooting. Trump has mostly defended the police in such incidents. ""Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, OK?? King, whom top GOP officials had pushed not to speak at the Republican National Convention due to a past manslaughter conviction, was given the prime slot of introducing Trump at a forum billed as a pastors leadership conference. King, clothed in a sparkling jacket and clutching the flags of Israel and the United States, argued repeatedly that ?the system? had oppressed minorities and women and only Trump can upend it entirely. ?Every white woman should cast a vote for Donald Trump,? said King, who also went on an extended riff about the struggles of African-Americans. ?I told Michael Jackson, I said if you're poor, you're a poor Negro ? I would use the N-word ? but if you rich, you are a rich Negro; if you are intelligent, intellectual, you're an intellectual Negro; if you're a dancing and sliding and gliding n-----, I mean, Negro,? King said. When Trump took his turn at the pulpit minutes later, he grinned, ?Ah,there only one Don King.? Before King, Cohen,Trump attorney, used his time at the church to slash at the ?disgusting, liberal, mainstream media? and its casting of Trump as a ?racist.? ?The word of the 2016 election has somehow become ?racist,?? Cohen complained. ?I?ve lost count as to how many times the disgusting, liberal, mainstream media have attempted to label Mr. Donald Trump as racist, a xenophobe and a bigot. Andlet not forget, sexist, misogynist, narcissist, Islamophobe, anti-Hispanic, anti-Semite demagogue. And countless others.It disgraceful.? Cohen said, ?Not only is Donald Trump not a racist, he believes that all people are part of one race: the human race.? Trump insisted that Democrats had abandoned black voters, and that hewouldn. ?They come and they take your vote,? Trump said, ?and they saythey see you in four years.?",0.022576361,0.003984064,0.005312085,0.007968127,0.039840637000000005,0.305444887,0.017264276000000002,2,-1,1
"Adam Walinsky once worked for President John F. Kennedy. He wrote speeches for Bobby (RFK) Kennedy, and Bill Clinton once worked on his National Committee for the Police Corps. He is a longtime Democrat operative, politician, and leader, and in a recent article for Politico, Walinsky shocked the nation when he announced that he would be voting for Donald Trump on November 8th. I was a Democrat all my life. I came to Washington to serve President John Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy. When the president was murdered and his brother struck off on his own, I joined his Senate campaign and staff as his legislative assistant and speechwriter, until his presidential campaign ended with his own assassination. I ran on a (losing) Democratic ticket in the New York state elections of 1970. When I was working to enact my own program of police reform in the 1980s and 1990s, then-Governor Bill Clinton was chairman of my National Committee for the Police Corps. This year, I will vote to elect Donald Trump as president of the United States. The question many are asking today is, why? Why would a long-time and highly respected Democrat defect at such a crucial time in our history? Why would Walinsky abandon the most establishment-friendly candidate in recent memory, to vote for a Republican outsider who eschews much of the Democrat Party platform. So profound a change, and a decent respect for old friendships, requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decision. Walinsky focused on one key aspect of the campaign ? foreign policy: Here it is. John and Robert Kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace. To them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life. Buttoday Democrats have become the Party of War: a home for arms merchants, mercenaries, academic war planners, lobbyists for every foreign intervention, promoters of color revolutions, failed generals, exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments. Walinsky hammers one key area oftoday Democrat Party that many libertarians and some conservatives have decried for years. The Democrat Party is the party of hypocrisy when it comes to war and foreign policy. The very same people who for years marched against war during the Bush administration, have fallen silent during the Obama years. This reality is stunning, considering that President Obama has led us through 8 years of constant warfare (numbers below accurate as of May 2016): ?2,499 U.S. soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan and Iraq so far under President Obama, according to the independent Iraq Coalition Casualty Count. ?Of those, 1,906 have been killed in and around Afghanistan, and 593 in Iraq. ?Under Obama, the United States has been at war for 2,687 days.That longer than under George W. Bush ? or any other U.S. president, for that matter. ?Obama has conducted airstrikes on seven countries: Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria. (That?s three more countries than George W. Bush bombed.) ?U.S. combat forces are deployed on the ground in three countries: Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria.That one more war than Obama inherited, and which his successor will likely have to contend with. Because of these truths and the reality that much ofObama foreign policy vision was crafted, developed, and carried out by Hillary Clinton, have led Walinsky to the realization that Donald Trump may be the most likely candidate to bring peace to our nation. Throughout this campaign, he has said that as president, he would quickly sit down with President Putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations, and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists. On this ground alone, he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors, earlier in the primaries and now in the general election? Donald Trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying, ?America first.? But to demand that all the actions of government, at home or abroad, be first directed at the interests and well-being of our own country is not old-fashioned or outmoded. Rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of American statesmen from the founders on. Only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens, and a full commitment to those interests, can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond. I urge you to read all ofWalinsky well-crafted argument in support of Donald Trump. He delivers paragraphs of excoriating commentary against the Democrat Party, while explaining why, despite his faults, Donald Trump may indeed be the man for this moment. If you believe America is starved for change, and many voters do, then the only candidate who offers any hope of real change is Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton not only represents ?more of the same? from Washington, D.C., she is the progenitor, and an ardent supporter of many of our worst, most ineffective policies, ideas, and plans. Voting against Clintondoesn only mean voting for change; it means voting against some of our worst political failures of the last 30 years.

"EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans? PAC To Take Trump Down A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros.

So, WHY then is Soros caught again? Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough,they funded by Soros TOO!It called ?Common Defense PAC? and their mantra is: ?As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.? Then on the ?leadership team? page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called ?Senator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.? The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org.

"The winding down of CGI stem from controversies around Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. | AP Photo Clinton Foundation to lay off dozens of staff CGI will retain other staff to work with donors into 2017, despite conflict-of-interest questions. NEW YORK ? The Clinton Global Initiative has alerted dozens of employees that their jobs will be eliminated atyear end, even as it plans to retain some staff to continue working with donors, according to two former Clinton Foundation officials who remain in communication with staff. The winding down of CGI after thisweek glitzy gathering and the resulting layoffs stem from concessions made by the Clinton Foundation to controversies swirling around HillaryClinton presidential campaign. Story Continued Below But the recent moves to sunset the project have prompted controversies of their own around the Clinton Foundation, which administers CGI. And they presage the difficulties the Clintons can be expected to face if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency and they move forward with plans to scale back the rest of the foundation. Some foundation allies grumbled that the announcement ofCGI elimination ? and of many of its positions ? was handled in an insensitive manner, according to the former officials. Others predicted that retaining some staff to work with deep-pocketed government, corporate and nonprofit donors on existing programs would only feed criticism about whether some of the businessmen, companies or foreign governments that donated to the global charity got preferential treatment from HillaryClinton State Department.It a ?bad idea? to retain CGI staff, said one of the former officials, adding, ?I really think they should make a clean break, and apparently so do most staff.? CGI at its peak employed around 200 full-time staffers. Many of those have sought ? or accepted ? new jobs in recent months as the fate of the initiative became uncertain.It not clear how many remain employed, precisely how many jobs are being eliminated at the end of the year or how many would be retained in 2017. A Clinton Foundation spokesman would not answer those questions, but he defended thefoundation handling ofCGI wind-down. ?All full-time CGI employees will have their jobs with benefits at least through the end of the calendar year,? said the spokesman. The foundation is providing departing staff with ?a wide range of resources that include career coaching, access to job leads in a variety of fields, and resume and job search strategy,? the spokesman said, explaining, ?we informed CGI staff of this transition more than four months before the end of the year, and have provided information about CGI-related roles that will continue.? Remaining staff will be working with government, corporate and individual partners that have pledged assistance for ongoing humanitarian projects around the world, the spokesman said. ?Staff will be performing a number of roles, including continuing to provide advice with respect to commitment development and commitment improvement, based on our commitment database and experience having previously developed over 3,600 commitments with our members, and continuing to facilitate introductions and partnerships between members,? the spokesman said. He added that not all of those partners give directly to the Clinton Foundation. The spokesman pointed to an open letter written by former President Bill Clinton in which he announced the sun-setting of CGI, while also crediting its partnership model for changing the face of modern philanthropy and corporate social responsibility. ?It?s been one of the great honors of my life to be part of this special community, and I hope the hard work and benefits ofCGI great staff and its members? creative cooperation will keep rippling out into the world,? Clinton wrote. In his opening remarks on Monday, Bill Clinton said, ?I think the way to end this is not on a nostalgia trip, but doing what we set up to do. Which is just keep working to push the ball forward.? Since Clinton launched CGI in 2005, its members have made more than 3,600 commitments in areas including housing, education, workforce training sustainable energy and food systems, according to thefoundation website. It says the commitments ?have improved the lives of over 435 million people in more than 180 countries.? This is the 12th and last CGI conference, regardless of whether Hillary Clinton or her Republican opponent Donald Trump win the presidency. The foundationhasn provided details on howCGI programs might continue, though many of the commitments made by CGI partners are to multi-year projects, and it is unlikely that all would wrap up at the end of this year. The foundation has provided more detail on other changes that the Clinton Foundation will enact if Hillary Clinton is elected. It will no longer accept new contributions from foreign or corporate donors and will formally change its name from the ?Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation? to the ?Clinton Foundation,? while Bill Clinton will step down from its board. CGI originally was intended as a 10-year program of the foundation. But it continued for longer, partly because it attracted so much interest ? and money ? from the corporate and NGO worlds and partly because it became BillClinton favorite showcase, according to sources who worked with the foundation. Its annual meeting is a see-and-be-seen event featuring a mix of swanky parties and high-minded discussions about finding solutions to global problems ranging from climate change to childhood obesity. Thisweek final gathering includes panels and parties featuring heads of state, Fortune 100 CEOs, Hollywood actor Ben Affleck and world-class athletes. But it also has prompted teeth-gnashing among foundation staff and allies who are concerned thatit an easy target for Trump supporters. Those concerns were exacerbated Monday when Bill Clinton conceded that some donors may have given money to the foundation to build a relationship with the Clintons or to gain access to the State Department during HillaryClinton tenure as secretary of state. Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller responded Tuesday, asking, ?Doesn?t this validate claims of pay-for-play within the organization?? Sponsors also seemed less eager to affiliate with CGI this year than in the past. The final meeting lists 23 sponsors, down from 33 last year and 46 at the annualmeeting height, in 2011. Notable dropouts this year include Coca-Cola, which sponsored the event the last three years, and Barclays, a sponsor since 2010. Longtime sponsor Goldman Sachs also declined to participate this year. Some staffers grumbled after being told that theycouldn leave after the meeting and receive severance through the end of the year, so that they could hunt for jobs full-time, said the former foundation official. Instead, the former official said they are ?being asked to stay until the end of December to update data into a database.? Few staffers were informed about the move before it was announced in an August staff meeting by foundation CEO Donna Shalala and Bill Clinton, said the former official. Since then,they learned their fate on a piecemeal basis, according to two people with knowledge of the process. ?It was poorly managed, treated too glibly, patronizingly, completely lacking empathy at the fact that so many young people were going to be laid off,? said the former official.",0.034146341000000004,0.001219512,0.003658537,0.017073171,0.054878049000000005,0.22195122,0.001219512,2,-1,1

"Donald Trump is turning to Snapchat to drum up support from young voters ahead of tonight's presidential debate. The Republican candidate's campaign launched a nationwide filter on the popular social network Monday. While some candidates including Hillary Clinton have paid for local Snapchat filters during regional events in the past, this is the first sponsored political filter available nationwide. Snapchat users now have the option to take selfies and photos with a picture frame design that says ""Debate Day: Donald J. Trump vs. Crooked Hillary"" before sharing with friends. The filter also features fireworks on the sides and a banner at the bottom with his campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Related: Say hello to Snap Inc. Anyone can create a filter on Snapchat using the app's Geofilters feature, but its availability is typically limited to proximity to an event, location or community. It's unclear how much Trump's campaign paid for the filter to show up for users nationwide. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sponsored filters have long been a way for Snapchat -- now rebranded as Snap Inc. -- to bring in ad dollars, in addition to showing sponsored videos within the app. Related: 100 million? Ratings expectations for first Trump-Clinton debate Trump and Clinton have used other social media networks, including Twitter (TWTR) and Facebook (FB), to target younger audiences. But Snapchat is notoriously popular with teens and millennials -- a core group of voters both candidates hope to win over. ""Rather than actually try and persuade people, the Trump campaign is throwing money into a fire pit,"" the Clinton campaign said in a statement. ""[This features] a joke that, given Trump's deep unpopularity with young voters, will be used mainly at their own expense."" Recent polls suggest Clinton has failed to gain the kind of enthusiasm that drove younger voters to the polls four and eight years ago. Between the two major party candidates, Clinton has used Snapchat more so far. Earlier this year, Clinton's camp launched a filter which targeted those attending a Trump rally in California. Clinton also released one during the Republican National Convention, which featured a quote from Trump about how Clinton would make a great president.

Story Continued Below Following a series of planted bombs in New York and New Jersey over the weekend and a stabbing in Minnesota, Trump on Monday hammered Clinton on her record amid increasing concerns regarding the terrorist network and the threat of domestic attacks. The real estate mogul again blamed Clinton and Obama for refusing to utter the words ?radical Islamic terrorism? and accused them of emboldening terrorists across the globe. ?Today, Hillary Clinton showed again that she will say anything ? and blame anyone ? to shift attention away from the weakness she showed as Secretary of State,? he said in a statement Monday, adding that terrorists are ?hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes President so that they can continue their savagery and murder.? Trump vowed to ?bring an end to these senseless acts of violence? and condemned the White House, whose spokesman referred to the battle against the Islamic State as a ?narrative fight.? ?They are wrong to say thatwe in a fight about ?narratives,?? Trump said. ?These terrorists pose an existential threat to our country, our values, and our way of life.?",0.04784689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.076555024,0.377990431,0.052631579000000005,2,-1,1
"New York  Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump face off for the first time on the debate stage Monday night, the biggest moment of the already extraordinary 2016 presidential race. With national polls showing a tight race just six weeks out from Election Day, the Hofstra University fight offers one of the last chances for each to speak directly to the tens millions of voters who are expected to tune in. For Clinton, a veteran debater, one of her biggest challenges will be both to provoke Trump and avoid being provoked by him, while delivering an earnest and candid performance. And for Trump, who had uneven and at times explosive debate performances during the Republican primary, his first one-on-one debate presents a serious test of his ability to stay on script and keep his cool. Here are five things to watch at Monday night's debate: Which Donald Trump will show up? During the long Republican primary, there was no telling which Trump would show up to a debate. Sometimes it was the combative and hostile Trump -- quick to throw punches and go after his opponents with personal attacks. Other times, it was an uncharacteristically subdued Trump, content to disappear from the spotlight for long stretches of time and let his competitors command the stage and attack one another. ""We are preparing for different Trumps that might show up,"" Clinton spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri told reporters last week. ""He may be aggressive or he may lay back and that's hard to game out."" JUST WATCHED Top advisers to Obama, Bush preview Monday's debate Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Top advisers to Obama, Bush preview Monday's debate 07:58 Being overtly antagonistic toward Clinton would be a risky move for Trump. If he is unable to keep calm and stay focused, it will only feed the narrative that he lacks the temperament to be president and potentially make him look small next Clinton, who is famous for being measured. Trump also won't have the option of sitting on the sidelines. As one of only two candidates on stage, the Republican nominee must make the most of every minute allotted to him and show a level of agility and rapid-response instincts that was far less critical on a debate stage with numerous candidates. Monday night will pose a critical test for Trump, who has so far shown a relative lack of depth on policy. With approximately half of the debate's 90 minutes dedicated to the GOP nominee, it will be far more difficult than in past debates for Trump to get by with sweeping statements that he is accustomed to making at rallies and in interviews, particularly given that Clinton's strong suit is policy. Can Clinton heed Obama advice to 'be yourself?' No one understands Clinton's debating chops better than President Barack Obama, who faced off against her numerous times in the 2008 election. Obama's advice to Clinton for Monday? ""Be yourself and explain what motivates you,"" the President told ABC's Robin Roberts last week . ""I think there's a reason why we haven't had a woman president before, and so she's having to break down some barriers. There's a level of mistrust and a caricature of her that just doesn't jibe with who I know."" So far in this campaign, Clinton has struggled to do precisely that, and appearing unguarded and likeable -- fairly or not -- has been one of her biggest political challenges. There's no question that policy is Clinton's forte -- aides to the former senator and secretary of state describe her as a wonk who knows policy inside and out. As she marshals her fluency in policy, she will want to avoid coming off as lecturing or smug, the way critics say Al Gore did in his debates with George W. Bush. But appearing next to Trump could help make Clinton more likable by comparison: Polls show that a majority of voters question Trump's temperament and view him as appealing to bigotry. The Clinton campaign says it plans to drive home the point that Trump habitually makes factually inaccurate statements. ""Donald Trump has pattern of repeating lies hoping no one will correct him,"" Palmieri, Clinton's communications director, said on a call with reporters last week. ""This warrants particular focus because his level of lying is unprecedented in American politics."" Clinton has acknowledged that she doesn't have the natural charisma of Obama or her husband, Bill Clinton, but she has fleshed out her personal story and offered a sharper positive message in recent weeks, and she will likely attempt to continue that effort on Monday. Things could get really personal The 2016 election has already showcased a whole lot of nasty name-calling, but Monday night has the potential to descend into the worst mudfight yet. Even before the debate had begun, the two campaigns were in full trolling mode. The Clinton campaign offered Mark Cuban -- the TV celebrity billionaire who recently endorsed the Democratic nominee -- a front row seat at Hofstra. Cuban has been relentless in attacking Trump-- in July, he said Trump ""went off the reservation and went bats -- crazy"" -- and he has also called out Trump for not releasing his tax returns. JUST WATCHED They can't say that on a debate stage...can they? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH They can't say that on a debate stage...can they? 01:23 Having Cuban in the front row is the kind of mind game that the Clinton camp hopes will distract and throw Trump off his game. But in Trumpian fashion, the GOP nominee responded over the weekend by threatening to bring Gennifer Flowers as his guest to the debate. Flowers is a former Arkansas state employee who claimed to have had a multi-year sexual relationship with Bill Clinton. The former president has admitted to having a sexual encounter with her. The Trump campaign later said it won't invite Flowers to the debate. Still, Trump's comments may foreshadow his willingness to dredge up some of the most painful incidents from the Clintons' past, including Bill Clinton's various indiscretions. Hillary Clinton, too, could go there if provoked -- Trump has been married three times and has two messy divorces under his belt; has openly boasted in the past about his playboy lifestyle. Moreover his offensive remarks about women and minorities are part of her campaign's argument he is temperamentally unfit to be president. Asked by CNN on her plane earlier this month whether she believes it is fair game to go after Trump's personal life, Clinton didn't rule out the possibility. Trump, meanwhile, said on Fox News last week: ""If she treats me with respect, I will treat her with respect."" The politics of race There's no shortage of top-tier issues -- terrorism, Syria, ISIS, immigration, the economy among them -- but the first general election match-up comes amid national outrage sparked yet again by police killings of African-American men. The recent deaths of Keith Lamont Scott in North Carolina and Terence Crutcher in Oklahoma have sparked fresh and impassioned calls for justice and protests that have at times turned violent. With the issue of police force -- particularly toward minorities -- dominating headlines, the politics of race is guaranteed to be a discussion topic. Both Clinton and Trump had planned to visit Charlotte -- where Scott was killed -- around the debate: Clinton on Sunday and Trump on Monday. But both campaigns scrapped those plans after Charlotte mayor Jennifer Roberts told CNN's Erin Burnett that the city was too stretched on resources. For both Clinton and Trump, the challenge will be to offer detailed proposals on how they would address unnecessary police violence and thoughtfully speak to a grieving community. It also gives both a chance to make arguments to key constituencies -- Clinton to African-Americans who voted with Obama, and Trump to GOP base voters with his ""law and order"" pitch. The debate will likely delve into many other policy issues including healthcare, trade, economy and foreign policy. But many of the core disagreements between Trump and Clinton are rooted in the different ways in which they view race and inclusion. The two nominees have starkly contrasting views on immigration, for example, and how to handle people who enter the country illegally. They also clash on the national security front ? particularly on how they want to combat terrorism. Clinton has urged measured responses that ensure that an entire religion is not villanized -- Trump, meanwhile, has suggested using methods of racial profiling and keeping out entire ethnic groups as a safety measure. All eyes on Lester Holt No one who will face more pressure Monday night than Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump -- except Lester Holt The NBC ""Nightly News"" anchor and veteran newscaster is about to enter uncharted territory as the moderator of the first Clinton-Trump face-off. Monday will mark Holt's first time presiding over a general election presidential debate; some 70 to 100 million people are expected to tune in; and there is no telling what dynamics will drive ultimately drive the prime-time event. Both campaigns have preemptively cranked up the heat, suggesting that Holt and the other moderators might be less than fair to their respective candidates. Palmieri told reporters last week that her biggest concern heading into the debate is that Trump and Clinton will be graded on different curves.

Manhattan-based U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein agreed with federal prosecutors that suspect Ahmad Rahami need not have an initial federal court appearance until he is taken into federal custody. And, by all appearances, he's currently in the custody of local officials in New Jersey, the magistrate said. ""The [federal] Government explicitly denies that it has arrested the defendant. There is no evidence to the contrary,"" Gorenstein wrote in a two-page order released Wednesday evening. Gorenstein noted that defense lawyers said ""it is undisputed that federal law enforcement are involved in detaining and questioning"" Rahami. ""In fact, this question is very much in dispute,"" the magistrate wrote. ""The Government asserts unequivocally that the defendant 'is not in federal custody ... Whether there are federal authorities questioning defendant does not address the issue of custody. At this point, the Court has no evidence whatsoever from anyone with personal knowledge that the defendant is being detained by any federal officer."" The magistrate also rejected defense lawyers' claims that a federal court rule requires Rahami be promptly arraigned on the federal charges even if he is arrested by state authorities. Gorenstein not only declined to schedule a court appearance for Rahami, who's at a Newark hospital and could have been arraigned there, but said he lacks authority to appoint the court's indigent defense providers at the Federal Defenders of New York to formally represent Rahami. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday morning that Rahami will be brought to New York City in the ""near future"" to face the federal complaint there, which is expected to take precedence over attempted murder charges filed in county court in New Jersey and another federal complaint in the Garden State. A spokesman for U.S. Attorney PreetBharara office declined to comment on the decision, saying the ruling could speak for itself.

"Now we have officially seen it all! This is the definition of insanity. Chelsea Manning. The same Chelsea Manning who was imprisoned for leaking classified government documents appears to be running for the U.S. Senate. Federal Election Commission documents show Chelsea Elizabeth Manning of North Bethesda Maryland has filed paperwork to run as a Democrat, of course. Can You imagine the person who posted this as a US Senator? This is a move that would put her against two-term Democrat Senator Ben Cardin in thestate June Democrat primary ballot. Cardin isMaryland senior U.S. senator, and the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Although media has tried to contact her/him/it Manning did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nor had she released any statement announcing her candidacy as of midafternoon Saturday. Via The Blaze: Bradley Manning is still a traitor. Andhe also still a man. The Democrats have, for several months now, been in a state of convulsive rage over WikiLeaks. They tell us that WikiLeaks is in league with Putin. They tell us that WikiLeaks subverted our system and destabilized the very foundations of our democracy. WikiLeaks stole the election. Sabotage! So on and so forth. With this in mind, it seems a little odd that right in the midst of this apocalyptic hand wringing over WikiLeaks, the president would choose to commute the sentence of a guy who went into a war zone, stole reams of classified files, and gave them to WikiLeaks. Bradley Manningdidn merely release email correspondences between DNC officials where they complain about Bernie Sanders and talk about spirit cooking. Theseweren embarrassing revelations about a political party. These were hundreds of thousands of secret documents relating to national security, appropriated during a time of war, and leakedindiscriminately with no regard to how it would undermine our war efforts and even less regard for the lives it put at risk. The Democrats apparently want us to believe that humiliating Hillary Clinton is a far worse crime than jeopardizing the safety of our troops, intelligence officers, and allies. The word outrageousdoes not even begin to describewhat going on here. It would appear self-defeating as well. Why would the Democrats ? who have almost unanimously applauded this move, by the way ? suddenly decide to undermine their own case against WikiLeaks? Shameful hypocrisy has never slowed them down before, granted, but even by their standards this is a rather extreme case of it. They must know thatthey made it impossible for anyone to take them seriously the next time they whine about email leaks and ?election hacking.? It so discredits them, makes so little sense, makes them look so utterly foolish, renders their own arguments so fantastically irrelevant, that you may conclude that the entire Democrat Party has gone into a state of collective psychosis.That not a bad theory. Not too far from the truth, either. But there is, you might say, a method to this madness. And you can understand the method once you understand that, in the world of modern leftism, the letters LGBToverride anything and everything. At the very top of the progressive Victimhood Hierarchy sit the members of this elite club. Any opportunity to advance their cause must be exploited. Any time the Great Cause and some other concern collides, the Cause wins out. These are the priorities of leftism nowadays. Its only one priority, really. Nothing ? and I truly mean nothing ? is more important than its sexual agenda. So, Bradley Manning, a traitor to the United States who gave assistance to the enemy, a convicted spy who would have been put in front of a firing squad not too long ago, will now be a free and celebrated man for one single reason: he pretendshe not a man. Because Manning ?came out? as transgenderafter committing his act of treachery, he became a hero to the Left. A trans hero, specifically, which is the most heroic kind of hero.That why he will be getting out of prison. For that reason and no other. The Left admitted upfront that it wants Manning out of prison solely because he cross dresses. Before his commutation was announced, the media wrote story after story describing the ?bleak life? of a womanin amen prison. They insisted thatit an injustice to force a woman to remain incarcerated with men. Andthey right, that would be an injustice; but no such injustice had actually occurred. Bradley Manning was a man when he entered prison.He a man now.He be a man when he leaves.He be a man until he dies and even still afterwards. Complaining that a ?transgender woman?wasn transferred to awomen prison is like complaining that a lunatic who thinkshe a polar bearwon be transferred to the local zoo. As per usual, Manning had already been given enormous privileges thanks to his transgenderstatus. The government was bending over backwards, going to extraordinary lengths, to accommodate his delusions: She can now wear female prison undergarments, including a sports bra, and ?subdued cosmetics.? In early 2015, she was permitted to get speech therapy to feminize the tone and pitch of her voice and began cross-sex hormone therapy prescribed, Mr. Strangio said, by an endocrinologist brought in from themilitary Walter Reed hospital. Since then, Ms. Manning wrote, she has developed breasts and curvier hips. ?There have been significant changes sinceI been taking the hormones, and I am happy with them,? she said. But, citing security risks, the military rejected the recommendation of an outside psychologist who said she should be permitted to further feminize her appearance by growing her hair longer than male military standards. Mr. Strangio is helping her challenge that restriction. But thiswasn enough. It never is. We were using tax money to facilitate the sexual fantasies of a traitor, but still the Left was not satisfied. They never are.Manning transgenderstatusshouldn merely entitle him to privileges in prison, they demanded. It ought to entitle him to a get-out-of-jail-free card. The laws against espionage ought to be suspended in his case. Let other spies and traitors face the just consequences, but not Manning.He better than them.He more important.He at the top of the Victimhood Hierarchy. Let him out and nextwe complain of persecution if heisn immediately named Nobel laureate, Medal of Honor recipient, and honorary Wheel of Fortune champion. Obama was happy to oblige, to the extent that he could. And now this will stand as one of the most deranged and despicable thingshe done as president, which is saying something. An impressive grand finale to a shameful presidency. Manning, who is a transgender formerly known as Bradley Manning, was convicted by a court-martial back in 2013 of leaking hundreds of thousands of classified documents to WikiLeaks and sentenced to 35 years in prison. A sentence that then President Barack Hussein Obama was more than happy to commute. Manning was released from a military prison last year after serving seven years for something she should have hung for.Don you all just miss the old days? The days when a man was a man and a woman was a woman. The days when you knew how to address a person without them having a fit over it. And to top it all off now this traitor will be running for the United States Senate? Huh? Can we please once again start electing people who have the qualifications for office, not because of their skin color or sexual preferences?Let leave aside the fact that this individual is severely disturbed and confused. She is a traitor and should not even be allowed to run for a public office which gives you the ability to handle classified information.

"Washington  The first presidential debate broke viewing records Monday, but a number of key Senate Republicans getting grilled over Donald Trump's Miss Universe comments say they either weren't watching or don't have an opinion on one of the night's signature moments. ""I didn't get to see it. I was traveling back from Utah. Stupid plane wouldn't let us tie into CNN. So I felt bad about that. I'm going to talk to them,"" Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch said. ""I didn't see it guys, I was on an airplane,"" Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, one of Trump's former GOP primary rivals, told reporters. Sen. Ted Cruz, who only fully embraced Trump last Friday, didn't want to talk to reporters. ""We put out a statement last night,"" he told CNN, as he ran into the Senate chamber. Those who claimed to missed the debate had it the easiest. As they have all year long, GOP lawmakers have been in a bind as they were forced to confront the latest controversial statement from Trump. Tuesday, the questions were about the debate and his comments about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. Hillary Clinton placed his comments blasting former Machado for putting on too much weight front and center Monday night, and Trump fueled the fire Tuesday morning on Fox News. ""And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest -- he loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them -- and he called this woman 'Miss Piggy,' then he called her 'Miss Housekeeping' because she was Latina,"" Clinton said Monday night. ""Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a US citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November."" But GOP lawmakers who praised Trump's debate performance ducked questions about Machado. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was asked about the Machado and Trump's debate performance, he limited his answer to just: ""On the debate, I thought he did just fine."" House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has openly criticized Trump's remarks he viewed as racist, refused to engage on Machado: ""I'm not going to get into the who said what this morning on a talk show because I didn't see it."" Dodging questions about Trump has become old hat inside the Capitol, since Trump first broke through the field of Republican candidates, and then fought his way to the nomination. Trump's accusation that the judge overseeing the Trump University lawsuit was impartial because he was ""Mexican"" (the judge, Gonzalo Curiel, is from Indiana) -- left lawmakers in a similar lurch this past June. The Trump answers have become almost perfunctory, based on Tuesday's informal survey. Indiana Sen. Dan Coats: ""No comment."" Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander: ""No comment."" Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, who is in a tough battle to hold his seat, repeatedly said, ""Not going to talk about it."" Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, was one of the only Republicans to weigh in on Trump's Miss Universe comment: ""Well, those are comments I don't agree with."" Other lawmakers had effusive praise for Trump when asked broadly about the debate, but little to say on the specifics. West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito explained that she had been listening to the debate in the car and thought Trump did an excellent job. But when asked about Trump's Miss Universe comments, she said she must have missed that part. Sen. Joni Ernst, who stood on stage with Trump at her ""Roast and Ride"" event last month, said, ""I thought it was good."" But when a reporter tried to ask about specifics, she said, ""That's about all the comments I have. But thank you."" Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina got a question about Trump's answers on criminal justice reform, and said, ""I shouldn't have stopped."" Then Scott got a question about Trump taking donations from the private prison industry and he stood there, mouth shut and smiling. But when asked broadly about Trump's performance, he started talking again. ""About his performance? I think he had high points and low points, and at the end of the day I'm looking forward to the next debate with more high points,"" Scott said, as he searched for an elevator. But when he was asked what Trump's low points were, Scott stood silent for a few seconds, appearing to stall for an elevator.",0.046017699,0.005309735,0.008849558,0.012389381000000001,0.10442477900000001,0.292035398,0.0017699120000000002,2,-1,1
"NEW YORK ? All politics is geopolitical in this year's presidential race -- and top Democrats and Republicans fear that will reshapeAmerica relationships around the world no matter who wins. This week, the uncertain state of those relationships will be on full display in New York as the United Nations General Assembly gathers and the presidential contenders stage meetings meant to project which alliances they favor and which expertise they want to claim. Story Continued Below On Monday, Hillary Clinton will meet with Ukrainian President PetroPoroshenko clear dig at the developing partnership between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump.She also sit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, her campaign announced Sunday night, rejecting the suggestion that her opponent is better positioned to guide the global economy or to counter the rise of China and North Korea while reminding Americans of DonaldTrump suggestion that America should pull its support from Japan and South Korea. Clinton and Trump both have scheduled meetings with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi?an American ally, though one with dictatorial tendencies. The Democratic nominee set hers up first, aiming to project to voters thatshe up-to-speed on counter-terrorism and other issues roiling the region.Trump came second and was an attempt by Sisi to ensure even dealings, according toEgypt state news agency. Nonetheless it might offer the Republican nominee a chance to frame up a position on Middle East issues that goes beyond simply banning Muslim immigrants from America. Keeping presidential politics domestic has long been more stated tradition than reality: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not so subtly telegraphed support for Mitt Romney four years ago andObama summer 2008 foreign tour was built around a 200,000-person rally in Berlin that was projected to voters at home that they should catch up to the forward-looking Europeans and support the upstart young senator. But none of this compares to the degree to which thisyear race is defined by global affairs ? the result of the first former secretary of state in 200 years to be nominated for president and the challenges Trump has made throughout his campaign to fundamentals of American foreign policy. Clinton is already planning, if elected, to concentrate on convincing foreign capitals that Trump and the number of votes he gets in Novemberisn a sign that they need to be worried about America turning away from them. ?She?s very concerned,? said a Clinton aide. ?There?s no doubt that when you have a major presidential candidacy saying whathe said, it has an effect on foreign policy.? Certainly, presidential politics simply no longer stops at thewater edge, and this year, it has lapped aggressively, perhaps dangerously, overAmerica borders. ?It will have lasting impact,? said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), the ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee ?It has been changed,? agreed Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), a former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and a Trump supporter. ?It gets a little bit risky when you try to bring foreign support into it.? There has been a long list of international never-befores in 2016, includingTrump decision to accept an invitation fromMexico president and then commandeer a joint press conference at the presidential palace to declareAmerica sovereign right to build a wall separating the two countries. Andthat hardly all. There was the alleged Russian-led hacking of Democratic campaign committees to dump emails and other information through WikiLeaks, Trump operatives pulling tougher language about the invasion of Crimea from the GOP party platform, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi sayinghe personally rooting for Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden saying Trumpdoesn understandNATO on a trip to Latvia last month, President Barack Obama getting asked by foreign leaders for a year to weigh in on the presidential election. And just Friday, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, speaking in Chicago, accused Trump of ?playing into the hands? of ISIL. Officials openly wonder whatClinton approach as president would be now to Mexican President EnriquePe Nieto, or how quickly and forcefully NATO would restructure if Trump wins. What if China or Russia or North Korea moves to test the new president right after Inauguration Day? What if an international economic or humanitarian crisis erupts? While many inWashington diplomatic community say they have a clearer sense of how Clinton, as opposed to Trump, would want to respond, doubts are growing that either would be able to summon the national resolve to do. Her meetings this week are about twisting the knife politically on Trump, the aide acknowledged, butthey also about thinking through what being on the job on Jan. 20 might entail. Take Poroshenko, who is rebuking Putin just by being in office: ?It?s impossible not to read politics into it somewhat, but because of the wayTrump been talking over the course of the campaign, Secretary Clinton thinksit important from a policy standpoint,? the aide said. If Trump wins,he have to quickly confront leaders around the world who would be shocked that U.S. voters had elected him, and afraid that he would ushering in a new and dangerous world order. ?They will certainly want to see wherewe coming from,? King said. ?He will have to clarify and make it clear wherehe coming from.? If Clinton wins,she have a clean-up that Cardin and others compare to the repair mission Obama first gave her as secretary of state after the global souring on George W. Bush. Cardin,who firmly behind Clinton, ran through a litany: sitting in Harare earlier in the year, watching Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe laughing as the conversation turned from his own human rights abuses toTrump success, the conversations with leaders in bilateral meetings who quickly ditching the old diplomatic decorum to start griping, drinks afterward with officials who are even blunter. ?Can you imagine if Trump were president andwe trying to get a coalition against ISIL and we need to get the support of moderate Sunni states, and we need to do things that are perhaps against their local popular position? Can you imagine what DonaldTrump comments about Muslims coming to America would have on a leader of a moderate Muslim state?? Cardin said. ?It?s that type of problems that have now been caused.? This has all made for tricky travels for Obama, ashe spent significant time abroad this year nailing down his foreign policy legacy as president as the campaign has intensified. Being abroaddoesn stop people from asking for his take on Trump and the race, whether in closed bilateral meetings or at press conferences. Obama tends to draw his own line for where to stop himself, but critics and even occasionally his own aides can feel like he goes too far. ?It's not a mystery to people overseas that Democrats and Republicans in the United States have their differences,? said a senior administration official. ?So that's why leaders traveling overseas don't make as much of an effort to conceal it.? From the beginning of his presidency, Obama saw himself as embodying a generational shift in the world order, from shifting more of the burden in the Middle East to Arab nations to the kind of interlocking international effort that put sanctions on Putin and brought the Iranians to the nuclear negotiating table, to reopening Cuba.He make that case and the case for going forward in his own speech to the U.N. General Assembly Tuesday morning. But the argument is going to be largely defined by who his successor is. Trumpdidn run his Mexico trip by the White House. Clintondidn run her meetings this week by the White House either. ?We?re having a serious debate,? said Ivo Daalder, now the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, andObama first U.S. permanent representative to NATO. ?We?re going to live with the consequences and the impact of the debate.?",0.032258065,0.001112347,0.010011123,0.022246941,0.0567297,0.301446051,0.008898776,2,-1,1

Buy Now ?The federalgovernment refugee settlement program is riddled with serious problems that pose a threat to our nation,? Governor Abbott said in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. ?The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director of National Intelligence have repeatedly declared their inability to fully screen refugees from terrorist-based nations. Even with the inability to properly vet refugees from Syria and countries known to be supporters or propagators of terrorism, President Obama is now ineptly proposing a dramatic increase in the number of refugees to be resettled in the U.S.? I fully expect this same attitude to be adopted by all Republican states thataren run by progressives. This is something that needs to be shared across the United States and taken up by the federal government. There is no reason why the people we elected to protect us from foreign enemies should be importing people who could be putting us at risk.Abbot reactionwasn in response to the latest bombings in the United States, thoughI thoroughly convinced that was at the very least in the back of his mind. Instead, his comments came after the Texas Health and Human Services Commission wrote a letter to the head of the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement. In follow up to our request for approval of our application for an amended State Plan, I write to express the state of Texas? intentions should you not unconditionally approve our application by September 30, 2016. The 2016 State Plan will no longer be current and continue in effect after September 30, 2016. That date is quickly approaching, and the Office of Refugee Resettlement has not yet approved our application for an amended State Plan. If you do not approve our State Plan as amended by September 30, 2016, we will interpret your silence as a rejection of the application. If our application is rejected -whether explicitly or by silence ? the Health and Human Services Commission will be unable to certify that its State Plan is current and in effect, and will exit the Refugee Resettlement Program. We will notify contractors and impacted stakeholders that services and benefits will be provided for 120 days beyond October 1, 2016, or until January? 31, 2017.

"Scroll down for video For those folks paying close attention to the national news, this last year has perhaps been an awakening for many, and no doubt a disappointment for some, as to how our judicial system really works, in that althoughwe like to think that ?justice is blind? or thatthere ?equal justice under the law? in reality there are two distinct and different although parallel systems at work within America. One for us ordinary folks, and another for those political elites, which we seldom get to see, because for the most their malfeasance is usually covered-up and committed by politicians, who for the most part are lawyers, who become judges, who become prosecutors, and who eventually become president, in short a sheepskinfor some is a legal license to steal, which of course is on full display this election season with Hillary Clinton and her gang. However as this Las Vegas Public Defender found out, wearing a ?Black Lives Matter? button into a courtroomisn exactly the smartest thing to do, in that shedoesn belong to the Political VIP Lounge, and of course what transpired next, was a visible clash of cultures taking place right there within the courtroom, as District Judge Douglas Herndon ordered attorney Erika Ballou to remove the button. ?I took an oath to support the Constitution, all of the Constitution,? Ballou said. ?My oath is to protecteveryone free speech, even if I disagree with it. I am not comfortable giving my case to someone else to handle. AndI also not comfortable abridging my free speech.? She then acknowledged she would not remove the button and wanted another judge to hear the case, which of course Herndon refused to recuse himself. ?We?re not here on a petition about a movement or a protest or anything like that,? Herndon said. ?We?re here to dispense justice on a criminal calendar of cases. Andthat why I thinkit inappropriate.? One wonders what the reaction of Attorney Ballou would be if a defendant that she was tasked to represent, walked into court wearing a Donald Trump t-shirt, and would she be as adamant in protecting thatperson free speech? Judge Herndon said, ?I?m asking the same things of them that I ask of anybody else. Please leave any kind of political or opinion protest statements outside the courtroom.?

" Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner oftonight debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States. The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon ? thank you! ? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016What curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from ? which will come as quite a surprise: Data is from Trendsmap.comThat right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advancePutin agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya.It a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow.Putin trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences. Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe. The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: ?humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.?

"Early voting has begun in the battleground state of North Carolina, and after months of contentious litigation,it clear why Republicans wanted to squash it: returns are showing Democrats with an eight point advantage over Republicans. Data analysis from TargetSmart (who partnered with NBC News) shows that of the 4,000 plus presidential ballots that have been cast, 42 percent come from registered Democrats, 34 percent from Republicans, 25 percent from unaffiliated, and 1 percent from Libertarians. Contrast that to 2012, when Mitt Romney won North Carolina by two percent: in early voting that year in that state, Republicans held a five percent lead. Now Democrats hold an eight percent lead. In 2008, when President Obama won (by a slim margin of 0.33 percent), Democrats had an 11 point advantage. In 2004, Democrats had an 11 point advantage, but Kerry lost to Bush by 13 percent. So whileit not set in stone that whoever accumulates the most early votes wins, the last two elections (in which early voting has increased tremendously) shows that is the case. NateSilver FiveThirtyEight currently gives Clinton a 43 percent chance of winning North Carolina (and a 62 percent chance of winning the election overall).Clinton chances have gone up almost five percent in the last week, with one reason being a strong showing for Democrats in early voting. The New York Times? election model gives Clinton a 48 percent chance of winning North Carolina. Again, no wonder Governor Pat McCory, who is currently losing his re-election bid, and the GOP legislature wanted to do away with it. When Democrats get a head start, that usually means good news in November. Democratsshouldn get too comfortable. Although early voting points to a Democratic-leaning result, Republicans could very well (and chances are great) benefit from in person voting on November 8. President Obama never overcame Romney in the polls in the weeks leading up to the election, almost all the polls for the month of September favored Obama. With 45 days left until the election, anything can happen, so Democrats need to continue to mobilize, register, and get out the vote for not just early ballots, but for November 8.

Rudy Giuliani said Monday night. The former New York City mayor made the remark, captured on video and posted to Twitter by Elite Daily writer Alexandra Svokos, in response to a question aboutClinton attack onTrump past comments about women. Giuliani defended Trump, labeling him a feministbecause of how he treats the women he employs, and said he would have responded toClinton attacks much more harshly than the GOP nominee did.

And after being married to Bill Clinton for 20 years, if youdidn know the moment Monica Lewinsky said that Bill Clinton violated her that she was telling the truth, thenyou too stupid to be president.? Trump himself said Monday night and again Tuesday morning that he had considered raising the formerpresident history of marital infidelities as a response to the former secretary ofstate attacks. He opted against it, he said, because thecouple daughter, Chelsea Clinton, was in attendance and he though such an attack would be in poor taste.

"Never has the ?rights for me, but not for thee? idea been more apparent than in the context of gun control. Politicians love to parade around with families of mass shooting victims, particularly if those victims were schoolchildren. They talk about how no one needs ten bullets to kill a deer, and they talk about how semi-automatic rifles ? especially the black ones ? serve no purpose other than to kill a bunch of people in a short amount of time. The only kind of gun theydon seem to have a problem with is a shotgun, as long asit one that holds no more than two rounds at a time. While these same politicians use shooting victims to push their anti-gun ideas, everyone knows that they are surrounded by armed bodyguards. Yes, armed with evil guns. Donald Trump brought this up at a campaign rally in Miami, Florida. He said: ?She?s very much against the Second Amendment. She wants to destroy your Second Amendment. Guns, guns, guns, right? I think what we should do is ? she goes around with armed bodyguards, like you have never seen before. I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons. They should disarm, right? Right? I think they should disarm immediately. What do you think? Yes? Take their guns away! Shedoesn want guns.Let see what happens to her. It would be very dangerous.? Every gun control politician benefits from the Second Amendment. The high-profile ones surround themselves with security personnel who carry firearms. They know that having armed security around them protects them. But theydon want everyday Americans to be afforded the same right. For now, maybe these gun control politicians would say thatthey be okay if Americans had a shotgun at home, as long as that gun was locked up in a safe and completely disassembled, and the ammo was in an entirely different safe on the other side of the house.

"She?s on a warpath right now andit tearing up Twitter and social media outlets as we speak. This day is all about the survivor and the attacker and a day in remembrance of what happened in the90.It being considered as a terrible attack that happened in the White House that left a youngwoman reputation damaged and a President impeached. This is the story of Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky andshe celebrating her 20th year of that horrible time in American politics. The White House was disgraced. Awoman dress defaced. And everyone in the world had their eyes on the White House as an impeachment process added to the fledgling reputation of former President Bill Clinton. Monica Lewinsky claimsshe a survivor after what happened with her sexual encounter with Bill Clinton. Some call it an attack. Some call it mutual. Everyone calls it repulsive because Bill Clinton was caught in a raunchy expose with an intern while he was married to Hillary Clinton. But Hillarydidn leave his side. She stayed on the path of politics, not caring much about what her husband was into (or putting into) and she usedBill name and reputation to push her career forward while he took a back seat after his romp with Lewinsky. Bill Clinton was probed 20-years ago and the memory and backlash of the sexual encounter have always left a stain on the reputation of Lewinsky. Thatdidn stop her from being successful in her ventures after the impeachment of Bill Clinton. She refused to allow the incident with the former President of the United States to stop her in on the path to success. She pushed forward, full steam ahead, and she brandished herself a survivor. Shewasn physically attacked with punches, kicks, or weapons, but her character was nearly assassinated. She went from being an intern to a name everyone knows. People know her, her dress, and something about cigars that wewon get into. And now, still, Lewinsky pushes on as she claims herself a survivor from what was possibly her most tumultuous year. Gateway Pundit reports: ?Twenty years ago today Special Counsel Kenneth Starr contacted Attorney General Janet Reno to get permission to expand his probe of Bill Clinton. Janet Reno agreed and submitted the request to a panel of three federal judges. The judges agree to allow Starr to formally investigate the possibility of subornation of perjury and obstruction of justice in the Jones case. Tripp and Lewinsky meet again at the Ritz-Carlton. FBI agents and U.S. attorneys intercede and take Lewinsky to a hotel room, where they question her and offer her immunity. Lewinsky contacts her mother, Marcia Lewis, who travels down from New York City by train. Lewis contacts her ex-husband, who calls attorney William Ginsburg, a family friend. Ginsburg advises her not to accept the immunity deal until he learns more. Three days later, an January 19, 1998, Matt Drudge at The Drudge Report broke the story first on the Monica Lewinsky Scandal. And that led to the impeachment vote of President Bill Clinton.? Is the combination of Matt Drudge and Monica Lewinsky the reason for BillClinton impeachment? Perhaps as a secondary reason. The true reason for BillClinton impeachment is Bill Clinton himself. His inability to remain distant from Monica Lewinsky, regardless of who approached who is the sole reason an impeachment was ever more than an idea. If he allowed himself to be in close quarters and inadvertently in a sexual encounter with an intern, then the full blame must be placed on him. Citizens have extremely high standards for the President of the United States of America and sexual encounters with an intern are not on the unwritten list of approved behaviors. Monica Lewinsky shared her 20-year anniversary Tweet and it began a chain of survivor Tweets.It a great story to see her posting positive messages to the public. However, we must remember that it takes two to tango. Since she was an intern, then it must have been theworld biggest accomplishment to ?hook up? with the President. But for Bill Clinton, he let down his wife, his country, and his intern when he allegedly engaged in sexual activity. Bill Clinton should have said NO so that Monica Lewinskydidn have to say #MeToo. Butlet not forget ? the encounter with Bill Clinton was only the beginning.Don forget what Hillary did to try and ruin her life. Hillary may not have slept with Monica Lewinsky, but Mrs. Clinton is very capable of doing a lot of other things. Monica has gotten off easy. Enjoy her Tweets.Her is somewhat whiny, but there are some true survivors in the pack and may God be with them all. ?????? for 20 years, i've marked 16 jan as the day i survived another year from 1998. on this 20th (!!!) anniversary, thinkin' maybe we could try a survivor's chain. whaddya think?

"?I think right now everybody is focused on Nov. 8,"" Sen. John Thune says. | AP Photo Congress eyes the exit doors Lawmakers rolled into the Capitol earlier this month bracing for one last round of fireworks before sprinting out of town until after the election. But as Congress prepares to wrap up as early as this week leaving the Capitol dark until November, lawmakers are exiting more with a whimper than a bang. Story Continued Below The reason?Everybody got Election Day on the brain. ?I?m glad therewasn [drama],? Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said in an interview. ?I think right now everybody is focused on Nov. 8 and any consequential legislative action probablydoesn take place until after that.? That warning of a government shutdown Harry Reid delivered heading into the session? Not happening. ?I think the Senate probably [finishes] by the middle of the week and us maybe by the end, maybe spill over into the week after,? said a relaxed Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a senior member on the House Appropriations Committee, when asked to predict how they wrap up. The Senate has teed up a key procedural vote Monday on a stopgap bill to fund government agencies until mid-December, after staffers worked over the weekend to put the finishing touches on a proposal that would satisfy both sides. Most of the wrangling ? over Planned Parenthood language related to Zika funding, disaster relief for flooded Louisiana and internet domain oversight ? has unfolded behind the scenes. The Senate has taken the lead, a move some considered necessary after House conservatives threatened to withhold support for a bill thatdidn go into next year. ?I?d rather it start [the process in the House], but I think the speaker had enough of a challenge to go from six months to three months and considers that, I think, his contribution to the cause,? said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). ?Whenyou writing a bill in one house, then that house dominates the framework.? The fundingd is considered a loss for House GOP hard-liners, who were initially pushing for a bill that funded government agencies into early next year, which would have forced a new Congress to relitigate the issue with a new president. But even House conservatives seem resigned to a continuing resolution (CR) that ends in December, even if theydon like it. ?For people who think that a short-term CR is better than a long-term CR, it justdoesn make much sense to me,? said Rep. Bill Flores (R-Texas), chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee. But, ?because Senate Republicans have caved, really the only likely path forward is a short-term CR,? he added. One unrelated issue could still produce some 11th-hour drama. Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kansas) has threatened to force a vote to impeach the IRS commissioner this week, even after House Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) reached a last-minute deal to postpone the vote until after the election. Under the terms of the handshake agreement, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen will testify before the Judiciary Committee Wednesday under oath, giving Jordan and other Freedom Caucus members the hearingthey been demanding for months. Still,Koskinen lawyers sent a letter to Goodlatte Friday warning that the hearingwasn an official impeachment proceeding andshouldn be treated as such. ?Testimony under oath from a single witness ? before he has even been allowed to see any evidence against him and with no right to present corroborating evidence to address false or mistaken allegations ? is no substitute,?Koskinen lawyers wrote. It remains to be seen what Huelskamp will do. His spokesman Jon Meadows did not return multiple requests from POLITICO seeking clarification on thecongressman plans. The House Freedom Caucushasn voted to officially support the deal to push a floor vote on Koskinen until after the election, but insiders expect thegroup members to get behind it. That has Republicans on the other side of the Capitol breathing a sigh of relief. ?I know there are a lot of people who feel passionately over [in the House] about that vote butI not sure, at this point, what that accomplishes,? Thune said. ?I just think that was some drama that probablywasn necessary right now.?",0.036259542,0.005725191,0.007633588,0.009541985,0.061068702,0.22137404600000002,0.0,2,-1,1
"When reading an article like this, think of manmade global warming? Government funding of scientific research has a corrupting influence that could cause more unethical behavior among researchers, according to a new study by scientists at Virginia Tech. Researchers found federal funding is encouraging scientists to falsify data and publish bad research. The study found that universities are making the problem worse by mostly hiring young scientists as adjuncts, not tenure-track positions, which increases the financial pressures causing them to distort science. ?Over the last 50 years, we argue that incentives for academic scientists have become increasingly perverse in terms of competition for research funding, development of quantitative metrics to measure performance, and a changing business model for higher education itself,? Marc Edwards and Siddhartha Roy, researchers at Virginia Tech, wrote in their study. Edwards was the scientist who helped expose that the Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) top Midwest official knew about the Flint, Michigan drinking water crisis months before telling the public. ?Furthermore, decreased discretionary funding at the federal and state level is creating a hypercompetitive environment between government agencies (e.g., EPA, NIH, CDC), for scientists in these agencies, and for academics seeking funding from allsources combination of perverse incentives and decreased funding increases pressures that can lead to unethical behavior,? they wrote. Government funding of research produces enormous financial incentives for scientists to engage in dubious laboratory research. Academics are under serious financial pressure to rapidly and continually publish research to sustain or further their careers, even if the research is essentially useless or misleading. Even major scientific journals like Nature are asking ?Is Science Broken?? ?The first problem are that the government provides monopoly funding for fields which are related to regulatory efforts, and much of that funding is spent with a foregone conclusion in mind,? Dr. Pat Michaels, the Director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute who was not involved in the study, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. ?Wedon fund billions and billions of dollars of climate research each year to find that global warmingisn a problem. Politics has intruded into the scientific process.? Due to this monopoly, scientists also have a huge incentive to tweak, or outright fake, statistical analyses to make results seem significant or to align with government priorities. A growing number of scientists have noticed the wave of retractions, especially among social scientists. Polling indicates that such consequences are causing science itself to become less trusted. ?It also raises legitimate and disturbing questions as to whether accepting research funding from federal agencies is inherently unethical ornot agencies clearly have conflicts similar to those that are accepted and well understood for industry research sponsors,? Edwards and Roy continue in the study. ?Given the mistaken presumption of research neutrality by federal funding agencies, the dangers of institutional research misconduct to society may outweigh those of industry-sponsored research.? A study found that 34 percent of researchers self-report that they have engaged in ?questionable research practices,? including ?dropping data points on a gut feeling? and ?changing the design, methodology, and results of a study in response to pressures from a funding source,? whereas 72 percent of those surveyed knew of colleagues who had done so. Virginia Tech researchers note that the National Science Foundation estimates that research misconduct creates over $110 million in annual costs. ?The second problem is that universities are biased towards federal funding, and will thus always be cheer-leading towards a dire view and treat people whodon share that view very badly,? Dr. Michaels continued. ?We?ve seen that repeatedly in climate science. There are enormous selective pressures to publish research that is dire and not publish research that is not.We creating biased canons of research because nobody will get a federal grant to study if global warming will have beneficial effects. The peer reviewers have a vested interest in making sure that the gravy train keeps rolling down the track.? In addition to outright fraud, these incentives lead to researchers not even bothering to write up negative results, as scientific journals tend to only publish the flashiest and most popular research. This biases the scientific canon and leads to duplication of research. Only seemingly groundbreaking research can lead to government grant money, scientific prizes, and potential tenure track jobs. ?The entire American model of getting published, getting funded, then getting promoted means that peoplearen publishing negative results,? Michaels told TheDCNF.They only publishing flashy research. Getting published in Science, Nature or Cell is a ticket to future funding, promotion and tenure. This is giving young scientists an incentive to go into flashy fields that might get them on television, not important ones. This has created systematic problems in science.? As a result of these problems, researchers have a documented tendency to find evidence of phenomenons they happen to believe in and to reject observations that are unpopular with federal funders. In a survey of two thousand research psychologists conducted in 2011, over half admitted they selectively reported experiments, which gave the result they were after.

"Harry Reid: 'Donald Trump is a racist' Donald Trump is a racist, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said on the Senate floor Monday afternoon, and the media has been negligent by refusing to label him as such. ?Virtually every time Donald Trump says or does something discriminatory -- and that's often -- the media relies upon a catalog of buzzwords to describe his actions,? Reid (D-Nev.) said Monday. ?The press uses words like hateful, intolerant, bigot, extremist, prejudice, to name but a few. Yet there's always one word that many of the press conspicuously avoid: racist. They never label Trump as a racist. But he is a racist. Donald Trump is a racist.? Story Continued Below In his Senate floor remarks, Reid said ?racist is a term Idon throw around lightly,? and detailed a handful of the allegations of discriminatory behavior leveled against the GOP nominee. The Nevada senator recalled the housing discrimination lawsuit filed against Trump in the 1970s, when his real estate company was sued for steering minority applicants away from buildings with mostly white tenants and marking their applications with a cor the number nine. He also quoted a former employee of one ofTrump Atlantic City, New Jersey, casinos who recalled an edict from the Manhattan billionaire that black employees be pulled off the casino floor whenever he visited. Reid saidTrump racism has ?reached new heights? during his White House bid. He ticked offTrump support for the so-called birthermovement, his proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States and his comment ? uttered when he first announced his candidacy ? that Mexican immigrants ""are bringing drugs,they bringing crime,they rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.? He also highlightedTrump attacks against U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who the Manhattan billionaire has accused of bias in presiding over a fraud case against him because of thejudge Mexican heritage. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) calledTrump attacks ?the textbook definition of a racist comment.? ?Here we are seven weeks from Election Day, and the speaker of the house and Senate Republican leader are both endorsing this racist man. We probably should not support a man for president who by their speaker's own admission is a textbook definition of a racist,? Reid said. ?Think of the example he's setting for our nation's youth. Republicans are normalizing this racist behavior. This will be their legacy, one of them. They got plenty to add to that.? ?It's time for Republicans to stop closing their eyes to Donald Trump's racism, and it's time for reporters and journalists to be honest with the American people,? Reid added. ?They owe America the truth. Through his words and deeds, Donald Trump is a racist.?",0.025862068999999998,0.0,0.005747126,0.005747126,0.040229885,0.295977011,0.040229885,2,-1,1
" A ninety-six-year-old World War II veteran and longtime New Yorker contributor Roger Angell has voted in eighteen elections. As he prepares to vote in his nineteenth, he has published an op-ed in which he shares his wisdom and experience ? and sends a dire warning to the American people. This man, who has lived through the most dangerous threats to ever face our nation, including the prospect of nuclear Armageddon, believes that the election of Republican nominee Donald Trump would be a catastrophe on the same level: ?My country faces a danger unmatched in our history since the Cuban missile crisis, in 1962, or perhaps since 1943, when the Axis powers held most of Continental Europe, and Imperial Japan controlled the Pacific Rim, from the Aleutians to the Solomon Islands, with the outcome of that war still unknown. ? Angell acknowledgesTrump long history of outrageously offensive statements but chooses to focus on the one closest to his heart: military service and the lessons of the Second World War, the most destructive conflict humanity has ever fought. ?I stick at a differentmoment lighthearted comment he made when, in early August, an admiring veteran presented him with a replica of his Purple Heart and Mr. Trump said, ?I always wanted to get the Purple Heart. This was much easier.? Mr. Trump is saying he wishes that he had joined the armed forces somehow (he had a chance but skimmed out, like so many others of his time) and then had died or been scarred or maimed in combat? This is the dream of a nine-year-old boy, and it impugns the five hundred thousand young Americans who have died in combat in my lifetime, and the many hundreds of thousands more whose lives were altered or shattered by their wounds of war. I take this personally, representing as I do the last sliver of the sixteen million Americans who served in the military in mywar experienced the loss of more than twenty close friends, classmates, and companions of my youth, who remain young and fresh in memory. I have named them in previous pieces, along with some wounded survivors, like my friend Gardner, an infantry captain who landed at Normandy Beach and fought atH Forest and Aachen and the Battle of the Bulge, was twicewounded late brother-in-law Neil, who lay wounded on the field for two days during the battle of Belfort Gap, and who hobbled with a cane all his life, and with two canes near the end. Every American of my generation can supply stories like these, and once learned and tried to forget that, worldwide, seventy million people died in our war. Far too many people have forgotten the lessons of that dreadful conflict ? or never learned them at all, as inTrump case. Trump is a selfish coward at his core; a draft-dodger who then had the nerve to compare his promiscuity with the sacrifices of the hundreds of thousands of young Americans who perished in the jungles of Vietnam, a man who mocks war heroes and insults the families of our slain warriors, a man who uses our veterans for cheap propaganda stunts and tosses them aside oncethey served their purpose. Trump is uniquely ill-suited for the presidency, a man enslaved by his ego and devoid of principle ? negatives that deeply disturb Mr. Angell. ?Mr. Trump is endlessly on record as someone who will not back down, who cannot appear to pause or lose. He is a man who must win, stay on the attack, and who thinks, first and last, ?How will I look?? This is central, and what comes after it, for me, at times, is concern for what it must be like for anyone who, facing an imperative as dark and unforgiving as this, finds only thenarcissist mirror for reassurance.? On the other hand, Mr. Angell has glowing praise for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, a woman who has spent her entire life in public service, who has shown time and time again that she has a backbone of steel and is up to the pressures of the Presidency: I will cast my own vote for Hillary Clinton with alacrity and confidence. From the beginning, her life has been devoted to public service and to improving the lives of children and the disadvantaged. She is intelligent, strong, profoundly informed, and extraordinarily experienced in the challenges and risks of our lurching, restlessly altering world and wholly committed to the global commonality. Her well-established connections to minorities may bring some better understanding of our urban and suburban police crisis. Ms. Clinton will make a strong and resolutePresident last, a female leader of ourown, in the end, perhaps a unifying one. He saves his best criticism for the end, however, as he nervously ponders what a President Trump might be responding to an ordinary day in the White House: ?If Donald Trump wins this election, his nights in the White House will very soon resemble those of President Obama. A new day is arriving, and with it the latest rush of badnews police shooting out West, another suicide bomber in Yemen, and other urgent briefings from a world already caught up in themorning difficult events. He needs to respond, but the beginning of thisPresident response is always reliably at hand: How will I look?? We absolutely cannot elect a President that will put his own public image above the needs of the American people. Read the full article here.

"According to HomelandSecurity Inspector General, at least 858 immigrants from foreign countries that pose national security risks, as well as those from countries with high immigration fraud who had orders to have them deported were mistakenlygranted citizenship. An internal Homeland Security audit was released Monday, which documented the ?mistake.? The Associated Press reports: The report does not identify any of the immigrants by name, but Inspector General JohnRoth auditors said they were all from ?special interest countries? ? those that present a national security concern for the United States ? or neighboring countries with high rates of immigration fraud. The report did not identify those countries. DHS said the findings reflect what has long been a problem for immigration officials ? old paper-based records containing fingerprint information thatcan be searched electronically. DHS says immigration officials are in the process of uploading these files and that officials will review ?every file? identified as a case of possible fraud.Roth report said fingerprints are missing from federal databases for as many as 315,000 immigrants with final deportation orders or who are fugitive criminals. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has not reviewed about 148,000 of those immigrants? files to add fingerprints to the digital record. The gap was created because older, paper records were never added to fingerprint databases created by both the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service and the FBI in the 1990s. ICE, the DHS agency responsible for finding and deporting immigrants living in the country illegally,didn consistently add digital fingerprint records of immigrants whom agents encountered until 2010. And this is what happens when government puts its nose in things like healthcare and other unconstitutional things it usurps its authority to meddle in. If the central government had been focused only on the things it is authorized to deal with, this matter would more than likely never have occurred. Not only that, but you can rest assured that no one will be held accountable in the matter. While DHS is blaming paper issues and fingerprints, there were some of those who were awarded citizenship that were set to be deported. While Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee Michael McCaul called on ICE to have all immigration fingerprints digitized, but the threat to national security is great since citizens can apply and obtain security clearances or take jobs which are security sensitive. According to Roth, at least three of these new citizens acquired aviation or transportation worker credentials, granting them access to secure areas in airports or maritime facilities and vessels. He went on to state that their credentials were revoked once it was discovered that they had been given citizenship mistakenly. He also said that another individual had been given the role of a law enforcement officer. While changes were recommended and DHS agreed with them and said they would work to implement them, this problem has been going on for years. According to the AP report, ?The government has known about the information gap and its impact on naturalization decisions since at least 2008 when a Customs and Border Protection official identified 206 immigrants who used a different name or other biographical information to gain citizenship or other immigration benefits, though few cases have been investigated.?

"Device near New Jersey train station explodes while FBI investigates ELIZABETH, N.J. ? A suspicious device found in a trash can near a train station exploded early Monday as a bomb squad was attempting to disarm it with a robot, officials said. Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage said the FBI was working to disarm one of five devices found in the same bag in a trash can by two men at around 8:30 p.m. Sunday near the Elizabeth train station. The men had reported seeing wires and a pipe coming out of the package, Bollwage said. Story Continued Below There was no immediate report of injuries or damage. The mayor warned that other explosions were expected. FBI agents and police converged on an apartment above a fried chicken restaurant near the train station before 6 a.m. Monday, but it was not clear whether their search of the dwelling was connected to the explosion. New Jersey Transit service trains resumed service on the Northeast Corridor and North Jersey Coast Line at 5:30 a.m. Monday, but they faced residual delays because service was suspended after the devices were found. Amtrak was operating on a modified schedule. Train passengers reported being stuck on Amtrak and NJ Transit trains for hours Sunday night, while some trains moved in reverse to let passengers off at other stations. Amtrak said 2,400 passengers were affected and trains were being brought in to other stations for people to get other transportation. It wasn't clear when the Elizabeth station would be open, a threat to cause major issues on the Monday morning commute into New York. The discovery of the suspicious package came a day after an explosion in Manhattan injured 29 people, and an unexploded pressure-cooker device was found four blocks away in New York City. Also Saturday, a pipe bomb exploded about an hour from the Elizabeth train station in Seaside Park, New Jersey, forcing the cancellation of a military charity 5K run. Officials said it didn't appear that those two incidents were connected, though they weren't ruling anything out. Investigators didn't immediately comment on whether they thought the Elizabeth incident was connected to either of the two blasts. Bollwage said that he wasn't willing to say that Elizabeth had become a target and that it was possible that someone worried about the authorities was trying to get rid of the package. ""I'm extremely concerned for the residents of the community, but more importantly extremely concerned for everyone in the state and country where someone can just go and drop a backpack into a garbage can that has multiple explosives in it,"" Bollwage said.

"NRA warns voters that Clinton will leave them unprotected The National RifleAssociation new spot is aimed at people who are already afraid, and hammers Hillary Clinton for wanting to leave them defenseless. The gun rights group saidit spending $5 million to run the spot on national cable and on regional stations in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio and Virginia. The ad does not mention Donald Trump, who the group endorsed in May. But it does dovetail with messages that both he and the NRA have delivered before, casting Clinton as an elitist who would take away individuals? guns while benefiting from armed protection herself. Story Continued Below The ad, called ?Nightstand,? shows a woman, alone in bed, awakened in the night by an intruder. She dashes for a landline phone, and a gun stored in a safe. But it fades away before she can grab it. A narrator says the average 911 response time is 11 minutes. ?Hillary Clinton would take away her right to self defense, and with Supreme Court justices, Hillary can,? the narrator says. ?Don?t let Hillary leave you protected with nothing but a phone.? Self defense against other people has become the top reason for gun ownership in the United States, according to a new study from Harvard and Northeastern University researchers. About two-thirds listed that reason for owning guns in 2015, The Trace reported, and handgun ownership has risen proportionally compared with rifles.That despite drops in violent crime over recent decades. While Clinton has made tighter gun laws, including universal background checks, a centerpiece of her campaign, she has not said she wants to ban firearms or repeal the Second Amendment. However, the NRA points to comments she made at a fundraiser that the Supreme Court is ?wrong on the Second Amendment,? an apparent reference to a 2008 case that affirmed anindividual right to bear arms. With its latest buy, the NRA has spent more than $11 million to supportTrump candidacy, adding to its status as the biggest outside spender. Thegroup previous spot highlighted that Clinton has armed protection, even as she would restrict it for others. Trump recently seized on this line of argument as well, in a way that some interpreted as inciting violence. Speaking Friday in Miami, Trump called for her bodyguards? the U.S. Secret Service ? to disarm. ?Take their guns away. Shedoesn want guns ?let see what happens to her. Take their guns away, OK?It be very dangerous,? Trump said.

"A Mexican immigration officer holds by his arm a child as he and his mother are deported back to Guatemala | Getty Child migrants lose major case in federal court Child migrants suffered a major setback in the federal courts on Tuesday, but Congress and the White House also found themselves lectured to from the bench for failing to do more to help the juveniles, thousands of whom have been thrown into deportation hearings without defense counsel. At one level, the ruling by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is a clear victory for the Justice Department. It effectively dooms a long-awaited federal district court trial, scheduled to begin in November in Seattle, on thechildren right to counsel. Story Continued Below But at a second level,Justice win had a hollow ring as two of the three judges wrote a concurring opinion that repeatedly invoked the words of former Attorney General Eric Holder that the government has a ?moral obligation? to ensure the presence of counsel for the children. ?What is missing here. Money and resolve ? political solutions that fall outside the purview of the courts,? wrote Judge Margaret McKeown, a Democratic appointee, together with her Republican appointee colleague, Judge Milan Smith. ?The stakes are too high,? they concluded. ?To give meaning to ?Equal Justice Under Law,? the tag line engraved on the U.S. Supreme Court building, to ensure the fair and effective administration of our immigration system, and to protect the interests of children who must struggle through that system, the problem demands action now.? The underlying case arises from a federal lawsuit filed against the government in July 2014 by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. The backdrop was the record number of border crossings that spring and summer by unaccompanied children from Central America. In the ensuing turmoil, the Obama administration responded by ordering the immigration courts to quickly arraign the new arrivals, with or without legal counsel. The accelerated proceedings ? dubbed rocket dockets ? overwhelmed the fragile network of private attorneys typically available to the children. Judges seized the chance to issue removal orders on the spot, and in the first 13 months, nearly 2,800 juveniles ? hundreds of whom were 14 or younger ? received deportation orders after being afforded only a single hearing and no defense counsel. The crisis has since moved out of the headlines, but the total number of removal orders issued for the child migrants since July 2014 had already passed 12,300 by the end of May. These decisions have become a very real threat to the young migrants, especially those who arrived as teenagers and are now 18 or older. Filed in Seattle, the lawsuit landed before U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Zilly, who cautiously tried to define some middle ground that would at least extend added protections for the youngest defendants. When Justice challenged his jurisdictional authority to hear the case, Zilly issued a telltale decision in April 2015 that effectively split the baby. On the narrow statutory grounds, Zilly agreed with the administration. But on the larger constitutional question of thechildren due process rights, Zilly refused to dismiss the lawsuit outright and said the plaintiffs deserved a timely answer. It was this April 2015 decision by Zilly that brought the case to the 9th Circuit, where the administration argued that the district court had overstepped its jurisdiction and any due process claims of the children were subject to the limits imposed by Congress. ?Whatever Congress provides them, is their due process,? a Justice attorney told the court bluntly in one exchange when the case was argued in July. That did not sit well with the panel, but at the same time, the judges faulted the plaintiffs trying to go around the narrow legal path set out by Congress for any such appeals. It is this legal path ? governing deportation appeals ? that is at the nub of the jurisdictional fight. As set out in statute, all such deportation appeals must first go to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which is part of the same immigration court system that has dealt so harshly with the children. Only after exhausting this remedy can a defendant next file a petition for review and get a hearing with the respective federal appeals court for his or her circuit. Advocates for the children argue that this poses a Catch-22 in that no child without an attorney can be expected to navigate such a complicated appeals process. The system becomes punitive, they say, and effectively denies due process, requiring the courts to intervene. In truth, Zilly, appointed to the federal bench by former President Ronald Reagan, has struggled openly with the very same legal dilemma from the outset of the lawsuit two years ago. He ultimately felt that the constitutional due process question had sufficient weight to demand a timely court hearing and allow him to move ahead for at least the youngest children. Time and again, he showed a special concern for those under 14 years old. So much so that in a recent filing, the plaintiffs argued for a summary judgment at least for this subclassof child migrants. The appeals panel clearly shared some of that concern but wanted a tidier path to get to an answer and around the federal statutes. Having failed to find one,Tuesday ruling wipes out what has been years of work by child advocates trying to get a court hearing on the right-to-counsel issue. ?The 9th Circuit today held that the courthouse doors are effectively closed to thousands of children whose only opportunity to seek appointed counsel in their immigration proceedings is through this case,? said Ahilan Arulanantham, who has been theACLU lead counsel on the case. ?The court issued that ruling even as it simultaneously recognized that virtually all children cannot represent themselves in immigration proceedings.? ?We disagree with this decision, and will continue the fight to ensure that the claims of these children to appointed counsel receive their day in court. In light of the 9thCircuit recognition of the moral imperative at stake, we again call on the Obama administration to exercise its power to cease its unjust practice of requiring children to represent themselves in immigration court.? Matt Adams, who has taken the lead in the case for the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, was scathing in his frustration with thecourt ruling. ?The court determined that a theoretical possibility for judicial review suffices even where as a practical matter, the thousands of unrepresented children will be ordered deported without ever having an opportunity to argue that they are need an attorney to get a fair hearing,? Adams said. ?The court points to one case of an unrepresented child back in 2004 that reached its doors. ... But if there is only one case in 15 years, with thousands of other children who have been deported, this only demonstrates there is no meaningful opportunity.? Justice had no immediate public comment, but privately officials signaled little joy with the win. Indeed, the harsh treatment of the children in 2014 and 2015 remains a genuine embarrassment for the White House. Draft rules are under consideration to create a more uniform system nationally, under which immigration judges would give children more time to find lawyers. And before the president leaves office next year, there is pressure to have these completed and in place.",0.015911873,0.0,0.008567930999999999,0.009791922,0.05630355,0.334149327,0.00244798,2,-1,1

"Story highlights Hillary Clinton continues to lead Donald Trump in almost every poll out of New Hampshire This survey finds a wider lead for her than a NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll (CNN) Hillary Clinton continues to lead in New Hampshire, according to the latest survey from Monmouth University released Wednesday. The poll showed 47% of likely voters in the state backing Clinton, compared with 38% who support Donald Trump. Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson has 10% support, according to Monmouth. Clinton has led Trump in almost every poll out of New Hampshire, and a Republican has not carried the state since George W. Bush won there in 2000.

" Famed economist and former labor secretary Robert Reich posted an interaction he recently had with a Trump supporter that demonstrates just how deeply this ridiculous misconception that Donald Trump is a ?good businessman? has sunk into the public consciousness. Businessmen only care about one thing ? their profits, and increasing those profits. A nation-state is not a business, nor should it be run like one. The leader of a nation-state must care for the well-being of his people and balancing complex international relationships with other nation-states, concerns thatdon have anything to do with the single-minded obsession with profit. And of course, Trump is not a good businessman. He started out with a ?small loan? of just a million dollars after being handed all the opportunities a straight white male needs to make it in America. He then lied, cheated and extorted his way to the top, and still managed to rack up four bankruptcies and over 3500 lawsuits. He is nothing but a con-man, andhe about to run our country into the ground just likehe done to his businesses.

"Story highlights ""We should ask for federal protection,"" Lewis said Lewis was badly injured in 1965 while marching for voting rights Washington (CNN) Rep. John Lewis, a pioneer in the civil rights movement, wants the Obama administration to appoint observers for the November election in certain states. ""We should ask for federal protection,"" the Georgia Democrat said Wednesday, warning ""the election can be stolen on election day at polling places."" Lewis, who was badly injured in 1965 while marching in Selma, Alabama for voting rights for African-Americans, said several states including Georgia, Florida, Ohio and North Carolina should be monitored, and potentially all of the states that belonged to the confederacy. Lewis made his comments at a roundtable on voting rights with other Democrats and advocacy groups held in the room in the Capitol named after President Lyndon Baines Johnson, who signed the landmark voting right law. In August, the Supreme Court denied a request from North Carolina to allow provisions of its controversial voting rights law to go back into effect.

"United Nations  President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis ""of epic proportions,"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence. The President's interest in calling attention to the tens of millions of displaced people around the world, and pushing back against the anti-refugee tenor, was underscored by his decision to convene a Leaders' Summit on Refugees at the United Nations Tuesday. At the summit, he also rejected another aspect of the American political debate swirling around accepting foreigners -- GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump's call to build a wall along the US-Mexico border. ""This crisis is a test of our common humanity. Whether we give into suspicion and fear and build walls, or whether we see ourselves in another,"" Obama said, though he didn't mention Trump by name. Obama singled out the situation in Syria, which has displaced 4.8 million people so far, as particularly ""unacceptable."" JUST WATCHED President Obama at the UN: Then and now Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH President Obama at the UN: Then and now 01:45 ""We are not as unified as we should be in pushing to make it stop,"" he said, describing the global refugee crisis as both a humanitarian and security challenge that tests countries' ability to take collective action. ""I called this summit because this crisis is one of the most urgent tests of our time,"" he said. ""Just as failure to act in the past -- for example, by turning away Jews fleeing Nazi Germany -- is a stain on our collective conscience, I believe history will judge us harshly if we do not rise to this moment."" The refugee issue is one that's captured the world's attention more in the past two years than at perhaps any time since World War II, seared into the public's consciousness by photos like that of a 3-year-old Syrian boy who drowned in the Mediterranean and the flood of migrants into Europe. A recent study by from the UN's refugee agency estimated 65.3 million people were displaced from their homes by conflict or persecution in 2015, up by over five million from the prior year. Many are internally displaced within the borders of their own countries, but about 21.3 million are classified as refugees. Obama's summit follows a similar UN-led meeting on the issue Monday, which drew attention to the crisis but offered little in the way of binding commitments. ""Make no mistake,"" US Secretary of State John Kerry said at the UN meeting, ""additional efforts are urgently needed."" Leaders also called for a more orderly and equitable system to manage refugee flows -- acknowledging the burden is shouldered disproportionally by certain regions. ""You have to know that today the European Union has a clear objective to restore order on its external borders,"" European Council President Donald Tusk said in his remarks, signaling a growing sense that patience in Europe with the migrant flow is wearing thin. ""There will be no repeat of the year 2015 with more than one and a half million irregular migrants,"" he added. The Obama administration is hopeful the Leader's Summit on Tuesday afternoon can build momentum for more action. National Security Advisor Susan Rice in June announced that the gathering -- co-hosted along with the US by Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, Jordan, Mexico, Sweden and the UN Secretary General -- would seek an increase in funding of at least 30%, a doubling of permanent resettlement, and expanded access to education and work rights for refugees. ""Reaching these ambitious objectives will be challenging, yet the level of need demands no less,"" Rice said in a statement. But aid groups are skeptical the summit will prompt the kind of action they say is desperately needed. ""We have to be optimistic that we'll see some real concrete commitments,"" said Amnesty International's Interim Executive Director Margaret Huang. ""But the truth is, even if those numbers are hit, it's nowhere near what's actually needed."" The US is a major contributor of humanitarian aid for countries that host large numbers of refugees -- particularly Syria's neighbors -- and plans to increase the number of refugees it will take in to America from 85,000 in 2016 to 110,000 next year. The President's chief spokesman last week conceded that even as the administration calls for greater global action, it is limited in what it can do. ""The President's commitment to ensuring that the United States plays a leading role on this issue is not shared by a lot of people in Congress, including by a lot of people in the Republican majority in Congress,"" Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. ""And that has an impact in terms of the resources that are dedicated to this effort."" Vetting efforts to screen refugees, he noted, ""are not cheap."" David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee and a former British Foreign Secretary, said he's hopeful but waiting to see whether any agreements are backed up with action. ""The scale of the global refugee problem demands an appropriate scale of response,"" Miliband told CNN. ""Governments around the world haven't, in the main, been responding with the right degree of compassion or competence up to now."" But the co-hosts of the Leaders' Summit said in a statement they were pleased with ""new and significant humanitarian contributions"" from world leaders. ""We sought a $3 billion increase in global humanitarian financing and commitments to maintain funding in future years,"" they said. ""Through our mutual efforts, over the course of 2016, the 32 donors participating today have contributed this year roughly 4.5 billion additional dollars to UN appeals and international humanitarian organizations than in 2015."" As they await action from world leaders in New York, a group of volunteers in London laid out a ""life jacket graveyard"" Monday to draw attention to the plight of thousands of migrants who've lost their lives attempting hazardous boat crossings in the Mediterranean. The conflict in Syria and resulting migrant crisis in the Middle East and Europe have dominated headlines over the past 18 months, but refugees are a global problem. Perhaps nowhere are they more prevalent than in the so-called ""global south"" -- the developing countries of the southern hemisphere. Last week, South Sudan joined the ranks of Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia -- countries with over 1 million of their citizens living as refugees abroad. And protracted conflict in places like Somalia have led to a generation of lifelong refugees -- men and women in their twenties who've never known life outside of a camp. ""These are not people who can envision what life would be like if they were returned to their home countries,"" Huang said.",0.027060271,0.007380074,0.001230012,0.0061500619999999995,0.046740467,0.27798278,0.001230012,2,-1,1
"As opponents of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement look to prevent Congress from voting on the deal in the lame-duck session later this year, they have increasingly focused on one controversial section of the pact to make their case: the investor state dispute settlement system, or ISDS. ISDS allows foreign investors to sue host countries over regulations that affect their businesses. The cases are heard outside national courts by ad hoc tribunals that are empowered to award taxpayer-funded compensation. On the right, critics like Donald Trump claim the TPP would ""give up congressional power"" and cost America its ""economic independence."" Left-wing critics like Bernie Sanders are equally dour, claiming the pact ""undermines our sovereignty and subverts democratically passed laws including those dealing with labor, health and the environment."" Trump and Sanders overstate the novelty of this part of the TPP. ISDS has been included in thousands of pacts, including dozens involving TPP countries, most of which allow investors to pick the most favorable rules in a host state's treaty network. TPP didn't create the system, and rejecting it won't end it. But the critics have cause for concern. ISDS, as currently designed, allows investors to launch billion-dollar claims against governments for sometimes little more than making good on campaign pledges to their citizens. From Egypt to El Salvador, BuzzFeed's Chris Hamby reports, investors have invoked ISDS threats to obtain sweetheart settlements from governments. Some of those deals have put severe strain on national budgets. ""Shadow Courts,"" a new book by Time magazine's Haley Edwards, shows how ISDS threats have strained support for free trade around the world. Fixing ISDS should be a high priority for the next administration. In fact, such a fix would require just a few sentences of legislation to rein in the worst abuses of the system while upholding investor rights. In 1990, now-TPP advocates Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) helped enact the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act. This legislation allowed would-be legal disputes between American citizens and U.S. government agencies to be routed into binding arbitration. To address constitutionality concerns, a vital safeguard was built into the mix: third parties could appeal to U.S. courts to overturn an arbitration award if broader social interests were at risk. That legislation provided a template for my proposal to fix ISDS, which I presented at the American Political Science Association meetings earlier this month in Philadelphia. It leverages a little-appreciated aspect of the investment rules. Unlike weaker areas of international law, ISDS awards are enforced ultimately in national courts. Under current Supreme Court precedent, U.S. judges are instructed to defer to arbitral decisions. In other words, if a country loses a case in arbitration, it cannot appeal to national judges to overturn that decision because it was wrong or shortsighted. Under my proposal, thiswouldn be the case. I proffer a so-called Equitable Investment Act. Just a few sentences long, this would give third parties a new right to petition U.S. courts to vacate arbitration awards that affect broader social interests. Here's how it would work in practice: Say a French bank sues Argentina under a bilateral Franco-Argentine treaty, alleging that a new Argentine administration's signature financial regulation plan cut into profits more than under a previous lighter-touch regime. Under the current ISDS system, the company could sue Argentina under the ISDS system and benefit from thepossibilityremote arbitrators would side with it and order cash payment. And under current federal arbitration laws, the bank would enjoy the near certainty that national courts would help enforce theaward no review of the policy merits of the underlying claim. Under the Equitable Investment Act, in contrast, a U.S. court would be empowered to set aside the arbitrators' award if Argentine consumer groups showed it would harm their interests in a stable financial system back home. The legislation would presume that the U.S. has jurisdiction to review the award. While innovative, the proposal builds on existing practice. Already, U.S. courts can be asked to help attach Argentina's U.S. assets in such a dispute with French investors. The reform would simply expand their mandate and move up the timing of their involvement. Even if Argentine activists never used these rights, the possibility that they could would deter investors from challenging popular public interest policies. My proposal is doable in the first 100 days, even without a shift in the composition of Congress. Already, both parties have critiqued ISDS. Moreover, in a separate scuffle, a bipartisan coalition is poised to override President Obama's veto of a bill shredding the sovereign immunity in U.S. courts of foreign states linked to terrorism. With this standoff, legislators have shown themselves willing to strain diplomatic ties and risk loss of foreign sovereigns' investment in the U.S. In comparison, the relatively modest Equitable Investment Act would incentivize that money to return, as sovereigns facing overreaching ISDS claims would enjoy new protections for their assets. The impasse over ISDS points to a bigger problem: We lack a global governance system for investment that is coherent and fair enough to command popular support. Hillary Clinton has pledged to invent a ""new paradigm"" on investor-state dispute resolution, and Trump advisers have also called for change. But both Clinton and Trump are short on policy details. In the short term, they should take up this proposal. But in the long term, my stopgap measure will not be enough. New treaty rules are needed to put global governance on a more sustainable footing. Among other things, investors will be eager to move toward a system in which treaty outcomes are more certain. As part of a one-two punch with the changes to domestic arbitration law, the next administration should propose a global Equitable Investment Convention and call on other countries to sign up. My convention proposal would separate investor gripes into two tracks, which would better mirror our national laws' balance of property rights and democratic decision-making. First, states that expropriate property will have to compensate investors promptly and fairly. Instead of ISDS legal proceedings that take years to resolve and often deliver only pennies on investors' claims, teams of accountants would work to precisely tally the value of what investors sunk into their projects. States would then get a bill, which they could pay or challenge in a fast-tracked arbitration. Alternatively, if a state harmed an investor in less severe ways, arbitrators could still rule on whether and how the government fell short of its obligations. But unlike the current system, arbitrators would produce an advisory decision in six months. This document would not only find faults, but recommend specific reforms governments could make to come into compliance. States would accept or reject the advice, but they would be required to explain their choice and make all of the correspondence public. Most important, the Convention would fix ISDS' double standard. Instead of foreign investors enjoying rights that domestic investors, unions and environmental groups don't, the pact would level the playing field. Just as an investor can now ask a tribunal to determine whether capital controls violate a state's obligations, a union would be able to request a second opinion on collective bargaining rights. An environmental NGO could shine a spotlight on weak carbon emissions plans. And domestic investors could complain about preferential treatment received by wealthy foreign companies. These rulings will allow citizens to name and shame bad governments without compromising sovereignty. This proposal would accomplish what neither side of the TPP debate has promised: a path toward systemic reform of the over 3,000 ISDS pacts that already exist. Countries that joined the Convention would spare their investors from being dragged into U.S. courts under the Act. For any two countries that joined the Convention, their past deals would be automaticallysuperseded time-consuming country-by-country negotiations. In a global economy, international and domestic law can check and improve each other. From trade wars to climate change to tax avoidance, we need to ensure that countries don't solve their problems at eachother expense. International rules have a role to play, and independent adjudicators can be referees when the rules are in doubt. But the dialogue needs to be moredynamic arbitrators, to states, to the public, andback it's going to lead to better and more legitimate governance.

Interested in Barack Obama? Add Barack Obama as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Barack Obama news, video, and analysis from ABC News.

Obama further cautioning against ""the same forces of global integration"" that have made democracies interdependent while exposing ""deep fault lines in the existing international order"" like gaps between the rich and poor created by capitalism throughout the world. He made two other references to the ineffectiveness of walls in stopping global forces, quipping in an apparent reference to the Zika virus that ""mosquitoes don't respect walls"" and saying of terrorism that ""the world is simply too small to be able to build a wall and stop it from affecting our own societies."" Though he never directly addressed the U.S. presidential election, Obama's message for the General Assembly was in many ways applicable to the impulses raging in the race, citing ""a contest between authoritarianism and democracy right now"" and an appeal for a top-down ""strongman model."" Obama rejected such tendencies. ""History shows that strongmen are then left with two paths,"" he said. ""Permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies abroad, which can lead to war."" Speaking about the big picture, the Obama recounted the progress made during his presidency, on issues such as the global financial crisis, international terrorism and re-establishing relations with Cuba. ""This is important work,"" he stressed. ""It has made a real difference in the lives of our people, and it could not have happened had we not worked together."" Obama said nations ""can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration"" or ""retreat into a world sharply divided and ultimately in conflict along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion."" ""I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward and not backward,"" he said, although he added that doing so would require nations of the world to ""acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction."" ""The answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration,"" Obama said. ""Instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such integration are broadly shared and that the disruptions ? economic, political and cultural ? that are caused by integration are squarely addressed."" Obama demanded that democracies of the world ""speak out forcefully"" for ""freedom and dignity."" ""A world in which 1 percent of the economy controls the other 99 percent will never be stable,"" he said. ""These are the policies I've pursued in the United States, and with clear results"" ? touting progress in job creation, cutting poverty, improving infrastructure and investing in childhood education. His speech came as fighting in Syria has resumed after the Syrian military declared Monday an end to the fragile cease-fire deal that was brokered between the U.S. and Russia just over a week ago. ""Together now we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home. We should all welcome the pledges of increased assistance that have been made at this General Assembly gathering,"" Obama said. ""There's a lot of nations right now that are doing the right thing, but many nations ? particularly those blessed with wealth and the benefits of geography ? that can do more to offer a hand."" In the same month that North Korea conducted its second nuclear test of the year, Obama highlighted the benefits of free markets over markets resisting influence from globalization. ""We cannot unwind integration any more than we can stuff technology back into a box, nor can we look to failed models of the past. If we start resorting to trade wars, market distorting subsidies, overreliance on national resources instead of innovation, these approaches will make us poor collectively, and they're more likely to lead to conflict,"" he said.

"As my 25th wedding anniversary approached, I tried to be creative in buying gifts for my wife. I had the idea of a silver coin that marked 25 years of something or other. I went to a local coin shop, and as I idled over some of the display cases, I noticed a set of coins from the mid-19th century. Oddly, the coins from the 1840s and 1850s werelarge until 1857, when the coins started becoming, at best, half the size of the others. ?Oh, the Panic of 1857,? the owner said when I asked him about the change of size. ?It was really bad. The presidentdidn seem to have any solution except to use less gold or silver in the coins.? Story Continued Below Now that is inept presidential decision-making. During the current election campaign, there has been a lot of gnashing of teeth over the possibilitythat the winneris or she will be so terrible as a leader they will bring down the republic as the worst president since independence. And before the current candidates were known, the two most recent White House occupants, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, have been consistently reviled by their detractors as the worst men to lead the country. But Obama and Bush can both take heart. And Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton can gain solace, perhaps, from knowing that no matter how badly they do, they almost certainlywon rank last. By my reckoning, that place belongs to James Buchanan, genial a man though he was.I made quite a study of him. My innocent encounter at the coin shop only reinforced my lifelong determination to take an offbeat look at,let say, the lesser presidents. My father was definitely the only one in our suburban neighborhood with a biography of Franklin Pierce. Everywhere we went, he forced me to read historicalplaques the car in a shrieking halt at times to view them. If I were to write a book about a president, it surelywouldn be about Washington or Lincoln, or even Silent Cal Coolidge. It would have to be about someone as ineffectual as possible. Buchanan, the only president from my native state, Pennsylvania, turned out to be my man. Start with his anemic, minimalist solution to one ofAmerica great financial downturns. For a long time before Buchanan, in effect, precipitated the Panic of 1857, things were going well for the country, at least in an economic sense. There had been a bad downturn 20 years before, with multiple causes, like war in Europe, the dissolution of the Bank of the United States, and overspeculation in, oddly enough, slaves and Western land. The great acquisition of land under President James Knox Polk, from Oregon to California to Texas, reinvigorated the economy, and a boom lasted for the next two decades. Railroads were the big player, since so many people wanted to move West into the new territories and states. Manufacturing boomed domestically, and then with foreign trade as well, since Europe had quelled many of its hostilities and American items were cheaper than those on the Continent. Then the day before Buchanan took office, Congress passed what he wanted, the Tariff Bill of 1857, which lowered tariffs on a panoply of items fromabroad wanted to stimulate foreigntrade made American manufactured goods of the same sort less competitive. Three days later came the real fatal blow, though, the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, which fell on the shoulders of Buchanan. The case had wound through state and federal courts for at least a decade, but Roger Taney, the Supreme Court chief justice, and a fellow alumnus, with Buchanan, of small Dickinson College, wanted it settled. Scott was a slave to a military man who at times was stationed not in his native Missouri, a slave state, but in the Northwest Territories, which were nonslave. After his master died, Scott brought the case that he should be free because he had lived in nonslave territory. Buchanan wanted to be a hero, and thought if the case could be decided broadly, it could settle the question of slavery in the Union for good. Buchanan knew, too, though, that the court had five Southerners and four Northerners, and if the decision were split that way, it would be ineffective. He and Taney had apparently agreed to have a narrower decision, or remand the case back to the Appeals Court, if it were merely sectional, since they felt the need to have some sort of bipartisanship for the decision to be legitimate. Ignoring the idea of separation of powers, though, Buchanan browbeat Robert Cooper Grier, another Dickinson alumnus and a justice from Pennsylvania, to go along with the majority opinion, which Taney would write. Eventually, a New York native, Justice Samuel Nelson, wrote a concurring opinion, making the vote even less sectional. Legend has it that Taney, on the Capitol stairs just before he gave Buchanan the oath of office at the inauguration, told Buchanan that the decision would become public in the next few days. Buchanan apparently changed his speech to indicatethat that he would be all for whatever the court decided. Two days later, the decision came down. Taney castigated Scott, whom he said was not a citizen, being a slave, and thus could not bring any suit. He also wrote that the Constitution gave no state or territory the power to institute or, conversely, prohibit slavery. Thus all the compromises about it, going back to the 1820s, were invalid, and, in fact, the Fugitive Slave Law, requiring anyone who knew about it to return slaves to their owners anywhere in the country, was in force. Historically, experts rate Dred Scott as the worst decision in thecourt history, but short of that, it was at the very least transformational for thecountry not just Taney, but surely Buchanan, responsible for it. As appalled as most of the country was about the morals of the decision at the time, there was a practical downside, too. Now no one knew whether he or she wanted to go West, to use the railroads, or to start a business that railroads might profit from. Railroad stocks started to decline in value, and then a contagion hit, and it was free fall. By midsummer, no one could take a ride on the Reading, as Uncle Pennybags does in the Monopoly game, since the Reading Railroad had shut down, as did lines now and then famous like the Illinois Central. Several lines, like the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western and the Fond du Lac Railroad in Wisconsin, declared bankruptcy. Thousands were thrown out of work, and banks started foreclosing on loans and property. Senator William Seward, the leader of the new Republican Party, come home from a vacation to find out he had lost most everything heowned stock in the Illinois Central, promoted to him by his rival Democrat Stephen Douglas, was virtually worthless. Every bank in New York City effectivelyclosed would convert coins or gold into bank notes. The oldest grain company in New York, N.H. Wolfe and Co., failed in August, as did the most prominent insurance business in the country, the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Co. Buchanan and his administration did nothing to stem the public hysteria. Calm words might have quelled it, but his inaction only made for further runs on banks and, thus, more turmoil in markets. The residue that mattered most, though, was the reaction caused by Dred Scott. Instead of promoting unity and opening up the West to more settlement, as Buchanan had thought, Dred Scott thwarted it, and brought an end to years of Northern prosperity. Yet the South did not succumb as badly. Its agrarian culture was self-sustaining, and its cotton still had a market in Europe. There was a surge in arms sales there as well, the economic downturn in the North exacerbating regional tensions. The relative good times in the South caused Northerners of all parties to further blame Buchanan for being a Southern lackey.Buchanan response was underwhelming, almost disdainful. He said the federal government could do nothing. In his Annual Message in December 1857, he said he sympathized with the travails caused by the Panic, but he would do nothing for individual suffering. The government would continue to pay its obligations and would keep going on whatever public works projects it had started, but would begin no new ones. He said too many people had speculated in land and slaves and the like and ?deserved thegambler fate.? Eventually, he noted, the youth and energy of the rugged American individuals would triumph, though there would clearly be an interim of rough times. In a sense, he was right, because it took the rugged young Americans who went to war in 1861 to bring the economy back. Throughout his term, when a fork appeared in the road, Buchanan managed to take the wrong turn. When hostilities flared in Kansas, over whether that territory would enter as a slave or free state, Buchanan wavered over which of two proposed constitutions would be valid, exacerbating the killings, some done by the wild-eyed anti-slavery radical John Brown. When later Brown seized arms with a small cadre of followers in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, just 40 miles from Washington along the Potomac, Buchanan again diddled before consulting Robert E. Lee, who had fortuitously been home in Arlington on leave from his post in Texas. Lee quickly went to Harpers Ferry to capture Brown and quell the raid. In other ventures, though, Buchanan dashed troops out on strange and unproductive missions. He caused chaos in Utah, quelling what he thought to be a Mormon revolt, causing villages to be burned to the ground and dozens of lives lost over what was merely a jurisdictional dispute. He supported mercenary WilliamWalker forays to conquer Nicaragua and Guatemala, and sent troops to try to annex parts of Paraguay, primarily to acquiesce to his Southern base that wanted more slave states to come into the union. Then there was the little known Pig War, started when a settler along the Canadian border on the San Juan straits in the Northwest, shot a pig owned by the Hudson Bay Co. that wandered onto his property. A standoff ensued until Buchanan sent troops otherwise guarding Kansas, where there was a real problem, out to calm thenonfatal to onepig. This was at a time when there were about only 12,000 soldiers in the U.S. Army, stretched as thin as could be. As the election of 1860 came close, Buchanan refused to support the one Democrat who could win, Stephen Douglas, because he just plaindidn like him. That caused the party to split into three factions, each nominating a candidate, virtually ensuring Republican Abraham Lincoln the election. The Southern states, which had threatened secession, started doing so during the interim betweenLincoln election and his inauguration in March, thus underBuchanan watch. Buchanan took the unusual position that the Constitution did not allow secession, but the president could not do anything to prevent it. As the first half-dozen states seceded, Buchanan lost several Cabinetmembers had a lot of Southernallies refused entreaties by many, including former President John Tyler, who would himself become a Confederate congressman, to find compromises to bring the wastrel states back into the fold. Meanwhile, Buchanan allowed the seizure of armaments and forts by the seceding states and suggested the abandonment of the one major fortified island in the South, Fort Sumter. Enter Lincoln, who has long been rated in serious surveys and schoolmarms? speeches as the greatest of presidents. Lincoln no doubt was a man with plans and savvy, but I contend that the bar was set so low by his predecessor that maybe if there were no James Buchanan, the ?Worst. President. Ever,? there would have been a few notches more on the presidential-rating scale for Abe Lincoln to climb. Today, George W. Bush is often rated one of the worst presidents in history, thanks to his authorship of the Iraq War and his presiding over the Crash of ?08 and the beginning of the Great Recession. Obama is sometimes seen in the same light, especially by the far right. But as happened with Honest Abe and his predecessor, perhaps that low bar will only make it easier for a President Hillary Clinton or a President Donald Trump to shine.

"Lester Holt, who anchors ""NBC Nightly News,"" will be the moderatorfor the first debate. | Getty Everything you need to know about Trump andClinton first 2016 presidential debate When is the first general election presidential debate? The first general election presidential debate of 2016 will be held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York on Sept. 26. Story Continued Below What time is the debate and how long is it? The debate will start at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time and run for 90 minutes without commercial breaks. How can I watch the debate? It will be broadcast on all of the major television networks, as well as the websites for major cable news channels and C-SPAN. Who will participate in the debate? Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and celebrity real estate mogul Donald Trump. No other candidates qualified. Who will moderate the debate? Lester Holt, who anchors ""NBC Nightly News,"" will be the moderator.It his second time serving in that role in the 2016 presidential cycle. Holt was also a moderator for the Democratic primary debate on January 17. On February 15, 2015 Holt became the substitute anchor of NBC Nightly News after Brian Williams was suspended. Four months later he became the permanent anchor. What is the format of the debate? The debate will be divided into six segments of 15 minutes each. Each segment will start with a question from Holt, after which each candidates will have two minutes for an initial response and then will be allowed to respond to each other. On Monday, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced the tentative topics for the debate: ?America's direction,? ?achieving prosperity,? and ?securing America.? The topics are subject to change based on news developments, according to the commission. Why aren't Jill Stein or Gary Johnson participating in the debate? Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein were not invited by the presidential debate commission. The commission said it would only invite candidates that averaged 15 percent in five national polls it selected. Neither Johnson nor Stein made that threshold. What's at stake for Hillary Clinton? The debate isClinton chance to turn the page on a few weeks during which Trump has eaten much of the polling lead she built following her convention.Clinton camp has also been counting on her policy knowledge and debate experience to help her exposeTrump weaknesses, but the Democratic candidate also comes in facing higher expectations than Trump. What's at stake for Donald Trump? Trump has been accused lacking policy gravitas and self-restraint, and both of those perceived weaknesses could be exposed in a debate, where candidates will be grilled on their familiarity with issues foreign and domestic and be expected to keep composed under rhetorical assault from their opponents. Trump has the advantage, however, of low expectations: At several turns in the presidential campaign, even modest pivots away from his bombastic primary style were hailed as pivots to professionalism, and a similar self-restraint ? provided he still hits the high notes his supporters are expected ? could help him clear the low bar again. What is the most watched debate in presidential history? In 1980 the debate between President Jimmy Carter and Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan garnered a viewership of 80.6 million people, the largest television audience for a debate since Nielsen Ratings began collecting viewership data in 1976. In 2012, the first general election presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney attracted about 70 million viewers. What's the most-watched television moment of all time? Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 on NBC is currently the most watched television program in U.S. history, attracting 114 million viewers, according to NBC News. The New England Patriots played against the Seattle Seahawks, winning the game 28-24. Still, that pales in comparison to the estimated 600 million people worldwide who watched Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin make the first moon landing on July 20, 1969, or the estimated 750 million people worldwide that watched Prince Charles of Wales marry Lady Diana Spencer on July 29, 1981.",0.013806706,0.0039447729999999995,0.0039447729999999995,0.00591716,0.019723866,0.203155819,0.0,2,-1,1
"In total, 37 states and the District of Columbia will allow early voting in 2016. | AP Photo When does early voting start in every state? Voting has already started in a scattering of locations, and entire states will be able to vote starting Friday. Election Day is more than a month away, but voters are already casting ballots to pick their next president. Voting opened on Monday in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, making the town's voters among the first in the nation to do so. So far, voting is limited to a smattering of counties and municipalities in states that allow local governments to set their own schedules. On Friday, however, voters statewide in South Dakota and Minnesota will be allowed to cast early ballots. And other states are joining soon: New Jersey starts early voting on Saturday, and Vermont plans to start early voting as soon as the ballots are ready. (State rules say no later than Saturday.) Story Continued Below In total, 37 states and the District of Columbia will allow early voting in 2016. Some of those states allow voters to request mail ballots and send them in, while others open physical polling places weeks or even months before the election. In the 2012 presidential election, approximately 30 percent of the votes cast came via mail or early balloting, meaning many voters will weigh in before the candidates have had a chance to make their closing case. Typically, Democrats lead in early voting, especially in-person early voting, because their voters are not as likely to go out to the polls as Republicans, said Michael McDonald, an election expert and associate professor at the University of Florida. The GOP, however, tends to make up ground through mail in absentee ballots, McDonald said.Here when early voting begins in each state. (Note, the below dates represent the earliest date that voters statewide can send for a ballot or vote in person without a special exemption.) Alabama ?There no universal early voting in Alabama, as voters need a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. Alaska ? Oct. 24. Arizona ? Oct. 12.

"Bullets and bodies were flying in Vegas the night of the worst American mass shooting. Blood everywhere. A hotel room with a dead shooter. Two broken windows. Anarmory worth of weapons. A Saudi Crown Prince upstairs. A girlfriend who flew the coup. Nothing adds up to give anyone answers about that horrible shooting in Las Vegas that pinned Stephen Paddock as the lone-wolf shooter responsible for hundreds of deaths and injuries. A mass shooting so bad that one must wonder how one person was able to take out so many unsuspecting concert goers. It makes you wonder if there was more than one shooter. What about that security guard who went missing? What about the rumors that people shot at a tower hoping for an explosion? Was Stephen Paddock the shooter at all? Was his girlfriend Marilou Danley involved? Was she running around outside warning people about something? New evidence leaks from Vegas that has possible crucial information that might lead to more answers the public so desperately seeks. Authorities identified her fingerprints on the ammunition, and her casino card was in the hotel room. That leads people to wonder about her involvement in the crime. Was she ever in that dreaded hotel room? Was the ammo handled at another location? Did Paddock bring her card to throw her under the bus? What part did Danley play in the atrocious shooting? Or was she a patsy? Was Paddock a patsy? Half of the victims of the Las Vegas shooting were not given an autopsy. Why? Trajectory. Number of bullet wounds. Apparently our dead lone shooter Paddock had an over 80% headshot rate. Manliker Carcano No marksman has ever reenacted Dealey successfully with one. ? Bill Chapman Fmr Film Biz Now Truth Seeker (@bchapman151) January 12, 2018 Some investigators crawled throughDanley social media and email accounts. Stephen Paddock reportedly had access to at least one of the accounts in question. More information comes out and maybe one day we can piece this horrible puzzle together. LA Times reports: ?Marilou Danley may not have been present when Paddock unleashed a furious barrage of bullets down on a crowd of 20,000 at a Las Vegas country music festival, killing 58 people and wounding more than 500 others, but her links to his life seemed to be everywhere. The facts about Danley were among the details revealed when a U.S. District Court judge in Las Vegas unsealed more than 300 pages of search warrants and affidavits at the request of several media outlets, including the Los Angeles Times. The request was unopposed by prosecutors. But why the 64-year-old Paddock shot up the Route 91 Harvest festival on Oct. 1 remains a mystery, and the search warrants ? despite revealing his large cache of weaponry ? raise more questions than answers about his actions and motive. Paddock came to Las Vegas with an arsenal ? more than 20 firearms and hundreds of rounds of ammunition and spent casings were found in his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino. Other search warrants revealed more than 1,000 rounds and 100 pounds of explosive material in his car. Authorities also recovered 18 firearms and more than 1,000 rounds atPaddock house in Mesquite, Nev. A ?large quantity of firearms? was recovered from another residence he had in Reno. The search warrants also covered electronic accounts and social media accounts of Paddock and Danley. They revealed an exchange about a money wire transfer. Danley returned from a trip to the Philippines days after the shooting, butwasn arrested when she arrived in the United States. According to an affidavit, Danley was identified early on ?as the most likely person who aided or abetted Stephen Paddock based on her informing law enforcement that her fingerprints would likely be found on the ammunition used during the attack.? In the court documents, she told investigators she occasionally participated in the loading of the magazines.? Danley loaded magazines on weapons that may have been responsible for a mass amount of bloodshed. Authorities have not arrested her yet, but Danley is a person of interest. My theory is that the authorities are keeping a watchful eye on her to see what she does, who she talks to, and if any of her activity leads people to a much more significant arrest. What was Paddock doing with all those guns in one location? Hecan possibly shoot them all at once, nor would he survive a gunfight with police long enough to use all the ammunition. What were the weapons really for? What wasPaddock real story? Was he a gun runner on a deal that went bad? Was he shot before the shooting started? What happened during that concert in Vegas that set the stage for the horrible shooting?

"3910 SHARES Facebook Twitter Reddit Stumbleupon Pinterest Supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump were not pleased when Rina Shah appeared on Fox News for Independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin last Friday, September 16, 2016. And one of them left a hateful, racist voice mail for her atMcMullin campaign office. Ms. Shah and the McMullin campaign turned this awful-tasting lemon into lemonade ? in the form of a campaign ad.Who McMullin? Evan McMullin was a Republican. At the beginning of August, he announced his Independent candidacy for president as an alternative to Republican nominee Donald Trump. Rina Shah is a political and media consultant who joinedMcMullin campaign staff as Communications Director in mid-August 2016. Shah was born in West Virginia to Indian American parents. She has been a commentator on the PBS program ?To the Contrary? and she founded Rilax Strategies, a political consulting firm. Shah said to BuzzFeed that thiswasn the first timeshe received such messages: ?I could send you,I not kidding, hundreds of emailsI received ? You know, ?You?re a Muslim,? ?You?re a C-U-N-T? ? I get a lot of, ?Go back to your country.?? The Messenger And His Message The caller identified himself only as ?Alan.? BuzzFeed tracked him down and learned that his name is Alan Pryce. Once the transcript of the message was read to him, Pryce claimed it and said he: ??Stands by every word.?

He did not know, for example, that Ms. Shah was born in the United States. His reaction: ReallyWell,she absolutely a first-gen whatever. Look, Ididn do a biography on her.? He continued: ?Clearly,she an anti-American supporter of a pathological, lying criminal. Anyone who supports [Hillary Clinton], either actively or tacitly, is anti-American scum in my mind.? BuzzFeed reported that Pryce says he was disabled by an undocumented immigrant. He would not give any details, so BuzzFeed could not confirm his story. Pryce had some choice words for McMullin, too (?cuckservative,? which is straight from the alt-right?s racist playbook). But hedoesn mind at all being part of the McMullincampaign ad.

"Story highlights The FBI's latest batch of data show a 3.9% year-over-year increase in violent crime The FBI noted that's still down over five-year and 10-year periods (CNN) Last year saw an increase in violent crime -- including murder -- compared to 2014, according to new data released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Monday. The annual findings showed an estimated 1,197,704 violent crimes, up 3.9% from 2014, while the murder rate spiked by 10.8% over the same span. Those crimes include ""murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault,"" the FBI's website said. But the report indicated that violent crime is still below 2006 and 2011 levels for 10-year and five-year comparisons. The numbers are somewhat expected, reflecting both anecdotal and statistical evidence of an increase in violence since last October. That trend has been visible in several large cities, including Chicago, Baltimore and Washington. Other major cities such as New York and Los Angeles have not experienced the same. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the data show ""we still have so much work to do,"" but stressed the overall numbers are down compared to several years ago.

"Fox News host Megyn Kelly seemed to take a shot at Sean Hannity on Monday night after the much anticipated first presidential debate when she had to throw the live coverage to an interview between her colleague and Republican nominee Donald Trump. Hannity has been a prime target for just about everyone ever since Trump was formally nominated during the last night of the Republican National Convention in July. Former Daily Show host Jon Stewart got the ball rolling that night by torching Hannity for being a complete hypocrite when it comes to how he has covered President Obama in the past to how he treats Donald Trump now. Not long after that, Wall Street Journal foreign affairs columnist Bret Stephens called Hannity the ?dumbest anchor on Fox News,? and the Washington Post followed up by calling Hannity out for lying about Trump coming to the rescue of U.S. Marines. ThenCNN Brian Stelter piled on by nailing Hannity for lying about Hillary Clinton, and Newsweek reporter Kurt Eichenwald slammed Hannity for claiming that Hillary suffers seizures. And now Hannity is getting shade from one of his own colleagues. During the post-debate analysis on Fox News, Kelly had to introduceHannity interview with Donald Trump. And as she introduced the interview, Kelly wondered if Trump would be talking to the actual journalists in the room afterward. ?We?ve got Trump speaking to our own Sean Hannity.We see whether he speaks to the journalists in this room after that interview.?Here the video via YouTube. Trump and Hannity proceeded to trash Hillary Clinton, but it looks like the main focus will be on Kelly for basically telling a lying commentator like Hannity to go f*ck himself. And he definitely deserved the shade. After all, Hannity is not a real journalist. He ignores facts and peddles bullshit and franklyshouldn be allowed anywhere near the airwaves. Hannity isTrump puppet and he clearly cannot be fair and balanced as the network he works for advertises.

"Eric Trump tried to spin a tale on Fox news about how his father started with nothing to build a business empire, only to be smacked down with a reminder that Donald Trump started out as a millionaire. The Republicannominee demon spawn appeared on Outnumbered on Friday and attempted to portray his dad as just a normal guy who started with nothing in his journey to live the American dream. After trashing Hillary Clinton as not being relatable to millennial voters, Eric Trump was asked to explain how his father is relatable to them. And his answer was an effort to rewrite the reality of hisdad life. ?He?s built an amazing company.He become the epitome of the American dream.? Eric Trump said. ?He?s gone from practically nothing to a manwho just?? But that was a total lie and Julie Roginskydidn let the younger Trump get away with it. Roginsky cut Eric Trump off and reminded him that his father got $1 million from his father Fred Trump to start out with. Nothing?? Roginsky said. ?He got a million bucks. Come on, Eric.? Indeed, Donald Trump grew up the son of one of the richest men in America. He has never known poverty in his entire life. In 1978, he was given $1 million by his father, an amount that Trump called a ?small loan? moments after he claimed that life ?hasn?t been easy for me? during a town hall event in October 2015. Of course,that an insult to the millions of Americans who live in poverty daily andcan even get a real small loan to lift themselves out of it. They struggle to put food on the table and to pay the bills, but Donald Trump had everything he could ever want and all the opportunities money could buy.Trump dad also started a million dollar trust fund for him and left him a multi-million dollar inheritance when he died. In other words, Donald Trump knows absolutely NOTHING about starting from nothing. But Eric Trumpdidn addressRoginsky reminder and just continued trying to sell his dad as a man who pulled himself up by his bootstraps. ?He epitomized whatAmerica all about: Opportunity and working hard and being able to achieve your dreams and what you want to succeed, right?? Eric Trump continued. ?It?s no different than a Zuckerberg, right, who went out with a great idea like a Facebook and developed this idea and built it and grew it and grew it and grew it. That is achieving something, right? And I thinkit very different than a person who has been a career politician.?Here the video via VidMe. Can no member ofTrump family actually refrain from lying about their past? Becauseit clear that Donald Trump and his children do not understand what it is like to grow up poor.

"CHAOS! NC Protest MOB Ambushes Female Truck Driver, Loots Truck, Sets Cargo On Fire ? No One Helps!? [VIDEO]There nothing wrong with protesting a perceived injustice. One of our most cherished American rights is the right to peacefully assemble ? to protest. However,that often not what happens when Black Lives Matter activists set out to make a statement. Too often, theydon understand what the words ?peaceful protest? mean. That was proved true once again in North Carolina last night, when a Black Lives Matter mob descended upon a highway and began attacking people. The rioters began by throwing rocks at cars and trucks, protesting the shooting of a black man on that same highway. But it quickly became dangerous, when the mob ambushed a female truck driver. She was trapped in the truck as the rioters looted her truck, stealing the goods and lighting them on fire, all while she was inside. She called police, but they never came. Instead, a media chopper got footage of the violence. ?Try & picture Collapsing Hillary Clinton getting out of bed to deal with Chaos & Violence in N.C #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/KAVPlHmWPb ? 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Shutting down a freeway, throwing rocks at cars, attacking an innocent truck driver and injuring 16 police officers is not.That not a protest;it a riot.

Martin Luther King, Jr. encouraged people to use love, hope and integrity to make a difference when he was fighting for civil rights.It shameful to see the Black Lives Matter movement literally doing the exact opposite. Instead of love, they spread anger and hatred and intolerance. They encourage black people to see themselves as perpetual victims and white people as racist oppressors. How they are able to look at themselves in the mirror without feeling deep shame for their actions is truly beyond comprehension.",0.005934718,0.011869436,0.011869436,0.014836795,0.050445104000000004,0.350148368,0.002967359,1,-1,1
"Washington Since we last updated the CNN battleground map, Donald Trump has clearly improved his poll numbers both in some national polls and in some critical battleground states. The Republican nominee has also upped his game (as have his allied outside group friends) with television ad spending. And, yet, Hillary Clinton maintains her advantage on the Road to 270 when it comes to piecing together the electoral math needed to win the presidency. With four days to go before the highly anticipated first presidential debate and just under 7 weeks before all the votes are cast, Hillary Clinton still sits above that key threshold in the latest CNN outlook. When you add up all the states either solidly or currently leaning Clinton's way, she has 272 electoral votes in her column in our new estimate. Hear CNN Political Director David Chalian explain the new race ratings in his podast: What's changed? -- Iowa (6) moves from from ""battleground"" to ""lean Republican"" -- Utah (6) moves from ""lean Republican"" to ""solid Republican"" -- Maine's 2nd Congressional District (1) moves from ""solid Democrat"" to ""battleground"" -- Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District (1) moves from ""solid Republican"" to ""battleground"" Road to 270: Electoral College map Note: The split congressional district ratings are symbolized with diagonal lines. The state of play Donald Trump has improved his standing in our electoral college outlook due to Iowa (a state Barack Obama won twice) and its six electoral votes moving from the true toss-up ""battleground"" category into the ""lean Republican"" category, giving Trump a total of 196 electoral votes either solidly or leaning in his favor. That leaves 70 electoral votes up for grabs across four states (plus two congressional districts) -- Florida, Nevada, Ohio, and North Carolina. Maine and Nebraska award individual electoral votes by congressional district in addition to the multiple electoral votes based on statewide results. Both Maine and Nebraska's second congressional district have moved into battleground status in this latest estimate. Maine's second congressional district has moved from ""solid Democrat"" to ""battleground"" and Nebraska's second congressional district has moved from ""solid Republican"" to ""battleground,"" providing an opportunity for a candidate to pick up a single electoral vote in what otherwise might be hostile territory. Finally, Utah moves back from ""leaning Republican"" to being solidly being in Trump's column. There is no doubt that Trump has improved his chances in the last several weeks and that he is extremely competitive in all of the remaining critical battleground states, but Clinton's firewall is not yet showing any significant cracks and that is what makes Trump's path to 270 electoral votes still quite challenging. For all of the endless talk about Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, it is perhaps most important to keep your eye on Clinton's performance in the states that are leaning her way, but not solidly in her camp. Pennsylvania, Colorado, Michigan, and Virginia are the core of Clinton's current stronger and more viable path to 270. If Trump begins to find significant inroads to any of those blue-leaning states, that will set off some alarm bells at her Brooklyn HQ and suggest a more viable path for Trump. It is not enough for Trump to simply win the remaining 70 electoral votes in the battleground states -- that only gets him to 266. He still needs to chip away at Clinton's Democratic leaning firewall. That's why we see both Trump and Clinton and their surrogates returning again and again to Pennsylvania, for example. And that's why Clinton and pro-Clinton forces spent more than $16 million on television ads in the Keystone State compared to the $5.3 million we've seen from Trump and pro-Trump forces. In fact, Pennsylvania is the state with the third-highest number of ad dollars spent this cycle, behind only Florida and Ohio. Clinton and Trump will surely continue the fully engaged battle for the votes of Floridians and Ohioans, but until and unless Trump can put one of those Democratic leaning states back on the board as a battleground or even make one lean his way, Clinton's electoral college advantage holds.

"As we know, the final United Nations General Assembly of PresidentObama presidency is occurring in New York City this week. That gave diplomats from around the world to weigh in on thisyear very strange presidential election. Many seem rather rattled about the idea of a Donald Trump presidency, while others merely poked fun atTrump buffoonery. One diplomat mocked Trump, saying, ?he?s a clown.? Another said, ?He?s nuts.? Yet another said that Trump is an ?untrustworthy egomaniacal equivocator.? Well,it too bad so many American citizenscan see these traits in Trump. An Ipsos poll that polled foreign ambassadors who are currently working in America has 60 percent of these people saying they would vote for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton if they were citizens, while only 7 percent would hop on the Trump Train. That in and of itself is very telling. Dennis Jett, who spent much of his career being a diplomat himself and now works for Pennsylvania State University School of International Affairs, says thatTrump behavior has ?made many diplomats nervous and worried about American leadership,America role in the world.? Also curious is the fact that the American people have succumbed to the belief that Hillary is untrustworthy, while 93 percent of those surveyed in the Ipsos poll say that they find Hillary to be somewhator ?very much? in the realm of someone who they feel they can trust. On the other hand, just two in five of those surveyed say that they trust Trump ?a little? while the rest said theydon trust him as far as they can throw him. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier says that Trump is a ?hate preacher? and alluded to the idea that the billionaire tycoon reminds him of demagogues from past times in his own homeland. French PresidentFran Hollande says that the GOPnominee ?excesses make you want to retch.? One lobbyist familiar with the diplomatic community says that there are deepening fears around the world regarding the idea of Trump making it to the White House. Speaking anonymously, the lobbyist said: ?Foreign clients are very concerned about what they perceive as a tipping point in this election. This is less about Democrat versus Republican, and more about open versus closed economy, vis-?-vis the rest of the world. With a wave of nationalism and protectionism sweeping the West, there is a real concern it will take hold in the United States and in what form it might show itself post-election. Whetherit immigration reform or trade policy, it feels as if much of the world is opening while the U.S. is teetering on closing.? Even more alarming, the diplomats say, isTrump ?America First? and isolationist demagoguery. Stephen Walt, who works as a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, says of the situation among diplomats: ?First and most obviously, most foreign governments would like a relatively predictable post-November situation, and I think they regard Trump correctly as a giant leap in the dark. Whatever HillaryClinton strengths or weaknesses might be, she has been a very conventional politician, at least when it comes to foreign policy. Therefore, peopledon anticipate any kind of radical turn ifshe elected.? Of course, another source of more than a little concern isTrump penchant for starting public feuds with longtime allies of the United States, as well as his public musings that he might not honor alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ? which is the single most important military alliance that we have developed since the horrors of World War II. In other words, the entire world is afraid of Donald Trump. Whyaren the American people able to see how dangerous this demagogue is? Donald Trump could single-handedly destroy the world with the power of the presidency.

"Story highlights Donald Trump reacted to the protests in Charlotte by calling for more ""spirit"" between police and communities Trump also clarified that he wants to expand the controversial ""stop-and-frisk"" program only to Chicago (CNN) Donald Trump reacted to the turmoil in Charlotte this week by lamenting ""a lack of spirit between the white and the black,"" adding that ""it's very divided, our country, and it's getting worse, so I'm not overly surprised to see it."" In an interview on ""Fox and Friends"" Thursday morning, Trump pointed to the violent protests over the fatal police shooting of an African-American man in Charlotte as an example of frayed relationships between law enforcement and minority communities across the country. ""It just seems that there's a lack of spirit between the white and the black. I mean, it's a terrible thing that we're witnessing,"" he said. ""You are seeing it, I'm seeing it, and you look at what went on last night in Charlotte, a great place, and you just see it. There's somewhat -- and I see it even going out. There's such a lack of spirit. There's a lack of something, something that's going on that's bad, and what's going on between police and others is getting worse."" Trump had also discussed the tension between police and the communities they serve in a pre-taped town hall that was set to air on Fox News Wednesday night, but which was preempted by coverage of the Charlotte protests. During the town hall, Trump proposed expanding the use of the controversial ""stop-and-frisk"" program by police. ""I think you have to,"" the Republican nominee said at the town hall. ""We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.""

"Under the Radar Blog Archives Select Date? December, 2017 November, 2017 October, 2017 September, 2017 August, 2017 July, 2017 June, 2017 May, 2017 April, 2017 March, 2017 February, 2017 January, 2017 More of Hillary Clinton's emails could be released before Election Day. | Getty Deal nears to speed release of Hillary Clinton emails A potential compromise is in the works that could result in more Hillary Clinton emails recovered by the FBI being made public before the election. Last week, a judge ordered the processing under the Freedom of Information Act of a relatively meager 1,050 pages of the FBI-found emails before Election Day. Government lawyers say the FBI turned over about 5,600 work-related Clinton emails to the State Department beginning in July, although some are duplicates of records already processed and released. During a court hearing in a separate FOIA lawsuit Monday, another judge pushed for a deal that could accelerate the release of those messages, perhaps three-fold, in advance of the Nov. 8 vote, in which Clinton is hoping to win the White House in a showdown with Donald Trump. Acting on a case brought by Vice News journalist Jason Leopold, U.S. District Court Judge Rudolph Contreras ordered the two sides to try to work out a compromise to devote more of State's resources to processing Clinton's emails in the coming weeks, rather than other records Leopold has requested. Contreras ordered both sides to report by Wednesday whether a deal can be reached to speed review of the FBI-found Clinton emails. Ryan James, an attorney for Leopold, said that if it was ""not possible"" for State to allocate more resources to the Clinton email disclosure, Leopold would be ""willing to sacrifice"" pages he's due of other Clinton-related records in order to get more of the emails released. About 2,200 pages of assorted records are scheduled for processing in the coming month in Leopold's case. Speaking of the FBI-recovered emails, James said: ""We believe those records are more important."" Initially, Justice Department attorney Robert Prince did not sound terribly receptive to the proposal. He that said the email-focused part of Leopold's suit against the State Department doesn't even encompass the full set of FBI-provided emails, and that Leopold previously agreed to limit the Clinton email-related portion of his suit to the roughly 54,000 pages of emails Clinton turned over on paper in December 2014. The Vice News reporter initially submitted a very broad request for almost every Clinton-related record at State, but later agreed to narrow it to Clinton emails, as well as other records on specific topics. But Contreras said it would be odd to penalize Leopold for not having foreseen that some emails would be obtained by the FBI. ""No one knew these documents existed ... and these documents should have been in the 55,000,"" the judge said. Prince said the fact they weren't in the roughly 54,000 pages of emails Clinton turned over did not necessarily reflect any impropriety. And there might be valid reasons these emails weren't in that set, he argued. ""Just because Secretary Clinton deleted an email does not mean anything untoward happened here,"" Prince said, noting that federal employees are generally not obliged to save all emails, even those that are-work related. ""I'm not suggesting that,"" replied Contreras, who issued the original order that led to State's public release of the 54,000 Clinton emails ? a process that was completed in February. However, the judge said he believed both sides could work out a compromise that would reallocate some of State's resources to the Clinton email project. ""It seems to me that if the two of you actually spoke to each other, you could reach some agreement,"" Contreras said. ""I'm not going to order that everything be produced by Election Day. That's just impossible."" The judge called a recess in the hearing and ordered the two sides to confer about a possible arrangement. After a half-hour break, Prince returned to the courtroom shortly before noon to say that Justice Department and State Department lawyers handling the case were open to a reallocation of resources but needed approval from Eric Stein, a State Department FOIA official who could not immediately be reached. The potential deal was discussed again Monday afternoon during a separate hearing before U.S. District Court Judge Randolph Moss, who is overseeing a suit Leopold filed against the FBI for certain records related to the Clinton email probe. James, who appeared by phone at both hearings, referred at one point to a ""tentative agreement"" that he said would result in processing an additional 2,200 pages of Clinton emails for release by Oct. 31. That would be on top of the earlier order ? issued in a case brought by the conservative group Judicial Watch ? that State process 350 pages every two weeks, leading to releases on Oct. 7, Oct. 21 and Nov. 4. But Justice Department lawyer Jennie Kneedler said James was overstating how close the parties were to a deal. ""It's under consideration. I wouldn't describe it as a tentative agreement,"" Kneedler said. She also suggested, as Prince did at the earlier hearing, that with various records at various stages of the review process, suspending work on one set of records and moving people to another might not yield as many records as quickly as James was suggesting. ""As I'm sure your honor could appreciate, it's not a simple transfer for resources,"" Kneedler told Moss. Kneedler was unable to tell Moss where the FBI got the additional Clinton emails, although the Justice Department lawyer suggested some may have come from an email account longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin had on Clinton's server. The hearing before Moss proceeded on the assumption that if State determines the Clinton emails are entirely personal, they won't even be processed for release. However, since the records were obtained by the FBI in a criminal investigation, they could be FBI records even if not considered part of State's official files. That could result in partial release of some messages that are not work-related, even if State isn't processing them right now. During the morning hearing, Leopold's lawyer mounted a last-minute bid to try to get any additional emails that may be released sent ""directly"" to the Vice News reporter through his attorney, apparently in lieu of them being made public on State's website. The request echoed a debate among transparency advocates about whether records the government discloses should be immediately released to all via the Internet, or sent to the requester some time before everyone else gets them. Contreras turned down James' request that Leopold have first dibs on any additional emails. ""I'm happy with them posting it on the website. FOIA is about informing the public what their government is up to and that means everybody,"" the judge said. The issue did not arise before Moss, with all parties saying they expected any additional Clinton emails to be posted on State's website.

"Off Message 5 takeaways from the first presidential debate She hits him where it hurts, and his defensiveness makes him seem wimpy. There were a couple of not-so-very-subtle signals here inside of Hofstra University that Donald Trump lost Mondaynight highly-anticipated debate against Hillary Clinton, and badly. The first was the audible sound of groaning by some of his supporters (picked up by my attentive colleague Steve Shepard) inside the debate hall as Trump meandered self-defensively through a succession of answers against a very focused, very energized and very well-rehearsed Hillary Clinton. Story Continued Below Another tell: After the 90-minute sparring match finished,Clinton team practically bounded into the spin room ? more in glassy-eyed disbelief than visible elation that things had gone so much better than expected. The GOPnominee people, by contrast, dribbled into the media pen like surly seventh-graders headed for homeroom the day before summer vacation. ?F?k,let do this,? a prominent Trump surrogate said before diving into a scrum. Trump and his new-ish messaging team have labored mightily to turn the avatar of populist rage into a reasonable facsimile of someone who you could see sitting in the Oval Office. But this best-laid plan unraveled on Monday ? amidClinton steely assault and the dignified interrogation ofNBC Lester Holt, who struck a deft balance between facilitator, BS detector and lion tamer. Within minutes of the opening bell,Clinton attacks forced domesticated Donald to go feral ? he bellowed, interrupted her repeatedly, grunted, and toward the bedraggled end, became muted and pouty. ?It was bizarre,? said BarackObama campaign manager David Plouffe, who, like many Clinton allies, seemed visibly relieved. ?He was clearly rattled, and clearly focused on defending himself, whichI told narcissists are prone to do, and he clearly faded at the end.It not likeshe going to jump out to a 10-point lead, but this was good.? Whether or not this reversesTrump momentum, or reestablishes Clinton's control of the race is an open question. Who won is not. Here are five takeaways. Trump was wimpy when defensive. He is supposed to be the big meanie but it was Clinton who hit him where it hurt most. Itdoesn take a Jung (or even Dr. Phil after a couple of Bud Lights) to figure out that the GOP nominee ? who boasts like a barfly ? just might be over-compensating. Hence, Clinton, who started the debate a little tentatively, quickly launched into a carefully planned program of Freudian mind-games, contrasting her own middle-class businessman dad (who had his own issues) withTrump imperious, larger-than-life father Fred who launched hisson business career but also was said to be extremely tough on him. First she started in with a paean to herfather running a small printing business in Chicago (This might be the first time a candidate has described, in detail, the silk-screen squeegee process on a debate stage) ? then she pivoted to mocking supposedly self-madeTrump start in the real estate business. ?You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father,? she said icily. ?My father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars,? he responded weakly ? and so it went on a range of topics. Whether it was because Clinton was so well prepped, and Trump was so breezily unprepared ? or had a simple case of opening night jitters ? the bully-boy nominee abandoned his most effective mode of debate combat, answering an attack with a harsher one. She went right forTrump ego ? questioning his questionable $11 billion net worth, his boastful record on job creation and picking apart his tough talk on fighting ISIS. View The 10 most memorable moments of the presidential debate Here are the most memorable and important moments of the night from the first presidential debate at Hofstra University on Monday. In 2007, preparing for a primary raceshe eventually lose, Clinton told me that the key to presidential political campaigns was understanding that the most effective attacksweren about exploitingsomeone weaknesses but challenging anopponent perceived strengths. When confronted with that assault, Trump wilted and offered a series of meandering answers that had his Republicans wincing. ?It was a draw,? former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown said. ?But he was on the defensive far too much.That a direct result of his inexperience.? What about the Clinton Foundation? The formersecretary debate team (including longtime aide Phillippe Reines, who snapped a pre-debate photo in a Trump circled-finger pose) expected him to savage her on the various questions raised about herfamily foundation. They were worried about it. While he hammered her ever-so-briefly on emails, he was so engaged in self-justification, he flat-out forgot to pursue an attack that could have made the night a lot less lousy. His ?30 years? attack worked ? andhe use it again. Trump may have lost the first debate, buthe proven to be a fast learner, and is likely to come back stronger in early October for the second debate, a town hall style affair, in St. Louis. And there were a few gold nuggets strewn in the wreckage of Hofstra ? the most valuable an assault (demonstrable and fact-checker-friendly) onClinton effectiveness in 25-plus years of public life. The been-there-not-done-that argument was particularly useful when coupled with his usual slams on BillClinton passage of the increasingly unpopular NAFTA agreement from the 1990s and HillaryClinton election-year flip-flop from TPP booster to opponent. ?When she started talking about this, it was really very recently,? Trump said of her opposition to the trade deal. ?She's been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn't she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact.? When Clinton claimed that she planned to ?really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.? He scoffed, and shot back, ?But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years.? Clinton effectively attacked his business career.Trump attempt to head off debate-night questions about his five-year campaign promoting the birther slander against Barack Obama was a humbling face-plant. His attempt to pin the origin of the charge against Clinton associate Sid Blumenthal was semi-effective with the political press, but it withered under the insistent interrogation of an African-American moderator determined to extract an apology or reasonable explanation. Trump offered neither ? and suggested Obama should actually be grateful he pursued the canard becauseit now been resoundingly put to rest. Politically, his tortured explanation helps energize black voters ? who already oppose him in historic numbers. But later in the debate, Clinton plucked the strains of what could be a genuine crossover hit this fall among ever-elusive white working-class voters and independents:Trump failure to turn over his tax returns. Clinton went there with a vengeance ? engaging in a little Trump-esque fact-free speculation about the motives of the billionaire developer-turned-reality TV star. ?So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?? Clinton mused, with relish. ?And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be. Third, we don't know all of his business dealings... Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.?Trump answer did more harm than good: ?That makes me smart,? he said ? referring to his business, not his political, acumen. Her most effective attack ? and his worst answer. If the GOP nominee needed any more proof that preparation trumps bombast in a general election debate, he got it when Clinton launched a merciless attack on his habit of stiffing contractors who have labored on his construction projects over the years. Again, Clinton brought it back to her father, describing how bad he would have felt if one of his clients had accepted his work without paying his bill. ""I?ve met dishwashers, painters, architects, marble installers, drapery installers, who you refused to pay when they finished the work you asked them to do,? Clinton said, delivering a carefully scripted attack. ?We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses. It's a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use. And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do.? This is a particular dangerous issue for a candidate whose entire campaign is rooted in fighting for the working class -- and his flippant response, yet again, gave comfort to his enemies. ?Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work,? Trump quipped.",0.025352113,0.00657277,0.008450704,0.012206573,0.044131455,0.262910798,0.001877934,2,-1,1

"Giuliani: I'd skip next debates if I were Trump Donald Trump should skip the next two debates unless he gets special guarantees from the moderators, former New York mayor and top Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani told reporters after the debate. Lester Holt, the NBC News anchor who moderated the debate, should be ?ashamed of himself,? Giuliani said after the debate. He said Holt was wrong to attempt to fact-check Trump on the constitutionality of stop-and-frisk and his claimed opposition to the Iraq War. Story Continued Below ?If I were Donald Trump Iwouldn participate in another debate unless I was promised that the journalist would act like a journalist and not an incorrect, ignorant fact checker,? Giuliani said. ?The moderator would have to promise that there would be a moderator and not a fact checker and in two particular cases an enormously ignorant, completely misinformed fact checker.? ?If you wonder why Donald Trump thinks that the press is a left-wing basically oriented group, Lester Holt proved it tonight,"" he added. He later clarified about future debates: ?Ididn say whatI advising him, I said what I would do.? Trump himself had no problem with Holt's performance. The moderator did a ""fine"" job, Trump said. But Giuliani was especially piqued byHolt claim that ?stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York.? ?No, you're wrong. It went before a judge who was a very-against-police judge,? Trump responded. ?It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal.? ?Stop and frisk is completely constitutional and the American people have been given the false impression that itisn,? Giuliani said. A federal district court judge ruled in 2013 that New YorkCity stop-and-frisk policy violated the Constitution.

"The hosts of Fox & Friends were hoping a Minnesota police chief would vilify the Somali immigrants in his community and they promptly got their asses handed to them. On Saturday, 22-year-old Dahir A. Adan went on a stabbing spree inside a Minnesota mall. The Somali community in St. Cloud has roundly condemned the act of terrorism, but Republican nominee Donald Trump spewed fear and hate in response during a phone call with Fox and called the immigrants a ?Trojan horse? and a ?cancer from within? that benefits ISIS. Fox host Steve Doocy, who was named in GretchenCarlson sexual harassment lawsuit against the conservative network, asked St. Cloud Police Chief William Blair Anderson if he agrees withTrump assessment of immigrants, clearly hoping that Anderson would join in demonizing them. Instead, Anderson swatted Doocy down like the pest he is and made it clear that there are bad apples in every group and that we should unite rather than divide and hate. ?My job is public safety.It not in immigration policy. I can tell you that the vast majority of all of our citizens, no matter their ethnicity, are fine, hard-working people, and now is not the time for us to be divisive. We already have a very cohesive community, and I expect that this will draw us even closer together. But at the end of the day, our job is public safety, period.? Anderson then explained that law enforcement works well with all members of the community to protect the public the best they can. ?We actually work very well not just with our East African community, but all of our community. We meet regularly with any number of people, whether they are advocates for a specific ethnicity or different cause.It one of things that makes St. Cloud a wonderful place to live, and I know that might sound corny, butit the truth. We have established and maintained a very good rapport with our East African community and our community at large.? Doocy then tucked his tail between his legs and ended the interview because hedidn get the response he wanted.Here the video via Media Matters: Demonizing an entire community simply because of the actions of a few only ostracizes them and could cause more to radicalize.That why we should reach out to these immigrants instead of hating them. Fox News is irresponsibly pushing an ?us versus them? mentality that only creates a never-ending circle of hate and mistrust that hurts our country in the long-term. Butlet also remember that ISIS would not exist to recruit people in America in the first place had Republicans not pursued an unnecessary war in Iraq that created the power vacuum that allowed ISIS to rise. Furthermore, despite their concerns and their whining, Republicans still refuse to declare war on ISIS to give President Obama the full resources of the United States to fight the terrorist organization. Regardless, any group will have bad apples, even the white ChristiansFox News caters to.Let not forget that Timothy McVeigh committed the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 that killed 168 people while Dylan Roof gunned down nine black people inside a church in 2015. Both acts of domestic terrorism were committed by white males who were born here in the United States. But Fox News would rather freak out about a Somali immigrant who used a knife in an attack in which no one was killed. If Adan were white, not only would this not be referred to as an act of terror, it would have been a mere footnote in the news.

" Rapper YG really wants you to know he doesn't like Donald Trump. While other hip-hop artists like Rick Ross, Jeezy and TI have publicly dissed the Republican presidential nominee, none have gotten as much traction as YG, and arguably, none have been as singularly focused. In the lead-up to his second studio album, ""Still Brazy,"" the California rapper dropped a single called ""FDT,"" a song whose title is made up of the GOP nominee's initials and an expletive. As the track opens, YG says, ""Me and all my peoples, we always thought he was straight, influential motherf---er when it came to the business. But now, since we know how you really feel, this is how we feel. F--- Donald Trump."" Then he launches into his anthem, cursing the real estate mogul's name dozens of times. It was something of a new area for the West Coast rapper. The songs off his first album, like ""Bicken back being bool"" or ""Who do you love,"" were largely apolitical, even if they did veer into socially conscious territory once in a while. By his own admission, YG is ""not political."" He told CNN in a wide-ranging interview about his music over the summer his concerns over issues like Trump's anti-Mexican rhetoric and his dismissal of police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement led him to speak out. ""He can't be counted on to handle these issues. This issue is important to the black community, period. It's life,"" YG said. ""This s--- is bigger than hip- hop. ... We're supposed to use our platform to speak up and bring our brothers together and put some light on some of this s--- that's not right for our people."" JUST WATCHED Trump on Black Lives Matter leaders Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump on Black Lives Matter leaders 01:34 YG also called out other rappers for not speaking out against what he considers a ""racist"" campaign. He said they were putting their personal interests and fear of backlash over their beliefs. ""They're scared on what comes with it, what could come with it,"" YG said, adding, ""They're not doing business with Trump. ... They're saying they ain't political. They ain't going to get into all this s---... I'm not political either bro, but guess what? All that s--- matters."" YG said that fear of backlash is not unfounded, and added that he has faced repercussions over his song. He told TMZ in April that the US Secret Service reached out to his record label after he dropped ""FDT."" ""If I talk about him on my album, they're gonna try to take it off the shelf,"" YG told TMZ. Secret Service spokeswoman Nicole Mainor declined to verify or deny those claims, telling CNN, ""The Secret Service does not discuss protective investigations."" Potential Secret Service warnings aside, the Compton rapper hasn't let up. In May 2016, he released a video where he read the lyrics to ""FDT"" from behind a podium, offering the lines as a point-by-point rebuttal to a Trump speech. Just before the Republican National Convention, YG released ""FDT Part 2,"" a remix featuring unlikely YG collaborators Macklemore and G-Eazy. On his verse to close out the song, YG nods to the two white rappers joining him and says of Trump, ""your own kind don't even like you."" ""I'm on tour with two of the biggest white rappers in the game right now,"" YG said. ""(The) fan base a little different than mine. So I'm touching a lot of new people that I ain't never touched before. So it's a good thing. That's what it's about."" YG performs during day 1 of the 2014 Budweiser Made in America Festival at Los Angeles Grand Park on August 30, 2014 in Los Angeles, California. But YG did not leave it at that either. In mid-August, he announced a nationwide ""F--- Donald Trump"" tour, giving the song a final whirl before Election Day. Then in mid-September he released a skit teasing his tour, where an actor playing Trump says ""what do they got to lose,"" recalling the Republican nominee's outreach to African Americans. The rapper has not decided whether he will vote in November and said that his opposition to Trump is not a show of support for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. ""Out of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, I would rather Clinton be president but just overall, I would rather Obama have a third term,"" YG said.",0.024054983,0.003436426,0.003436426,0.017182131,0.04982817900000001,0.24398625399999999,0.001718213,2,-1,1
" It's the world's toughest ""to do"" list: stop violent extremism, solve the worst global refugee crisis in a quarter century, foster peace in the ravaged Middle East and -- in the meantime -- work to end poverty, disease, hunger and the threat of nuclear weapons. That's the agenda as more than 140 heads of state and government descend on New York this week for the annual United Nations General Assembly. As the world grapples with these and other pressing issues, US domestic politics may claim space on the New York stage: Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is set to meet some world leaders in Manhattan this week as her family's controversial charitable foundation hosts the final meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative.

In the Middle East, the world is watching to see if a shaky ceasefire will take root in Syria, where the five-year-old civil war and the brutality of ISIS have destabilized the region. That destabilization has seen European countries overwhelmed by record-breaking numbers of refugees moving across their borders, redefining the continent's political landscape and heightening the threat of terrorist infiltrators.

That destabilization has seen European countries overwhelmed by record-breaking numbers of refugees moving across their borders, redefining the continent's political landscape and heightening the threat of terrorist infiltrators. Terror threat Terrorism is already casting a particularly dark shadow over this meeting, as New York police investigate a Saturday bombing in Manhattan that injured 29 people. It occurred on the same day that a blast disrupted a Marine Corps charity run in New Jersey and a man stabbed nine people at a Minnesota mall. All three incidents are being investigated as possible terror attacks and security around UN events will likely be even more stringent than usual. Global leaders will hold special breakout sessions on refugees, Syria and Libya, where instability has also created openings for ISIS and other extremist groups. They'll address other priorities, too, including climate change, human rights, sustainable development and UN reform. Heightened tension On the sidelines, Obama will meet with world leaders. On Monday, he's set to discuss North Korea's nuclear tests and other Asian issues with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. On Wednesday, Obama will review a newly signed $38 billion aid package for Israel with its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and discuss the prospects for Mideast peace. He'll also meet with leaders such as Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos. Amid the week-long swirl of meetings at the iconic rectangular UN building bordering Manhattan's East River, there will also be the usual smaller dramas: the leaders who use their speeches to denounce rivals in impolitic ways and heated speculation about potentially fraught or historic meetings. Last year, a tense meeting between Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin was swiftly followed by Moscow's intervention in Syria. This year, existing tensions will be heightened by a US strike on Syrian forces that the military had thought was an ISIS target, administration officials said. JUST WATCHED Obama administration regrets Syrian military deaths Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Obama administration regrets Syrian military deaths 02:57 Russia called an emergency UN Security Council meeting, arguing that the Saturday strike showed the US isn't fully committed to cooperating with Moscow on the fight against militant groups including ISIS and warned that the Syrian ceasefire might break down as a result. ""We consider what happened as a natural result of the persistent refusal of the United States from the establishment of close cooperation with Russia in the fight against ISIS, Jabhat al-Nusra and other affiliated terrorist groups,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement Sunday. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, the architects of the nascent ceasefire, are expected to meet and may offer an update on its progress. The US Ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, expressed regret for the loss of life Saturday, but added that, ""Even by Russia's standards, tonight's stunt -- a stunt replete with moralism and grandstanding -- is uniquely cynical and hypocritical."" Iran question Since 2011, Power said, ""the Assad regime has been intentionally striking civilian targets with horrifying, predictable regularity."" The 2015 General Assembly also featured a historic handshake between Obama and Iranian president Hassan Rouhani. This year, with the Iran nuclear deal under fire in Tehran and a tight US presidential campaign underway, political observers wonder if the two men will meet again. State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner couldn't say if even Kerry will meet officially with his Iranian counterparts, men he knows well from months of nuclear talks. ""We just don't have anything to confirm at this point,"" Toner said. Kerry also met Sunday with Asian allies to discuss North Korea and tensions in the South China Sea as a rising Beijing asserts itself in the region. Amid all this, the US will be focusing on ""three topline priorities,"" according to Bathsheba Crocker, the State Department's assistant secretary for international organizations, listing ""humanitarian response, peace and security, and countering terrorism and violent extremism."" Kerry will touch on humanitarian needs at a high-level Monday meeting on refugees. The next day, Obama hosts a Leaders Summit on Refugees. The US announced Wednesday that it will increase the number of refugees it absorbs from 85,000 this year to 110,000 in 2017. And on Friday, the administration said it would give $11 million to a UN fund that helps countries accepting refugees. Waves of people fleeing countries such as Syria, South Sudan and Afghanistan have overwhelmed the international refugee system. Unprecedented strains According to the UN, more than 21 million people are displaced today, half of them children, all of them in need of food, shelter, safety and livelihoods. They are placing unprecedented strains on their host countries, driving the rise of right-leaning anti-immigrant political parties in Europe and becoming a divisive US presidential campaign issue as well. In April, Republican candidate Donald Trump warned a crowd to ""lock your doors"" to stay safe from Syrian refugees, and in June added that ""a lot of those people are ISIS."" Crocker said Obama's leader summit on Tuesday aims to yield ""significant sustained commitments to UN humanitarian appeals, expanded refugee resettlement programs or alternative legal pathways for admission, and new opportunities for refugees and their host communities to benefit from improved refugee access to education and legal employment.""

"The Clinton campaign has slammed Donald Trump as ?a fraud who believes the rulesdon apply to him? over reports that the GOP presidential candidate used money from his charitable foundation to settle two lawsuits filed against his for-profit businesses. The Washington Post reported today that Trump made two payments totaling $258,000 to settle suits ? one involving the Mar-a-Lago Club, which he owns, in Florida and another involving one of his golf clubs in New York.Clinton Camp ReactsClinton deputy communications director, Christina Reynolds, put out a statement after The Washington Post story was published, calling Trump a fraud. ?Clearly the Trump Foundation is as much a charitable organization as Trump University is an institute of higher education,? she said. ?Trump?s version of charity is taking money from others to settle his own legal issues ... which experts say is a clear violation of laws governing charitable organizations,? Reynolds said. Lucien Capehart/Getty Images ABC News has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment. Lloyd Mayer, a professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School, told ABC News that if the allegations made by the Post are true, the payments violate federal law. John Roca/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images ?Federal tax law bars a private foundation like the Trump Foundation from using its assets to benefit its insiders or the businesses they own.That exactlywhat been alleged here. If true, the foundation and its managers, including Mr. Trump, violated tax laws,? Mayer told ABC News. A Lawsuit Behind the Allegations The lawsuit involving Mar-a-Lago, filed in 2007, revolved around a complaint by the town of Palm Beach over an oversize flagpole at the club. Publicly available court documents show that as a condition of a settlement, ?Mr. Trump will contribute $100,000 to charities agreed to between the parties? in return for thetown waiving fines against Mar-a-Lago. Another section of the court documents specified, ?Mar-a-Lago shall contribute $100,000 to charities agreed to between parties dealing with Iraq War veterans, American flag or the local VA hospital.? Richard Corkery/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images In a September 2007 letter to the town, as reported by the Post, Trump wrote, ?I have sent a check for $100,000 to Fisher House. Although the court documents show that under the settlement, Trump or Mar-a-Lago would make the payment, the payment apparently instead came from the Trump Foundation. Tax forms for the Trump Foundation show that in 2007 the charity gave $100,000 to Fisher House, an organization that helps pay for housing for veterans? relatives when their loved ones are receiving medical treatment. It was one of only three $100,000 donations it made that year; the other two were to a New York hospital and a police athletic league. Fisher House confirmed to ABC News that it received a $100,000 check from the foundation on Sept. 11, 2007. It does not have a copy of the check available. Legal Questions The IRS has strict rules on the operation of tax-exempt private foundations, including against what it calls self-dealing. To qualify for tax-exempt status, a foundation is required to demonstrate, among other things, that ?no part of its net earnings inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual,? according to an online IRS publication. Mayer noted that if the lawsuit settlement was paid for byTrump foundation, hewouldn be the first person to violate tax law in this way. ?It?s not unheard of for people to use their private foundations for their own benefit. Usually if the IRS learns about it, the insider has to pay a penalty tax and repay foundation with interest,? Mayer said. It can be a civil action or a criminal violation, but Mayer has ?never heard of anyone serving prison time for this kind of thing.? ?Here the foundation allegedly paid for a substantial benefit toTrump business ? the dropping of lawsuits. That is clearly crossing the line.It not even close,? he said. The Foundation Takes in Money Other ThanTrump The Trump Foundation takes in substantial donations from people and organizations, including until eight years ago Trump himself. In 2007, tax forms show that the charity had revenue of close to $4.1 million, from contributions, gifts and grants. Of that total, Trump donated $35,000. Similarly, in 2008, Trump gave $30,000 to the foundation. In previous years, his contributions were bigger, ranging from $184,000 to $713,000. Trump made no donations to his foundation from 2009 to 2014, which is the last year for which records are available. A few years after the Mar-a-Lago settlement, the foundation reportedly paid $158,000 to settle a lawsuit against one ofTrump golf courses in New York, which led to a charitable donation by the foundation. The foundation is under investigation by the New York AttorneyGeneral Office over a payment made to a political group associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a Trump supporter who spoke at the Republican National Convention this summer. A person familiar with the probe tells ABC News that the New York AttorneyGeneral Office is also investigating all the donations mentioned in the Post report. The Clintoncampaign Reynolds said in her statement, ?Once again, Trump has proven himself a fraud who believes the rulesdon apply to him.It past time for him to release his tax returns to show whether his tax issues extend to his own personal finances.?

"Trump touted the much-maligned program during a Fox News town hall that was pre-taped for Wednesday night but didn't air, responding to a question about how he would stem ""violence in the black community."" He clarified on ""Fox and Friends"" Thursday morning that he was specifically proposing expanding the program only to Chicago, highlighting the city's gun violence epidemic and comparing the situation to New York in the 1990s. ""(Former NYPD Commissioner) Ray Kelly did a great job and New York was not in a Chicago situation, but it was really in trouble. It was in bad shape, crime wise, with all the shootings and everything,"" he said. ""And it really -- Rudy Giuliani did a great job as mayor, and they really straightened things out with stop-and-frisk and it was used further by the next mayor, Bloomberg, and now they just recently -- not so recently, but fairly recently -- they stopped it."" Under stop and frisk, police stop people on the street who they deem suspicious and think may be involved in criminal activity and search them on the spot for guns and illegal drugs, among other things. Trump said the program worked and that it could impact gun violence in Chicago. ""Now Chicago is out of control. I was really referring to Chicago stop and frisk. They asked me about Chicago. And I was talking about stop and frisk for Chicago,"" he said. Trump had praised the practice -- which a federal judge ruled in New York in 2013 was unconstitutional, and unlawfully targeted blacks and Latinos, although it was not banned outright -- in similar terms at the town hall Wednesday night. ""One of the things I'd do ... is I would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically,"" Trump said in response to an audience member's question. Trump has previously touted stop-and-frisk policies, but his full-throated endorsement of it Wednesday -- in which he called for its widespread implementation -- came as Trump pressed forward with his pitch to African-American voters, appearing at a predominantly black church alongside several of his prominent black surrogates. That pitch to African-Americans hasn't come without a series of slip-ups, the latest of which came as Trump invited the prominent boxing promoter Don King, who is black, to introduce him at the church event -- only to have the celebrity use the N-word at the podium. And on Tuesday, Trump described the state of African-American communities as being in ""absolutely the worst shape that they've ever been in before. Ever. Ever. Ever."" and comparing the US's inner cities to Afghanistan. While Trump has pledged to bring jobs and safety to the inner cities, he has offered few specifics as to how he would address those issues. But Trump has called for beefing up the number of police officers in inner cities and argued that police officers need more latitude to do their jobs and backing from political figures -- a push not necessarily consistent with African-Americans' frustrations over the spate of police shootings against unarmed black men, which have rocked the country. ""You have to have, in my opinion -- I see what's going on here, I see what's going on in Chicago -- I think stop-and-frisk. In New York City it was so incredible, the way it worked. Now, we had a very good mayor, but New York City was incredible, the way that worked, so I think that could be one step you could do,"" Trump said Wednesday. The real estate mogul's call for introducing stop-and-frisk as a prescription for reducing ""black-on-black crime"" -- as the questioner put it in the town hall -- is also likely to face a stiff rebuke from minority leaders. Many have opposed the practice during its use by New York City police as minorities were disproportionally targeted. In August 2013 a federal judge ruled that the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy violated the constitutional rights of minorities in New York. She didn't order an outright ban, but called for reform of the policy and outside oversight. The city under Mayor Michael Bloomberg appealed that ruling, but those efforts were dropped under de Blasio's administration, and the city is participating in an ongoing reform and oversight process, which is supervised by a federal monitor. ""The United States Constitution guarantees the rights of all Americans, and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York already ruled in 2013 that stop-and-frisk, as previously practiced in New York, was unconstitutional,"" said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland. ""These policies erode trust between law enforcement officers and the communities they serve. Plus, they have proven to be ineffective."" A November 2013 report from the New York attorney general revealed just 3% of stop-and-frisk stops led to convictions between 2009 and 2012. And in more than 5 million stops between 2002 and 2013, police recovered guns less than 0.02% of the time, according to police department data compiled by the New York Civil Liberties Union in a 2014 report. Stop-and-frisk was instituted by one of Trump's most prominent supporters and advisers, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani has continued to defend the practice in recent years, rebutting the statistics showing little correlation between stop-and-frisk and a reduction in crime. Giuliani frequently joins Trump on the campaign trail -- where he is introduced as ""America's mayor"" -- and argues that Trump will bring the same tough-on-crime approach to the presidency. Trump recently praised the stop-and-frisk policy in an interview earlier this month in Philadelphia where he was asked about the African-American communities' concerns that stop-and-frisk amounts to racial profiling. ""Well, I think you are going to have it. So many people are being killed in Philadelphia, that it's actually incredible when you look at the stats. I think you have to have it,"" he said in an interview with the local NBC station. Trump pressed forward with his pitch to African-American voters Wednesday afternoon during a rally in Toledo, Ohio -- where he again described black lives in the US in bleak terms. ""To the African-American community, I say: vote for Donald J. Trump. I will fix it -- and I say, honestly, what do you have to lose? It's not gonna get any worse. It's terrible. The crime, the bad education, the no jobs. What do you have to lose? Believe me, I will fix it. I'm gonna fix it,"" Trump said. But New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday that the belief that stop-and-frisk caused the city's crime rate to plummet is false. ""I understand that people say that, (but) that's just not the history,"" he told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" The mayor said it was former New York City Police Department Commissioner Bill Bratton promoting community policing in 1994 that led to the decrease of crime in the city. ""That's what changed things in New York City,"" de Blasio said. ""The bottom line is it (stop-and-frisk) created a huge line of division between police and communities."" ""We ended that unconstitutional use of stop-and-frisk, that overuse of stop-and-frisk,"" he added. De Blasio said that crime has actually decreased since the city all but ended stop-and-frisk three years ago. And that Trump's facts on policing are inaccurate and would reverse the progress that the city has made, the mayor said. ""Donald Trump talks about stop-and-frisk like he knows the facts,"" he said. ""He has had no experience with policing, no experience with public safety."" ""He should really be careful because if we reinstituted stop-and-frisk all over this country, you'd see a lot more tension between police and communities,"" de Blasio added.

The city appealed the ruling at the time, but has since dropped that effort and is participating in an ongoing reform and oversight process.",0.030271398999999997,0.0073068890000000004,0.002087683,0.009394572,0.056367432,0.254697286,0.003131524,2,-1,1
"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from herdaughter apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at ChelseaClinton apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past. The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type. Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent.Hillary stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does. Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself. The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates? What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton. The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In. It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity. If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential. The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

"President Barack Obama has never had a great relationship with Saudi Arabia. Now,he the last man standing between the wealthy desert kingdom and billions of dollars in potential liabilities. Story Continued Below Obama has cast the Saudis as ""so-called"" allies; bemoaned the terrorist-inspiring version of Islam they practice; and even suggested the oil-rich Arab state learn to ""share"" the Middle East with rival Iran. The Saudis, meanwhile, consider Obama naive, sparring with him over the Iran nuclear deal and questioning his hands-off approach toSyria bloody civil war. Despite these differences, Obama has promised to veto a bill that Congress passed unanimously allowing families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia over alleged links to the 2001 terrorist attacks. That Obama and Riyadh find themselves on the same side against Congress underscores the bizarre evolution of U.S.-Saudi ties over the past eight years. An alliance once unquestioned in Washington now faces an extraordinary level of criticism, but the two countries still need each other enough that a breakup is simply not in the cards. ""This is clearly a relationship in transition,"" said Jon Alterman, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Nobody really has a sense of whatthey trying to transition it to."" Just how tricky is the relationship? Two more examples: Obama is supporting the Saudis in their fight against Iran-backed rebels in Yemen, even though U.S. officials worry the fight there is distracting from the more important battle against the Islamic State. And many of the same U.S. lawmakers happy to make it easier to sue the Saudis just this week green-lit a $1.15 billion arms sale to the country. ""Does no one sense the irony?? asked Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, one of a handful of lawmakers who tried to block the weapons deal in the Senate. The back and forth in Washington is ""schizophrenic behavior"" that has deeply frustrated leaders in the Middle East for years, said a former senior U.S. official deeply familiar with the Arab world. Congress passed the lawsuit bill under intense pressure from families of victims and just ahead of the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. The Saudis, through direct contacts as well as a powerful set of lobbyists, have tried hard to stop it, waging a major PR effort that included releasing a white paper detailing the kingdom's efforts to stop terrorists. The Saudis deny any government role in the attacks and note that the U.S. has never found proof of it, either. The Saudis also have warned they will sell off billions of dollars in U.S. assets to protect themselves against lawsuits. Administration officials downplay the idea that Obama will veto the bill merely to protect Saudi Arabia. Normally, U.S. citizens aren't allowed to sue foreign governments under the concept of sovereign immunity. Obama's concern, officials say, thus goes well beyond the Saudis; he's worried that the bill erodes the sovereign immunity principle and could lead other countries to allow the U.S. to be sued over its actions abroad. ""To pass a piece of legislation that would open up our diplomats and our service members and even American businesses to potential lawsuits in courts all around the world is foolish,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a recent press briefing. The perception in many quarters, however, is that Obama is coming to the aid of a country with much to hide. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11, 2001, were Saudi nationals. And the recent declassification of roughly 30 pages from a 2002 congressional probe into the 9/11 attacks raised more questions about Saudi government ties to Islamist extremists. ""We are disappointed that the president is not standing with us,"" said Mindy Kleinberg, who lost her husband in the attacks and was meeting with lawmakers Thursday to push for a veto override. ""We have been waiting a very long time for justice, and we feel that this bill will go a long way toward accountability."" Whatever his motivation, Obama's decision to veto the bill is unlikely to do much to ease Saudi suspicions. The Saudis' wariness of Obama has its roots in his comments in 2002, well before he ran for president, referring to the monarchy in Riyadh as a so-called ally. It grew after Obama sided against Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak during the 2011 Arab Spring movements, leading Saudi royals to question whether America would have their backs in a domestic political crisis of their own. It deepened in 2013, after Obama decided not to stage a military strike against Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is despised by the Saudis, even after Assad apparently crossed Obama's ""red line"" by using chemical weapons. And it reached a new peak in 2015 after Obama struck a nuclear deal with Iran, a Shiite theocracy that Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia views as a growing threat in the Middle East. Still, Obama, cognizant of the need for the U.S. to maintain alliances with stable countries in the Middle East, has otherwise tried hard to allay Saudi concerns. He cut short a trip to India to rush to see the newly crowned Saudi king, Salman, in January 2015, after the previous monarch died. He also has pushed for new weapons and other security agreements with the Saudis, in part to assuage Saudi concerns about the Iran nuclear deal. But earlier this year, in comments to the Atlantic magazine that infuriated the Saudis, Obama appeared to reverse decades of U.S. policy that tilted heavily toward Riyadh and against Tehran. ?The competition between the Saudis and the Iranians ? which has helped to feed proxy wars and chaos in Syria and Iraq and Yemen ? requires us to say to our friends as well as to the Iranians that they need to find an effective way to share the neighborhood and institute some sort of cold peace,? Obama said. Prince Turki Al-Faisal, the former head of Saudi intelligence, wrote in an extraordinary open letter soon afterward that Obama had ""thrown us a curve ball"" and criticizing the president for sayingAmerica Gulf allies were ?free riders? wholly dependent on the U.S. for their security. And in April, weeks after the Atlantic piece was published, Saudi Arabia appeared to snub Obama when he visited Riyadh for a summit by sending a lower-level official to greet him at the airport and not broadcasting his arrival on state TV. The readouts from those meetings in Riyadh also suggested the president hadn't done much to assuage Saudi concerns, with the two sides saying they'd ""discussed"" and ""exchanged views"" more than agreeing on anything. The president also hosted SaudiArabia deputy crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, when he visited Washington this summer on a trip aimed at improving thekingdom image in Washington. Obama made sure to praise the prince's plan to transform the Saudi economy, dubbed Vision 2030. He also tried to reassure the Saudi royal that the U.S. will back the Saudis against interference by Iran, which remains an official enemy of the United States. But some constants in the U.S.-Saudi relationship have turned into variables, meaning that even after Obama leaves office in just a few months, the alliance could prove rocky. The low price of oil, for example, is forcing the kingdom to rethink its economy; the U.S. also relies more now on its own energy reserves, reducingAmerica addiction to Saudi oil. Some observers also point to cultural changes in deeply conservative Saudi Arabia ? women, though still facing severe segregation, make up a growing share of the workforce; young people are more exposed than ever to the Internet and the outside world; and thousands of Saudis educated in the U.S. are now capitalizing on that experience in their country. By all accounts, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia still maintain a strong security relationship, and U.S. officials privately say the Saudis are helpful partners in the fight against terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda, which the Saudi monarchy views as a threat to its own rule. U.S. officials also say the Saudis have taken steps in recent years to silence the most radical of their Islamist preachers and change their school curricula to be more tolerant. ""The close cooperation on countering violent extremists like [the Islamic State], the continued Saudi preference for American arms, the important role that Saudi Arabia plays in international energy markets and the $70 billion dollars worth of annual trade between the two countries are enough to sustain this relationship for the foreseeable future,"" said Fahad Nazer, a former political analyst with the Saudi Embassy in Washington who now does similar work for JTG Inc. In many ways, what Obama thinks about the Saudis matters less and less as his time in the Oval Office draws to an end. But while the Saudis will be happy to see him leave, there's great uncertainty in Riyadh about how the next president will deal with them. Both Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump have voiced grave concerns about Saudi Arabia's track record of producing Islamic extremists; Clinton has said she supports the 9/11 lawsuit bill. But while Clinton would likely be a more predictable partner, the Saudis see Trump ? who has called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States ? as a wild card. For now, however, the Saudis are nervously watching Congress to see exactly how unhappy lawmakers are with them. Already, some members of Congress are hinting that they are not comfortable with the 9/11 legislation after all, and that they may consider voting to uphold Obama's veto. Their hesitation comes as a growing number of foreign countries and blocs, including the European Union, voice opposition to the bill. The original bill passed on voice vote in both Houses, making a veto override especially sensitive because members will have to go on the record. And with the presidential election looming, the politics are even more fraught than normal. ?Saudi Arabia has never been an especially popular actor in Washington ? a powerful one, but not popular,"" the former senior U.S. official said. ""And now, nobody in Congress wants to stick their neck out for the Saudis two-and-a-half months before the presidential election.?",0.025854879,0.00500417,0.002502085,0.01000834,0.045037531,0.296080067,0.012510425,2,-1,1
"Ted Cruz is in a bind when it comes to Donald Trump: Loyalists say he should stand by his epic non-endorsement in Cleveland. But Republicans pushing to finally unify the party as the election tightens sayit time for Cruz to get on board. Cruzhasn ruled out an endorsement and is still watching howTrump campaign performs down the homestretch, an aide said. But there is a renewed urgency after his former campaign manager told reporters this week that Cruz is warming toTrump more disciplined campaign. Cruz himself praised Trump for backing the Texassenator crusade to stop a handover of an Internet domain overseer to international regulators. Story Continued Below ?If Ted Cruz wants to call himself a Republican I think he should be at least a part of the team. It looks awfully self-serving for not endorsing Donald Trump at this time,? said Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.). ?You?re on the same team, so youdon sit on the bench and sulk because youdidn get the starting job. If he wants to be called on in the future, he needs to show some character.? ?It would be helpful,? said Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, chairman of the SenateGOP campaign arm. ?If I were in TedCruz position, I would have gone ahead and made the case that of the choices available, Mr. Trump is far and away the best.? Cruz, of course, did exactly the opposite at the Republican convention, drawing boos and jeers from partisans after he urged delegates to ?vote your conscience.? It may have made him enemies among Trump supporters, but it also endeared him to those who have flocked to Cruz and his brand of ?principled conservatism.? Former aides said they would be crushed if Cruz suddenly came around to Trump after taking so much heat and refusing to back down. ?If Cruz's conscience didn't allow him to support Trump at the convention, I don't see any evidence that Trump has changed his behavior to allow Cruz's conscience to support Trump now,? said Amanda Carpenter, a former speechwriter and communications director for Cruz in the Senate. Rick Tyler, who ranCruz press shop during much of his presidential run, said that despite the pressure from Republicans, Cruz will be doneif he endorses Trump. ""There is no negative future stemming from his defense of conservatism speech in Cleveland,? Tyler said in an email. ?Either Trump loses and the speech is cast in a new light; OR Trump wins and is a terrible President and the speech is again cast in a new light; OR Trump wins and is a great president, serves 2 terms and everyone forgets it.? Privately, some Republicans interpreted former campaign manager JeffRoe comments on Wednesday at a Bloomberg event as laying the groundwork for an eventual endorsement of Trump. And hours later, Trump joinedCruz latest legislative effort aimed at keeping U.S. authority over Internet domain names. Cruz offered his appreciation on Twitter for Trump's support, andTrump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway reciprocated with her own appreciation of Cruz. Cruz met privately with vice presidential nominee Mike Pence last week and emerged calling Pence a ?strong conservative.? But Cruzhasn done much else to indicate publicly he'll be voting for Trump over Hillary Clinton. And Cruz is not alone among Senate Republicans: The likes of Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Jeff Flake of Arizona,, Mark Kirk of Illinois, and Dean Heller of Nevada have all either declined to offer an endorsement of anyone or said outright theywon vote for Trump. But none carries the kind of political weight Cruz does ? not to mention the millions of followers. ?Mr. Trump is our nominee and Sen. Cruz represents a big electoral state and is very popular in Texas,? said Texas Rep. Joe Barton. ?It certainly would be helpful, I think, for the Trump campaign to haveCruz endorsement. Cruz has begun to fundraise for his colleagues and transferred $100,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, important bridges toward his colleagues in the cliquey Senate. But some GOP senators said Cruz finds himself caught between a party he wants to lead and a faction of the GOP that would never forgive him, including prominent conservatives like radio host Steve Deace, who said on Wednesday that ""if someone with Cruz's moxie can't hold the line in the GOP it can't be done. So just burn it down""It potentially a no-win situation that Republicans are sympathetic to. ?If you look at the positionhe in,let say Donald Trump wins: Probably not good for Ted Cruz. Donald Trump loses: Probably not good for Ted Cruz,? said a Republican senator. ?It?s a big liability.? Moreover,Cruz potential foe in his 2018 reelection race, Rep. Mike McCaul (R-Texas), spent the week picking atCruz vulnerability on Trump. He said Cruz's position makes him ""very angry."" ?What he did at the convention turned off a lot of people. He pledged to support [Trump]. He broke his word,? McCaul said on the Laura Ingraham show. A month ago, the terrain looked different for Cruz. Trump was lagging behind Clinton and Republicans were preparing for a blowout, making Cruz less culpable for blame given the widespread belief that Trump himself was the problem. But now the election is close and polls show Trump surging in swing states. Republicans sayCruz support could help put Trump over the top and help solidify his position in states that he won in the primary like Colorado, Maine or Wisconsin. On the other hand, a narrow Trump loss could lead to finger-pointing if Cruz doesn't bring on board his supporters. ?I think he wants to part of the team. I thinkhe very bright, I thinkhe capable of really adding something to it. But he also is concerned with being principled in this particular case,? said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.). ?You walk a fine line sometimes.I hopefulwe have a united effort.?",0.035230352,0.0027100270000000003,0.008130080999999999,0.012195122,0.06097561,0.279132791,0.0013550139999999999,2,-1,1

""It's presumptuous for him to make conclusions like that without having thorough conversations with some of the folks who are here on the ground and are really aware of what's going on and what the reasoning is,"" she told CNN's Carol Costello on ""Newsroom.""

" Early on intonight presidential debate Donald Trump himself admitted that he was shedding all pretense of reality in his attacks on Hillary Clinton, replying ?Why not?? in response toClinton sarcastic comment that Mr. Trump might as well ?blame [her] for anythingthat happened ever.? He quickly lived up to his own idiotic remark, most delusionally by claiming that Mrs. Clinton had been ?fighting ISIS for 30 years? despite the fact that ISIS has only existed since 2013. In the real world, the Islamic State was founded in 2013 and only acquired widespread notice with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi?s declaration of a caliphate in June of 2014, three and a half years ago. Since then, of course, Hillary Clinton and the rest of the Obama administration have worked tirelessly to combat the threat of ISIS both in the Middle East and abroad, andAmerica military efforts have resulted in tremendous setbacks for the militant group in terms of both territory lost and fighters killed. So whileTrump suggestion is that Clinton has done nothing against ISIS in thirty years of work, the reality is that she and the Obama administration have dealt a tremendous blow to the group in the few years since it was founded. In an attempt to be generous toTrump lies, it should be noted that the organization currently known as ISIS grew out of the earlier Al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia (AQAM), which was founded in 2004 to fight the American-led invasion and occupation of Iraq. So, at best, ISIS has been around for twelve years, but AQAM, in its alliance with the ideologically distinct Al-Qaeda, was tremendously different than the ISIS of today. To go back 30 years in the history of jihad would take us to 1986, when various jihadist groups in Afghanistan, including those of Osama binLaden, were being funded and trained by RonaldReagan CIA. It was BillClinton administration that first recognized jihadism as a large-scale threat, and his CIA amassed a litany of intelligence on al-Qaeda, all of which was ignored by the Bush administration.Trump claim that ISIS has existed for thirty years demonstrates his shocking ignorance of the most basic elements of global politics, and his underlying claim that Democrats are weakon jihadism is objectively backwards.

"Mexico?s former President, Vicente Fox,isn shy at all about his disdain for Republican nominee Donald Trump ? and he really turned things up a notch after lastnight presidential debate. Anyone who watched the debate (or has access to the internet) knows by now that Trump blew it. His performance was so weak and he was so unprepared, even Republican pundits have admitted that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won by a landslide ? and Foxwasn afraid to point this out. On Tuesday, Fox decided to go after Trump whileit going to hurt the most, knowing full well that the businessmogul ego is likely suffering from embarrassment. On Twitter, Fox teased Trump mercilessly for his horrendous performance, directly asking Trump ?what does losing feel like?? on Twitter. To rub this in even more, Fox posted a screenshot of one ofTrump pathetic fundraising emails, proving to the world thatTrump campaign is still struggling and begging for money: ?@realDonaldTrump you have no shame, I just got another e-mail begging for help.

The attack was brutal:It been awhile since Fox has been in the media for attacking Trump, but he sure knows how to make an appearance. This election cycle, the former President of Mexico has repeatedly made headlines for slamming Trump and publicly stating that Mexico will not pay for his ?f*cking wall.? Fox has also said that Trump ?reminds me of Hitler? and even challenged Trump to a debate once (which Trump was too cowardly to accept). We can only expect that over the next few weeks, Fox is going to support Clinton to the fullest, and do whatever he can to convince Americans not to vote for Trump.

"On an Ohio motorway a semi-truck was seen driving down the road. Most motorist that passed by the truck noticed nothing unusual about the unassuming truck. However, one motorists noticed the words on the back of the truck just below the bumper. The motorist immediately took a photo and posted it online. Now many are less than thrilled to know what was quietly passing through their state. While driving down the highway in Twinsburg, Ohio one driver noticed something on back of a big rig that stood out to him. He immediately took a closer look and saw what the driver had done to his truck's mudflaps. Now Black Lives Matter supporters are furious at the trucker's message, while many other patriots across the country are cheering in support. The picture that the unidentified driver of the truck took was sent and posted to the Ohio Going Blue Facebook page. It didn't take long after the pic was posted for it to go completely viral. The man cleverly chose to through the controversial theme that the Black Lives Matter movement is built on, the idea that only 'black' lives matter. The trucker's message smacked down those entitled blm thugs with his awesome 4-word statement. The truck's mudflaps read ""Without cops, nothing matters."" A very true statement indeed that some of these blm cop-haters should really try to understand. Police do more than just deal out justice to those who break laws. They are the glue that holds together the fabric of society by maintaining order and preventing chaos. Without the protection and watch of our nation's police force many innocents would be robbed of their way of living and lives themselves. It is important to take a step back and realize what these men and women in blue really do for us each and every day. This truck driver obviously gets it and knows that the Black Lives Matter is clearly working their hardest to unravel the order that police have fought so hard to protect.

"There have been so many deaths in country music over the past couple of months, and we thought that we were going to have to say goodbye to another legend Saturday night. It was a normal Saturday night at the Cornstock Concert on the Hill in Garnett, Kansas until Eddie Montgomery collapsed on stage in the middle of his performance. Many of you probably know the country star from the country duo Montgomery Gentry. Montgomery Gentry was founded in 1999 when Eddie Montgomery and Troy Gentry came together and graced us all with their talents. The country duo has released 6 studio albums since their big debut and has had several No. 1 hits such as ?If You Ever Stop Loving Me?, ?Something to Be Proud Of?, ?Lucky Man?, ?Back When I Knew It All? and ?Roll with Me?. The duo rose to fame shortly after the start of their career and they have continued to be a country favorite over the years. The duo was performing at their concert Saturday (September 24th) when Eddie Montgomery collapsed on the stage. The medics immediately rushed to the stage and it was just moments later that he was walking off. The concert continued as Troy Gentry lead the band out. It was just four songs later that Eddie walked back out on the stage and apparently told the audience that he was not feeling well all day and that he was very dehydrated. And just like anything else, rumors started. Fans all over were saying that Eddie had a heart attack right there on stage. Apparently, theyweren listening or theydidn believe that he was actually dehydrated. The next morning on theduo Twitter they announced that Eddie was doing well and that it was definitely not a heart attack. There are false reports floating around that Eddie had a heart attack last night. NOT TRUE. He was dehydrated and returned to the stage. ? Montgomery Gentry (@mgunderground) September 25, 2016 Eddie wanted to reassure everyone that he was indeed alive and that hedidn have a heart attack, so a couple of hours after the initial post he took it upon himself to post a photo of him and his wife. Not only that, but he made sure that all of his fans knew that he was drinking PLENTY of water ? doing his best to prevent the same thing from happening again.

"As news of more frequent police shootings appear in the media. People are asking why is this happening more now than before. Many theories have been proposed. More crime? more drug use.. and so on. There is one that has not been mentioned unitl now. You heard it here first. When did the police shootings begin to increase? Was it in the 2000s..? the teens? Or the 1960s..70s .. 80s or 1990s?? Even during the riotous years of the sixtys there were not as many LEO ..law enforcement officer ..shootings. I recall many years when officers said they had gone an entire career without firing their weapon on duty. A cursory search seems to indicate these shootings began more often from about the late 1980s on to present. That was about the same time an officer Dennis Tueller in Salt Lake City introduced his study on timing of attacks. This has become widely known among LEO departments all across the country as The Tueller Drill. This same drill is also trained in concealed carry classes. How long does it take an attacker to get to you from a standing position? Think about that for a moment, imagine a BG bad guy standing twenty one feet from you. He has a knife or a bat. How long do you think it would take? Tueller found that from about twenty one feet.. it takes an attacker about two seconds, or less to get to you. Two seconds. So beginning in the 1980s LEO depeartments begain to train officers in the Tueller Drill. Bad Guy. Knife. Twenty one feet. No warning signal. You act when he moves toward you. Draw and fire. Now you can see what I believe is one of the arguably biggest reasons for many of the now familiar shootings. This is not to condemn the Tueller drill or LEOs for using it. It is well founded an well reasoned. This is simply to inform why its happening . If anything the burden is on the guy standing in front of an officer.Don charge an officer.

" As Charlotte becomes the latest city to erupt in racial tension, Massachusetts' highest court ruled this week that just because a black suspect flees police, it does not necessarily signify guilt. The court pointed to statistics in a recent Boston Police Department report that revealed that ""black men in the City of Boston were more likely to be targeted for police-civilian encounters such as stops, frisks, searches, observations and interrogations."" The case at issue concerned Jimmy Warren, who was stopped in December 2011 by a Boston police officer responding to a break in that had occurred in the neighborhood. Responding police officer Christopher R. Carr saw Warren and a friend and called out, ""Hey fellas."" Warren turned and ran up a hill into a park and Carr observed him clutching the right side of his pants. Carr lost sight of Warren, but eventually caught up with him in the backyard of a house. Carr drew his weapon and yelled for him to get down. After a struggle, Carr arrested Warren and found no gun on his person. Minutes after the arrest police recovered a Walther .22 caliber firearm in the front yard. Warren told the officer that he did not have a license to carry a firearm and he was later charged with unlawful possession. Nelson P. Lovins, brought the case to the state's high court after Warren lost below. Lovins argued that police did not have the reasonable suspicion to issue a stop, and the gun evidence had to be suppressed. He argued that the police pursued his client with the intent of questioning him, but they lacked the basis to do so. ""My client was never charged with a break in -- only with illegal possession of a gun, "" Lovins said in an interview. The court ruled in Warren's favor, noting that a stop has to be grounded in an officers' ""reasonable suspicion"" that the person was involved with a crime. That suspicion, the court said, had to be grounded in ""specific, articulable facts."" ""We are not persuaded that the information available to the police at the time of the seizure was sufficiently specific to establish reasonable suspicion that the defendant was connected to the breaking and entering under investigation,"" the court held, then walking through all of the factors the police had considered including the description of the suspects, the proximity to the crime, and the fact that Warren had run. On the last factor, the court pointed out a ""cautionary note"" pointing to statistics specific to Boston. The court warned that a reasonable suspicion calculus ""cannot be divorced from the finding in a recent Boston Police Department report documenting a pattern of racial profiling"" of black males in the city. The court said it did not eliminate flight as a factor for the reasonable suspicion analysis whenever a black male is the subject of an investigatory stop, but in those circumstances ""flight is not necessarily probative of a suspect's state of mind or consciousness of guilt."" ""Rather, the finding that black males in Boston are disproportionately and repeatedly targeted"" the Court said, ""suggests a reason for flight totally unrelated to consciousness of guilt."" Lovins hopes that this case will influence trial judges down the road that just because a black man is fleeing that doesn't necessarily mean he is guilty. ""We've demonstrated that there are other reasons for flight, certainly in the case of black males who have been targeted for stops and searches disproportionally,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Boston Police Department issued a statement saying the court's decision was ""very troubling."" ""For it to consider studies that were never introduced into evidence or offered into the record is concerning,"" the statement said, ""At the very least the court should have heard from experts who compiled and analyzed the data."" Matthew Segal, the legal director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, says that the police and prosecutors invited the data into the discussions because they are the ones who asserted that flight was automatically suspicious. The ACLU used the same statistics from the Boston Police Department to conclude that black people and communities in Boston were not being treated the same as white people in white communities. ""This is a potentially huge decision,"" said Segal. ""The Black Lives Matter movement can change the law in this country, if more courts follow the lead of the Supreme Judicial Court and look at the reasonableness standard from the perspective of the civilian.

"Story highlights Trump has insisted for months that he cannot release his tax returns because he is under audit In 2012, Reid, without proof, accused Romney of going a decade without paying federal income taxes (CNN) It's becoming an election year tradition: Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid is hammering away at the Republican presidential nominee on his taxes. Reid took to the Senate floor Wednesday, taunting and ridiculing Donald Trump for not disclosing his tax returns. The reason for Trump's refusal is simple, Reid said. ""Because Trump's tax returns would further destroy his presidential candidacy,"" said Reid, who made Mitt Romney's tax returns a major election issue four years ago. Trump has insisted for months that he cannot release his tax returns because he is under audit by the Internal Revenue Service; alternatively, his campaign has said that voters do not much care about the issue. It is not a requirement for presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns, but it is an enduring tradition. For the last 40 years, virtually every major party nominee has released his or her tax returns. (Gerald Ford released a summary in 1976.)

The Donald claims to be going through some unspecified auditcausing him to postpone, also making the case that his supportersdon really care about his tax returns.That exactly what Kimmel wanted to put to the test, whether his supporters would bat an eyelash in their blind support no matter what the tax returns said. So, in order to see if Trump supporters would care at all about the content ofTrump tax return, the Kimmel team came up with a bunch of controversial questions to ask about a made up tax return filed by Trump that had just come out. ?Was it legitimate for Donald Trump to write off his many marriages as ?entertainment?? What do you think of Donald Trump listing his primary occupation as ?farmer?? What do you think of Donald Trump donating $50,000 to SubwayJared Legal Defense Fund??

"Kansas is bleeding money and jobs and Governor Sam Brownbackdoesn want the people to know how devastating his economic policies have been. In 2011, the Tea Party governor was so confident that his economic policy of massive tax cuts for the wealthy and reduced spending would turn Kansas into an economic powerhouse that he created a special group charged with writing reports on the results. ButBrownback experiment has failed so spectacularly that the state is billions of dollars in debt, education funding is suffering, and job growth is pathetic. So pathetic that Kansas is losing more jobs than it has gained. In January, Brownbackcouldn handle a report put together by his group that admitted ?Kansas sometimes was faring worse than it had before Brownback became governor,? so he made every effort to cover it up. In other words, he censored it because his group was supposed to report that the economy is soaring, not falling to the ground like a rock. Kansas Center for Economic Growth executive director Heidi Holliday blasted Brownback for killing the report. ?He specifically asked the council to hold him accountable through rigorous performance metrics. Five years later, the metrics clearly show his tax experiment has failed while business leaders and local chambers of commerce across the state openly ask him to change course.? In fact, Brownback is so desperate to keep the people of Kansas from calling for tarring and feathering him in a public square that he is turning to the federal government. Instead of writing their own independent reports, the group is now restricted to getting their information from the Federal Reserve, which conservatives often claim is responsible whenever economic issues occur. That particularly surprised Kansas House Minority Leader Tom Burroughs, who was quick to point out the irony. ?The missed revenue marks, missed job reports, missed projections shed light on his failed policies. I kind of find it a little ironic they chose to go to a federal government report after they blamed President Obama for our economic problems.? GovernorBrownback economic experiment is a complete failure and a joke. Kansas? economy is now in shambles and Republicans have no one to blame but themselves. They believed that by implementing an extreme conservative fiscal policy without interference from Democrats that they would prove trickle-down economics as a total success. Instead, it failed miserably and now they want to censor any results from being reported. By all rights, Brownback should have ousted by voters in 2014. But now Kansas is stuck with him and his failed policies for at least another two years. Meanwhile, the wealthy are laughing all the way to the bank.

"In the wake of the recent rioting and looting in NC, officers at one Charlotte police station were in for a heck of a shock when a little black boy came stumbling into the station totally unannounced. Even before the child had a chance to speak a word, one officer quickly called over her fellow officers in the station and rushed towards the boy. The horrifying episode for this young boy all started when he was woken up by sirens and helicopters from outside during the riots on Tuesday. The riots were happening just outside the boy's window, but naturally he was completely unaware of why any of this was happening, or even what was really happening. The next day, on the way to school, the boy's mother, Deanna Hooker was playing the radio and the two heard a news report about how several officers were injured in the rioting and attacks. Deanna had no idea how much the riots and news of the injured officers had really affected her son. After seeing so much hate in the news in and his surrounding community Deanna was rather surprised to hear her son's idea. The boy thought about the riots for days and the impact that they had on him and continued to have on him. He wanted to make an impact himself for those who risk their lives to keep him safe. ""He asked me if he could bring the police donuts and give them hugs for all they do,"" Deanna's Facebook post read that was later shared by Love What Matters. With a little help from his mom he was able to carry out this very kind and meaningful gesture. He wore a sign around his neck that read, ""Free hugs,"" and carried in a big donut box. Deanna's son walked into the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department and gave the officers his two gifts. He didn't just tell one officer about how he felt, he made sure to go around to every single officer to tell them how he felt about the service they do for him and his mother. ""It is amazing how much children can teach us during times like this,"" Deanna's post said about her amazing son. This mom should be proud of her son for having such a steady view in such a chaotic world. She deserves some credit as well for having instilled such great values in her amazing son.

"Donald Trump is calling for one of the most controversial and racially charged policies enacted by police departments to be expanded across the entire country. The city of New York recently ended ?stop and frisk,? but Trump is pushing for it, apparently egged on by his top campaign surrogate, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. From Politico: In a pre-taped interview on Fox News scheduled to air Wednesday night, Trump was asked by an audience member what he would do to address ?violence in the black community? and ?black-on-black crime.? Trump responded by proposing that ?stop-and-frisk? policing, in which an officer is empowered to stop an individual and frisk them for weapons or any other illegal contraband, be adopted nationwide. ?I would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically,? Trump told the questioner. Stop-and-frisk was repeatedly called out and protested against by New York City residents because the policy was shown time and time again to disproportionately target black and Latino residents. They were singled out for examination and interrogation by police officers, in what some felt were quotas set up by police management. When the city stopped using stop-and-frisk, they did not see an increase in crime, despite claims from its supporters that there would be a spike in criminal activity. Most people who had been subject to stop-and-frisk were let go, because theyhadn done anything wrong. Former US District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin, who had ruled the procedure unconstitutional in federal court, described it as destructivein an interview with Buzzfeed. She added: ?In short, the overstopping in many communities harmed the relationship between the people and the police. Cooperation has now improved due to positive efforts by police to work with the community not against it.?

"The first presidential debate was Monday andlet just say that Donald Trump had a very bad night. One of the GOPcandidate easiest lies to expose was his insistence that ?stop and frisk?wasn ruled unconstitutional.He wrong, it absolutely was. Debate moderator Lester Holt asked Trump about his recent arguments in favor of ?stop and frisk? and mentioned that the court has declared the practice unconstitutional on the grounds that it is discriminatory. ??Stop and frisk? was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men ? ?

It shows us just what that kind of war does to a society, to ordinary people, and children just like us, just like the kids in our own lives. Well, there is one person who is completely unmoved by these images: Donald Trump Jr. TheDonald mini me has long shown his lack of humanity. After all, he made a disgusting Holocaust reference when trying to tear down themedia coverage of Hillary Clinton, saying if the GOP did what the Democrats are doing,they be ?warming up the gas chamber.? Well, now,he gone into the gutter again, this time regarding Syrian refugees. Trump Jr sent out the following tweet, comparing refugees to a bowl of Skittles: This image says it all.

"Story highlights Trump on Tuesday defended calling former Miss Universe Alicia Machado ""Miss Piggy"" back in the 1990s House Republicans gave Trump mixed reviews Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan dodged Tuesday when asked about Donald Trump's criticism of a former Miss Universe, trying instead to put the focus on Hillary Clinton following the first presidential debate. Trump on Fox News Tuesday defended making critical remarks about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado's weight gain back in the 1990s. The Republican nominee said she had ""gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem."" Ryan, who has been critical of Trump's comments in the past, did not bite on this one, however. ""I'm not going to get into the who said what this morning on a talk show because I didn't see it,"" Ryan said. ""I think this debate, I think people, met their expectations, and I think Hillary gave a very polished, well-rehearsed status quo defense and I think Donald Trump gave a unique Donald Trump response to the status quo,"" Ryan added.

"United Nations  President Barack Obama took to the most prominent international stage Tuesday to deliver a stark warning to American voters of the dire global consequences they face should they embrace isolationism and ultra-nationalism in November. Never mentioning Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump by name, the President's final address to the United Nations General Assembly was at heart an impassioned rebuke of the GOP candidate's policies on trade, immigration and multiculturalism -- and a defense of liberalism and tolerance -- delivered 49 days before votes are cast for his replacement. He painted a dark picture of the future awaiting Americans, and the world, if the forces of ""aggressive nationalism"" or ""crude populism"" win out. And he specifically inveighed against building a wall -- a centerpiece of Trump's proposal on border security. ""A nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself,"" Obama declared to the assembled representatives of the UN's member states. Gone were Obama's idealistic appeals to bring about a world free of nuclear weapons and an agenda focused on peace, as were his previous UN addresses. The ""hope and change"" of his argument as a presidential candidate himself was also replaced by exhortations against a future filled with chaos. JUST WATCHED President Obama at the UN: Then and now Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH President Obama at the UN: Then and now 01:45 ""Time and again human beings have believed they finally arrived at a period of enlightenment, only to repeat cycles of conflict and suffering. Perhaps that's our fate,"" Obama suggested. ""We have to remember the choices of individual human beings led to repeated world war,"" Obama said. ""Each of us as leaders, each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best. For we have shown that we can choose a better history."" He pointed to growing divisions and discontent at home that challenge those decisions, and noted that the shortcomings of globalization had created ""an uncertainty and unease and strife"" that required acknowledgement, but not turning inward. ""I believe that at this moment we all face a choice,"" Obama said. ""We can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration or we can retreat into a world sharply divided and ultimately in conflict along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion. I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward and not back."" It was Obama's eighth and final address to the UN body, which enthusiastically welcomed him in 2009 after he moved to reverse the unilateral approach of his predecessor George W. Bush. In his speech that year, Obama vowed to work within international bodies to confront the world's crises while pushing an agenda combating climate change and nuclear non-proliferation. But in the intervening years, the harsh realities of diplomacy settled in, both for Obama and the UN. The organization's inability to stem suffering in Syria and Ukraine laid bare the continued struggles to combat breaches of international law, while Obama's own work toward combating violent extremists has failed to stop terrorist groups from committing atrocities. Obama's address Tuesday reflected those realities. He drew titters from the collection of world leaders and diplomats in the high-ceilinged General Assembly hall when he noted that ""at times both America's adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems were either caused by Washington or could be solved by Washington. And perhaps too many in Washington believe that, as well."" He made scant mention of individual world flash points, choosing instead to offer a more thematic recap of his foreign agenda. ""The world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before. And yet our societies are filled with uncertainty and unease and strife,"" Obama said. ""Despite enormous progress, as people lose trust in institutions, governing becomes more difficult and tensions between nations become more quick to surface."" Obama continued his tradition at the UN of acknowledging areas where the US has fallen short in its practice of democracy, saying his country and other developed nations must set a better example for emerging democracies. Citing the pervasive role of money in politics, entrenched party allegiances and a patchwork of voting laws, Obama said it was up to long-established nations to show the way forward. ""Those of us who believe in democracy, we need to speak out forcefully. Because both the facts and history is on our side,"" Obama said. ""We better strive harder to set a better example at home."" Obama used his own efforts to help revive a stalled economy as an example of US leadership during his tenure, saying other countries would be wise to follow his lead of going after corruption and unfair tax policies. He also cited the deal with Iran to curtain its nuclear program, and reopening of ties with Cuba and Myanmar, as examples of a successful global approach. But the array of places where Obama's approach hasn't yielded the outcomes he projected during his first appearance here in 2009 were also unavoidable. That includes his inability to negotiate peace between Israel and the Palestinians -- a major topic in his first four UN addresses that was entirely absent during last year's speech. This year, the President took issue with both sides' actions toward one another. He criticized Israeli settlements, saying the only path to Mideast peace will come when the two sides reconcile deeply held differences. Palestinians must ""reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel,"" Obama said. But he also said peace won't come until ""Israel recognizes it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land."" Obama plans to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday to ""discuss the need for genuine advancement of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the face of deeply troubling trends on the ground,"" according to White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. JUST WATCHED Official: UN to suspend aid to Syria Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Official: UN to suspend aid to Syria 00:58 Another persisting crisis -- Russia's continued incursion into Ukraine -- also drew Obama's attention Tuesday. ""In a world that left the age of empire behind, we see Russia attempting to recover lost glory through force,"" Obama said. ""If Russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors, it may be popular at home. It may fuel nationalist fervor for a time. Over time, it's also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less secure."" Indeed, many of his harshest warnings were aimed at global government practices that damage democracy and liberalism and called for the rejection of strongmen, authoritarian and tribalism. ""There appears to be growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now,"" he told the assembled leaders. ""And I want everybody to understand, I am not neutral in that contest.""",0.024479803999999997,0.0036719709999999996,0.00244798,0.011015912,0.047735618,0.29620563,0.009791922,2,-1,1
" Legendary journalist Dan Rather took to Facebook to give his two cents ontonight debate, and his response is a devastating indictment of Republican nominee DonaldTrump atrocious behavior and obvious inability to stay within the realm of factual reality. Praising Clinton for maintaining her composure in the face ofTrump aggressive interruptions, he tore into Trump for attempting to force our political atmosphere into a post-truth era and for repudiating the noble values of pluralism and tolerance that our nation was founded on. Ladies and gentlemen, whatever civility once existed in our politics is tonight officially dead. Never in the history of televised debates have we witnessed such a show. Andthat what the Donald wanted. A show. He got it, but will he be seen as the hero or the villain? If you are a fan of Hillary Clinton, I suspect you are thrilled with her poised and confident performance. Perhaps her crowning line was ?I prepared for this debate andI prepared to be President?. If you are a fan of Donald Trump, his quarrelsome, no-holds-barred approach, often facts be damned, will likely in turn have thrilled you. The question is what does everybody else watching think and how many impressionable voters remain? Taking a snapshot of the debate stage this evening, two candidates behind podiums, each representing one of the major political parties, it would seem to be the latest chapter in our quadrennial dance with democracy. But experiencing the event, in sound and motion, it was of course anything but. From the very beginning, the body language tonight was striking. HIllary Clinton, the first woman ever to be on this stage was calm and substantive. Donald Trump interrupted often and slouched and sneered as he turned to address her. This is whatTrump fans like about him, playing the alpha male at all costs. Clinton seemed completely unflustered, which is what her fans love about her. How this all plays to the majority of viewers and voters at home will be in the eyes of the beholder. But I was surprised by how much this man who has made so much of the means of television spent not looking into the camera, but preoccupied with his adversary. Trump came across as amped, a pacing tiger ready to pounce on every answer. His Interruptions suggests little regard to the rules.He itching for afight to swing wildly. Clinton was clearly the policy expert, nimbly jumping from topic to topic, policy to policy. But she was also much more able to paint a big picture than I have seen in times past. I thought she was particularly effective on the issue of race and especially the birther lie against President Obama. She had the facts on her side, but also it was an effective appeal to fire up her base. In the end, more than all of the specifics, I was struck by how unprecedented was the overall tenor ? matching that of the campaign. We once held certain truths to be ?self-evident? ? that ?all men are created equal? and ?they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.? These were the lofty ideals that served as a rallying cry for the founders of these United States to choose liberty over tyranny. The man who wrote these words, Thomas Jefferson, and his compatriots were imperfect and in some cases deeply flawed men. Yet their idealism fixed a North Star in our democratic firmament that has guided our ship of state ever since, with some very noted moral detours. Now I fear that the tide of progress is rapidly receding with the fierce undertow of a looming tsunami. Our Founders believed in reason and the power of intellect. Donald Trump made clear tonight by his wilful ignorance of important issues that he does not. Our founders feared the accumulation of power, they loathed vanity, and tried to build in protections against the demagogues who would appeal tomankind basest instincts. Donald Trump relishes in all of these impulses. For him they are instinctual and a prescription for success. To call Trump a con man, as many have, is a disservice to the art of the con. By its definition a con requires deceit. But Trump has not tried to hide his lies or the sheer unrealistic audacity of his cartoonish policy positions. He has asked the American people to bet on him. The fact checkers will certainly weigh in. The pundits will have their say. But the voters have all the information they need. The judgement is in their ? or more accurately our ? hands.",0.037974684,0.006329114,0.004219409,0.014767932,0.048523207,0.293248945,0.002109705,1,-1,1

"Jeffrey DeLaurentis will serve as America's ambassador to the communist-led country. | Getty Obama nominates ambassador to Cuba in long-shot move When it comes to picking fights with Republicans over Cuba, Barack Obama has apparently decided he's only a lame-duck, second-term president once. The president announced Tuesday that he has nominated Jeffrey DeLaurentis, the top U.S. diplomat currently serving in Cuba, to serve as America's official ambassador to the communist-led country. Story Continued Below The move is sure to draw howls of protest from some hard-core opponents of the Cuban government, including Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, who have vowed to block any ambassador nomination for Cuba. Still, Obama's decision suggests he's willing to take on the risk of a dragged-out fight over a topic ? Cuba-U.S. relations ? that has increasing bipartisan support. The island nation restored diplomatic ties with the U.S. in July 2015 after more than 50 years of hostility, and Obama considers America's new relationship with Cuba one of his signature foreign policy achievements. DeLaurentis is a career member of the U.S. foreign service who has been the chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in Havana since it was re-established in 2015 and headed what was an American interests section there before that. He was widely believed to be the frontrunner for the ambassador's job should Obama select a nominee. ""The appointment of an ambassador is a common sense step forward toward a more normal and productive relationship between our two countries,"" Obama said in a statement announcing his decision. Among those appaluding Obama's decision was Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who has long advocated for better U.S.-Cuba relations. ""Americans traveling & doing business in #Cuba will be well-served by the prompt confirmation of Jeff DeLaurentis to serve as US ambassador,"" Flake tweeted. But although a growing number of Republicans have shown support for deepening ties to Cuba, it takes only a single senator to severely slow down a nomination process for an ambassador. Asked by POLITICO earlier this year whether he still held firm to his denouncement of the rapprochement with Cuba and his vow to block an ambassador confirmation, Rubio said yes. ""A U.S. ambassador is not going to influence the Cuban government, which is a dictatorial, closed regime,? the senator, who is of Cuban descent, said as the one-year anniversary of Cuba-U.S. ties loomed. Rubio's office subsequently issued a statement assailing the nomination. ""This nomination,"" Rubio said, ""should go nowhere until the Castro regime makes significant and irreversible progress in the areas of human rights and political freedom for the Cuban people.""",0.025236592999999998,0.0,0.0,0.0031545740000000003,0.047318612,0.258675079,0.0,2,-1,1
"Washington  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz concluded months of animosity between him and Donald Trump on Friday by saying he will vote for the GOP nominee. But between the party-line camaraderie that Friday brought and the ""bromance"" from the initial stretch of the election, the two bitterly battled it out for the nomination. Here are some of the more notable -- and inflammatory -- salvos the two exchanged while on the campaign trail. 'Lyin' Ted' The attack Trump most frequently deployed against Cruz was the nickname the real estate mogul turned politician used to describe his competition: ""Lyin' Ted."" Trump routinely dropped that moniker on Cruz. Candidates' spouses take the heat In an election season defined by vicious and often personal attacks, not even the candidates' wives were safe, evidenced by Trump's tweet about Cruz's wife , Heidi Cruz. The March spat came after a Facebook advertisement targeted to Mormons showed an old photo of Trump's wife, Melania, posing nude. The ad, however, was produced by an anti-Trump super PAC, which had no known connection to the Cruz campaign. Trump, however, didn't see a difference. ""Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!"" Trump tweeted in March. Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife! ? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2016 As for Heidi's ""beans,"" Trump never spilled them, much less described what he was referring to. 'A sniveling coward' Cruz's irate response was predictable -- even if his choice of words was not. ""Donald, you're a sniveling coward and leave Heidi the hell alone,"" Cruz told reporters in Wisconsin, pointing his finger at the cameras for emphasis. Trump links Cruz's father to Lee Harvey Oswald Heidi was not the only Cruz family member to be called out by Trump. ""(Ted Cruz's) father, you know, was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's, you know, being shot. I mean the whole thing is ridiculous,"" Trump said in an interview on ""Fox and Friends"" the day of the Indiana primary in May. ""I mean what was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald, shortly before the death? Before the shooting? It's horrible."" No other news outlets corroborated the claim that Rafael Cruz knew of the John F. Kennedy assassin. 'A pathological liar' During a May press conference , Cruz's attacks against Trump hit a new level when he called Trump a ""pathological liar,"" ""utterly amoral,"" ""a narcissist at a level I don't this country's ever seen"" and ""a serial philanderer."" The strong rhetoric came after the accusations Trump made about Cruz's father and shortly before the crucial Indiana primary contest -- which Cruz lost, ending his candidacy. Cruz's lack of endorsement at the RNC Cruz showed the hard feelings hadn't subsided two months later at the Republican National Convention, when he blatantly undercut Trump with a lack of endorsement during his turn at the lectern. Cruz personally told Trump he would not be offering him an endorsement during his speech, instead encouraging voters to ""vote your conscience"" -- earning boos from an audience hoping for party unity. Trump didn't want Cruz's endorsement, anyway Asked about the snub, Trump said he didn't want it, anyway. ""If he gives it, I will not accept it,"" Trump said at a news conference at the end of the convention. A new Canadian prime minister? In January, Trump tweeted a fallback plan for Cruz in case his presidential dreams fell short, suggesting Cruz could be the Canadian prime minister , a jab at questions over Cruz's eligibility to be president due to his Canadian birthplace. Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister. ? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 23, 2016 'Pathetic' Kasich and Cruz band together When Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- a pair Trump once called ""the leftovers"" as they were his last challengers in the primary fight -- made an attempt to divide the map to stop Trump, the mogul didn't mince words about his view of the maneuver. ""Actually I was happy, because it shows how weak they are, it shows how pathetic they are,"" Trump said. Trump accuses Cruz of stealing the Iowa caucuses After Cruz came out victorious during the Iowa caucuses, Trump accused Cruz of committing fraud and stealing the win. ""Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified,"" Trump tweeted in February.

" A trail of clues provided by a Washington Post reporter and his readers led Univision anchor Enrique Acevedo to Donald Trump's shimmering golf resort outside Miami earlier this week. There, Acevedo found something that has elicited both shock and mystery within the political world: a portrait of Trump that the Republican nominee reportedly paid for using money from his charitable foundation. ""A lot of people have been looking for this painting,"" Acevedo wrote Wednesday. The search was prompted by David Fahrenthold, the Washington Post reporter who has been investigating the Trump Foundation. In a story published Tuesday , Fahrenthold reported that the real estate mogul had used money from the Trump Foundation to purchase a $10,000, four-foot-tall acrylic painting of himself at a charity fundraiser. Fahrenthold had already reported that Trump used the foundation's money to buy another portrait of himself , one that was six-feet-tall and cost $20,000. Experts say each purchase was possibly illegal. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Following the report Tuesday, an eagle-eyed Twitter follower notified Fahrenthold that a photo on TripAdvisor showed the portrait hanging at the Trump National Doral Resort near Miami. The resort happens to be mere blocks from Univision's studios. Acevedo, who said he's been following Fahrenthold's reporting for weeks, reserved a room late Tuesday night at the hotel using points from his personal credit card. ""I didn't want to give Univision's money to one of Trump's businesses,"" he said. Acevedo eventually located the painting at the entrance of the Champions Bar & Grill insider the resort, marking the latest triumph in Fahrenthold's intrepid and collaborative reporting. ""I consider it a very small contribution to David's phenomenal reporting,"" Acevedo told CNN in an email. Fahrenthold, for his part, disagrees. ""Enrique deserves 99.9 percent of the credit for that find, since it was he who figured out how to get on the property (by booking a room), and then how to find the photo itself,"" he told CNN in an email. Fahrenthold's reporting was cited in a speech last week by President Barack Obama, who compared the Clinton family foundation with Trump's foundation. ""One candidate's family foundation has saved countless lives around the world,"" Obama said. ""The other candidate's foundation took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a six-foot-tall painting of himself."" When he learned of the President's comment, Fahrenthold put in another request to his readers. ""Reminder,"" he tweeted, ""I am still looking for this portrait."" The next day, he had a lead from a Washington Post reader who had shipped the painting to another one of Trump's golf clubs in Briarcliff Manor, New York. ""This all happened because of social media,"" Fahrenthold told CNN in the email, saying he hoped the TripAdvisor photo would motivate a Florida reporter to track it down. ""Enrique did just that -- although, it turns out, I had underestimated how much work this would actually take,"" he said.",0.050397878,0.00265252,0.00795756,0.00795756,0.09549071599999999,0.270557029,0.0,2,-1,1
"Story highlights The Obama administration's refugee resettlement policy has been accused of posing security risks The US is planning on accepting more refugees next year Washington (CNN) A spokesman for the State Department acknowledged in a recent interview there's ""potential"" for ISIS terrorists to infiltrate refugee camps in the Middle East, but stood by the rigor of US vetting standards for refugees. ""I wouldn't debate the fact that there's the potential for ISIS terrorists to try to insert themselves,"" John Kirby said on ""Fox and Friends"" Wednesday. ""And we've seen that in some of the refugee camps in Jordan and in Turkey where they'll try to insert themselves into the population."" The acknowledgment comes amid criticism the Obama administration's refugee resettlement policy poses security risks to the US, a charge made often by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on the campaign trail.

"Sen. ChuckSchumer money could give Democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in Florida and Ohio. | Getty Schumer transfers millions to Dems in bid for Senate takeover Chuck Schumer is sitting on a mountain of cash. And nowhe starting to dole it out to fellow Democrats who might make him majority leader. The New York senator is transferring $1 million to the Senate Democrats? campaign arm on Tuesday.He also given $3.2 million to state parties over the past week, Democratic sources said. Story Continued Below Earlier this month, Schumer shifted an additional $2 million from his campaign war chest to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Altogether in September, Schumer has transferred $6.2 million of the $27 million he has on hand to help Democratic hopefuls. Republicans control 54 seats, but Democrats are favored to win three back, so control of the chamber is seen as a toss-up. As the party begins making difficult decisions about where to spend and where to cut, a significant transfer from Schumer could go a long way. ?The Kochs do not have a finite amount of money, they have unlimited money. We have a finite amount of money,? said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in an interview on Monday. ?We?re just trying to allocate our resources sothey meaningful to us and our candidates.?Schumer money could give Democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in Florida and Ohio and eye instead cheaper races in North Carolina and Missouri. No one has more to gain from a Democratic takeover of the Senate than Schumer, who will ascend to the leader job in 2017 as Reid retires after a 12-year stint as party head.Schumer donation is both a vote of confidence in hisparty candidates and a reflection of Democrats? future challenges. Democrats are defending 25 seats in 2018 compared with just eight GOP seats, so if Democrats come up short in November they are unlikely to take back the majority this decade. Schumer has also raised $2 million directly for candidates? committees, and a joint account that he leads has collected $800,000 combined for the DSCC and individual candidates.He planning a fall event in New York to benefit Senate candidatesthat projected to bring in ?upwards of another million,? according to a person close to the New York senator. ?Schumer has been relentless,? said a DSCC official. Schumer and Reid have also appeared at numerous events for Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC backing Democratic Senate hopefuls run by former aides to Reid, including his onetime chief of staff, Susan McCue. The group, which can accept unlimited donations from donors, has spent more than $30 million this cycle. Democrats complain that Republican super PACs have far outspent them. ?Leader Reid and Senator Schumer are working around the clock to raise awareness about the avalanche of money Republicans are pouring into Senate races through independent expenditures. The amounts are staggering,? McCue said in a statement. Schumer still will have roughly $20 million on hand after the transfer. He is up for reelection in New York, with the latest polls showing him trouncing his GOP challenger by more than 40 points. However, if past is prologue, Schumer is likely to spend some money on it despite token opposition. Schumer spent about $13 million in 2010, but that was a historically bad year for Democrats.Schumer colleagueswon rule out the possibility thathe donate more to hisparty Senate takeover effort. ?If he thinks it will make a difference,he do it.He very calculating,? said a Democratic senator. ?Chuck will be there if you need him.? Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), a close ally of Schumer, agreed that the presumptive Democratic leader might provide more. ?He?s going to watch everything closely.It my sensehe 1,000 percent committed to taking back the Senate,? Stabenow said.There no decision yet on where the DSCC might allocate the additional money from Schumer. It could go toward races in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania or Nevada, states that are all exceedingly close, or help compete in pricey Florida. Using the cash in red-leaning states is another option. ?We?re going to make some tough decisions, whichhaven been made yet,? Reid said. The National Republican Senatorial Committee has been outraised by the DSCC to the tune of $36 million. Outside groups like the Senate Leadership Fund are making up the difference, but Republican officials are leaning on their rank and file to help fill the campaign coffers, with McConnell coming up with nearly $4 million in transfers thus far. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) made a big splash with a $2 million transfer, but even though he has millions more on hand, Thune saidhe need to hang on to the rest of his cash. ?Idon think I can probably keep pace with Schumer,? Thune said in an interview. Republicans are now trying to wring every last bit out of their members, after Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama spurned transferring any of his $10 million. Now the GOP hopes that NRSC Vice Chairs Dean Heller of Nevada and Tom Cotton of Arkansas may make a last-minute transfer. They have yet to give money directly to the group, GOP sources said, though they have helped raise funds directly for the NRSC. The third vice chair Joni Ernst of Iowa gave last week, an aide said Tuesday morning. Republicans, however, simplydon have their own Chuck Schumer. Instead, they are relying on a tightening presidential race, deep-pocketed outside groups and candidates who are running far ahead of Trump to eke out a win. ?He?s a machine,? Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas said of Schumer, his workout partner. But ?it may not make a difference,? the Texan added.",0.028050491,0.001402525,0.001402525,0.01542777,0.040673212,0.23983169699999998,0.007012623000000001,2,-1,1

And to reminding an increasingly out-of-touch and compromised set of representatives that they are answerable to the people they were hired to serve.?It clear in the video that Donald Trump must be defeated for the good of all humanity, so it makes absolute sense that Whedon would use those who have played superheroes in his movies to get this very important message across.It absolutely important that we all vote, not only for president, but also for legislators all the way down to the local level.

Mike Pence told a church group here Thursday that there is ""far too much of this talk of institutional bias or racism within law enforcement"" during a conversation about faith. Pence was answering a question posed by Bishop John Brannon who asked about how Pence as vice president could personally unite the nation. Pence referenced recent police shootings of black men in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina, saying, ""It's a very troubling time for us."" The Charlotte shootings, which led to violence and unrest in that city this week, have sparked discussions of lethal police force against African-Americans. Pence mentioned faith as his first means to reunite the country and reduce violence, but then said he thought there was too much talk of how law enforcement officers conduct themselves. ""Donald Trump and I believe there's been far too much of this talk of institutional bias or racism within law enforcement. That police officers are human beings.

"On Wednesday, the Senate is expected to override President Obama's veto, for the first time, on a bill that would allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia. So how exactly does a veto override work? The rules are described in Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution. When the president rejects a bill, he is required to return it, along with his objections, to the chamber in which the bill originated. Then, the members of that chamber ""shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it."" In other words, the president sends vetoed Senate bills back to the Senate to reconsider first and vetoed House bills back to the House to reconsider first. In this case, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, began in the Senate, so the Senate votes first. Both the House and the Senate require a two-thirds majority to successfully override a president's veto. Both chambers also require the ""yeas and nays"" to be counted. In the House, the members vote using the electronic voting system and in the Senate they take a roll call vote, in which eachsenator name is called by the clerk. Though the Senate received PresidentObama veto message on Friday,they not voting on it until Wednesday. This is common, according to the Congressional Research Service, because it gives senators time to work out the terms under which they will reconsider the vetoed bill, including the amount of debate time on the Senate floor. Then, when the vetoed bill comes up for a vote, the presiding officer of that chamber states, ""Shall the bill pass, the objections of the President of the United States to the contrary notwithstanding?"" While some Senate Democrats and Republicans have concerns that the JASTA bill would open the United States up to similar legal retaliation from other foreign nations and tarnish its relationship with Saudi Arabia, a key Middle East ally, the veto override is expected to easily garner the two-thirds votes needed to pass. Assuming it clears the Senate, the JASTA veto override will then head to the House, where the same voting process will ensue. If the veto override is successful in the House and the Senate, the bill will become law because two-thirds of both chambers have agreed to pass the bill despite the president's objection.",0.022556391000000002,0.0,0.0037593979999999997,0.007518797,0.026315789,0.304511278,0.0037593979999999997,2,-1,1
"""I would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to complete negotiations so we can advance this important matter,"" Sen. Mitch McConnell said. | Getty McConnell punts budget vote to buy time for deal Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delayed a procedural vote on a must-pass government spending measure Monday as top lawmakers remained at odds over a handful of provisions in the bill, even with a months-long impasse over Zika funding largely resolved. The key vote is now scheduled for 2:15 p.m. Tuesday, McConnell said ? giving negotiators more time to hammer out the fine print of the continuing resolution that will keep the federal government funded until Dec. 9. For now, however, sources said negotiators have settled on language that would provide money to battle the Zika virus while allowing PlannedParenthood partner clinic in Puerto Rico to access the federal grants ? a provision that had been a major point of contention. Story Continued Below ?Senate Republicans stand ready to move forward,? McConnell (R-Ky.) said Monday. ?I would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to complete negotiations so we can advance this important matter.? McConnell spent about five minutes huddling with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) on Monday afternoon as they sought to strike a deal that would allow the Senate to recess as soon as the end of the week. But the tentative resolution on Zika funding sets aside, for now, one of the toughest sticking points in the short-term spending measure. Senate Democrats had repeatedly filibustered a standalone Zika bill over restrictions that barred Planned Parenthood ? particularly Profamilias, the health careprovider partner in Puerto Rico ? from the federal funds. But in the CR, the Puerto Rico clinic would have access to the money, which would come through a $95 million social services block grant in a broader $1.1 billion Zika package, multiple sources said. Language in the emerging deal does not specify which providers are eligible or ineligible for funding, skirting a political landminethat delayed Zika aid for months. Despite the breakthrough on emergency funding for the battle against the mosquito-borne disease, several wrinkles remain in the continuing negotiations. In a brief interview Monday morning, Reid said nowhen asked whether there would be a deal on government funding later in the day. ?Close is relative,? Reid responded when asked whether an agreement was within reach. For instance, funding for the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, continues to be in the mix. Democrats on both ends of the Capitol have lobbied for Flint funds to be included in the government spending package, in particular the aid package included in a Senate water resources bill. But Republicans have similar demands: additional funding for flood-stricken Louisiana in the short-term spending measure. Both issues remained unresolved as of Monday evening, although senior Senate Democrats suggested theywouldn accept flood aid without also getting money for Flint. Congressional leaders are also still hashing out how to pay for the Zika funding package. ?Louisiana is not resolved because [Republicans] want to do Louisiana, we want to do Flint,? Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters Monday evening. ?Theydon want to do Flint.? Another issue that remains up in the air is a potential delay in the Obamaadministration proposal to hand over the U.S.government authority over the Internet domain system to an international body on Oct. 1 ? a pushthat being led by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and a host of other Republican lawmakers. If no deference is paid to Cruz and those lawmakers, the spending bill could turn into an internecine fight among Republicans ? even with some pushback on the provision from Democrats. ?This is the coordination of the domain names.It not who has control of the Internet,? Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the committee with jurisdiction over the issue, said Monday. ?And every institution, nationally and internationally, have all said that this is the appropriate thing to do.? Meanwhile, Democrats want to include language restoring the ability of the Export-Import Bank to finance projects greater than $10 million ? which ithasn been able to do because three of the five seats on thebank board are vacant. The Ex-Im issue is similarly toxic among Republicans, making it a difficult matter to take up ahead of an election. There are other items that could fill up theSenate legislative calendar this week before lawmakers return home until the November elections. Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) plan to force a Senate vote to block a $1.15 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia that the Obama administration announced last month. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said the exact timing of that vote was unclear, particularly because he would like to have the government funding measure resolved before moving on to other issues. Cornyn would also like to pair the arms sale vote with a roll call to formally override an expected veto by President Barack Obama of legislation that would allow family members of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorism attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia. Though Obama has not yet vetoed the measure, he has until Friday to do so. Republicans ? who are eager to return home to campaign for reelection, particularly with control of the Senate in the balance ? privately believe Democrats will try to drag out the negotiations as long as possible before the Sept. 30 deadline to pass government funding.

Manmade global warming proponents are always comparing those who disagree with them to ?flat-earthers.?

That myth was promulgated largely by Darwinists in the latter part of the 19th century as a way to discredit Creationists.

"Some experts believe waiting until after the election to strike back publicly means missing a chance to stem the tide of digital assaults. | Getty Lawmakers losing patience withObama silence on Russian hacking The window is rapidly closing for the White House to publicly hit back at Russia over a suspected Kremlin-backed cyber campaign to meddle in the U.S. election process, according to a vocal cadre of lawmakers who are hammering the Obama administration over its silence on the matter. The lack of any open retaliation, they say, is giving Russian hackers free rein to manipulate the election process in the final lap of the campaign season, sowing further doubts about an electoral system that GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump frequently bashes as ?rigged.? Story Continued Below ?I?ve been very surprised the administrationhasn done something about it,? said Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. ?I thinkit a very serious problem. Thisisn a small matter.It an historic matter. No one has ever been allowed to monkey around with our electoral system.? Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a frequent critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, lamented that the White House is tiptoeing around the hacks ?because of this obsession they have with not offending Putin because of Syria and other things.? ?If [Russia] did do it,? Graham added, ?the Obama administrationwon do a damn thing about it.? Numerous former Obama administration officials acknowledge that the longer the White House waits to unveil any response, the more political scrutiny the move will receive, given Democrats? allegations that the Kremlin is using its vast hacking apparatus to tilt the election in favor of Trump over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. ?It?s harder to do the closer we get to the election,? said Timothy Edgar, who served in the first Obama administration as the director of privacy and civil liberties for the White House national security staff. And some lawmakers and policy experts believe waiting until after Election Day to strike back publicly means missing a chance to stem the tide of digital assaults on election targets. ?Youcan deter after the fact,? said Adam Segal, an international cyber policy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. But officials are constrained by competing priorities that could take precedence over shaming Moscow for the hacks, which have compromised top Democratic political institutions as well as senior government officials on both sides of the aisle. Any response could put the final nail in the StateDepartment already faltering efforts to negotiate a Syrian ceasefire agreement with Russia, spark a tit-for-tat cyber war between Washington and Moscow and potentially expose valuable espionage tactics at a time that the U.S. government is reportedly ramping up its digital snooping onPutin regime. And many on both sides of the aisle, as well as former officials, cautioned that moving swiftly on public finger wagging, economic sanctions or criminal indictments ? the three most likely types of official responses ? may have little actual deterrent effect before the election. ?You know that countries conduct espionage on each other,? Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told POLITICO when asked if the White House needed to issue an overt response. ?You understand that, right?? House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) believes such public responses can establish an impossible mandate to identify hackers after every major breach. ?I thinkthat the danger in all this,? he said. ?If you start to name someone, well,you going to have no shortage of people to name, and in a lot of casesit not attributable.? The first of thissummer election-themed cyber intrusions ? at the Democratic National Committee ? probably led toJuly mass leak of 20,000 internal emails that appeared to show theparty favoritism for Clinton over her presidential rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). The message dump forced the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Later, hackers released the personal contact information of nearly every Democratic House member and staffer after another digital break-in at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Elsewhere, suspected Russian hackers have also targeted Clinton campaign staffers? personal emails , left-leaning advocacy groups , Democratic state officials and potentially even voter registration databases . According to media reports and numerous former officials, the Obama administration is probably far along in its investigation into the attacks. U.S. intelligence officials already have ? high confidence ? that Moscow is involved in the spate of hacks, according to anonymous federal officials quoted in The New York Times. On Thursday, Feinstein and House Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said they had heard enough in their briefings with officials to conclude that Russia is to blame. ?We believe that orders for the Russian intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from very senior levels of the Russian government,? the pair said in a joint statement. The remarks broke with other lawmakers ? even those like Graham ? who have cautioned against accusing Russia before authorities make an official determination. ?I very much hope the president will respond,? Feinstein told POLITICO. ?In my mind,there no question that the Russians have been poking around in our various systems.? Lawmakers across the political spectrum have echoedFeinstein call for a response ? regardless of who is responsible. ?We need to take action,? Senate Foreign Relations Committee ranking member Ben Cardin (D-Md.) told POLITICO. ?It?s not just naming,it ? using the tools we have available to make it clear wewon accept that type of behavior.? But with little more than six weeks to go before Election Day, the administration's choices may be limited. Preparing criminal indictments for the hackers responsible can take months, even years. The DNC hack was revealed only in June, kicking off the slate of intrusions and leaks that are still ongoing. In the last few weeks alone, suspected Russian-linked hackers have posted personal information on Democratic donors, revealed internal House race strategy memos from the DCCC and leaked the personal emails of former Secretary of State Colin Powell and an apparent White House staffer . ?If the process is governed by the criminal investigation, Idon see thatyou going to have any response by the election,? said Michael Zweiback, a former chief of the cyber crimes section of the U.S.attorney office inCalifornia Central District. Conversely, the administration has previously shown it can swiftly prepare economic sanctions following major hacks. It only took five weeks for the White House to announce sanctions on North Korea in retaliation for the bruising hack that temporarily disabled Sony Pictures Entertainment in late 2014. Whether similar sanctions could have a tangible deterrence effect on Russian hacking is debatable, though, even if such a move would help establish international norms in the long run. Christopher Swift, a former official with the Treasury Department office that oversees hacking-related sanctions, cautioned thatRussia economy has already had two years to adjust to the strict international penalties slapped on the country in response to its military action in Ukraine. Additional sanctions may not be adequateto alterMoscow immediate decision-making, he said. Russian state-backed hackers oftendon work for the Kremlin in an official capacity, making them even more insulated from sanctions, added Swift, now a national security professor at Georgetown University. Many on Capitol Hill have simply pressured the Obama administration to publicly blame Russia for the hacks if the investigation finds it culpable. ?The deterrence aspect of cyber response is very, very important,? said Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), who chairs a Senate Armed Services subcommittee that oversees cyber threats, during a recent hearing. ?Public responses make an impression, as well.? But cyber policy experts and former Justice Department and White House officials concede that any response before the election will have unpredictable ramifications on the presidential campaign trail, just as campaigns are entering the last leg of the race. ?No matter what they do, people are going to try and politicize it,? said Chris Finan, former White House director of cybersecurity legislation and policy. ?Idon know that they can completely insulate themselves.? ?Both candidates are going to be asked what their position is and what should be done about it,? said Ed McAndrew, a former DOJ national security cyber specialist. ?I think that the response, unless it is a strong response, is going to create more potential issues thanit going to solve, and that [is] certainly so for the candidates.? The White House is also boxed in by the shaky deal the State Department tried to reach with Russia to reduce violence in Syria. State is also working with Russia to enforce the wide-ranging, controversial agreement reached with Iran last year to reduce its nuclear capabilities. The State Department is one of several agencies ? including the Justice Department, Defense Department and the National Security Agency ? with a key voice at the table advising the White House on its response to the election hacks. Given the sensitive situation, some forces within State are probably more hesitant to prod Moscow over other issues at the moment, agreed former officials from multiple agencies who have been involved in similar deliberations. The State Department has as much ability to ?throw up the red flag? as any other agency, said Edgar, the former White House cybersecurity official, who is now a visiting fellow with the Watson Institute of International and Public Affairs at Brown University.

"Washington  The biggest story of the 2016 election is undoubtedly the rise of Donald Trump, and behind the Republican nominee is a group in its last throes as the biggest force in politics: The white working class. Contrary to many assumptions about this group, the poll finds working class whites generally happy with their lives, and mostly satisfied with their personal financial situation. Just 18% say they are angry about the way things are going in their own lives, and 44% think America's best days lie ahead. They are just as likely as their black and Hispanic working class counterparts to feel optimistic about their lives, 7 in 10 or more say so in each group. But the white working class harbors deep concerns about the country's economy, the amount the government is doing to help the working class and their own ability to influence politics. A majority, 53%, say they are very dissatisfied with the country's economic situation and 84% say their views are not well represented by the government in Washington, well above the share of white college graduates or black or Hispanic working class to say the same. About 6 in 10 white working class people say it's gotten harder for people like them to get ahead financially and two-thirds say it's harder to find good jobs. Many are concerned about what the next generation will face: 50% say they expect their children to have a lower standard of living than they currently have, compared with 35% among whites who have college degrees, 43% among the black working class and 31% among the Hispanic working class. More than other groups, whites without college degrees blame the government for the economic problems that beset the working class, with 62% saying the federal government deserves all or most of the blame for those problems compared with less than half among whites with degrees and the black and Hispanic working class, and 66% saying it doesn't do enough to help the working class. Amid these concerns, Trump holds broad appeal among white working class voters. Sixty percent say they would consider Trump this fall, about double the 29% who say they'd consider Hillary Clinton. Among other groups, far fewer even say they would consider Trump. Among whites with college degrees, 39% say they'd consider him -- that's cut in half among Hispanic working class voters, 18% of whom say they'd consider Trump, and just 3% of black working class voters say they'll give Trump a look. White working class voters are more Republican than Democratic, 56% in the CNN/KFF poll are Republicans or independents who lean that way, compared with 33% who consider themselves Democrats or are independents who lean that way, but the poll reveals that their views on what the government does to help people like them and the changing demographics of the country -- two issues that have been a central focus of Trump's campaign -- are driven by both education and partisanship. The undeniable trend For nearly all of American history, whites without college degrees -- the group identified as white working class for the purposes of this survey and in many assessments of the American electorate -- made up a majority of the public and a majority of voters. That has changed, and rapidly, at the same time the nation's economy has shifted to favor those who hold college degrees. Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980 by an electorate in which 63% of voters were whites who had not completed a four-year college education, according to exit polls. That had dropped 10 points by 1992, when Bill Clinton won the presidency. That election marked the last time exit polls would find whites without college degrees to be a majority of voters. By the time Barack Obama won the presidency in 2008, just 39% of those who cast ballots were whites without degrees. Census figures for voting and registration suggest that the white working class make up a larger share of the electorate than do the exit polls, roughly 44% in 2012 in that estimate. Both data sources have different and unquantifiable sources of error, and there has been some dispute over their true share of the electorate. Regardless of the data source, however, the trend is the same and undeniable -- the white working class is shrinking, and at the same time, their ability to influence American politics has declined. Enter Trump. Working class white voters have been critical to Trump's success. Throughout the Republican primaries, Trump's victories were bolstered by support from whites without degrees. Across 28 states with exit or entrance polls this spring, Trump averaged 50% support among white non-college GOP primary voters or caucus participants, compared with 37% among whites with college degrees. And across five CNN/ORC polls conducted since the primaries ended in June, Trump's lead among white non-college voters averages 29 points, while white college voters have broken in Clinton's direction by an average of 8 points. Restated in terms similar to the oft-cited gender gap, that adds up to a 37-point education gap among whites. According to exit polls back to 1980, it has never been larger than 14 points. The white working class shifts Republican Democrats used to be the party of the white working class, and Republicans, the party of the college educated. Those roles have flipped. Ron Brownstein, a CNN senior political analyst and editorial director for strategic partnerships at Atlantic Media who has reported extensively on this group, calls it class inversion. ""In the 50s, 60s, and 70s, Democrats ran better among non-college than college whites,"" he said. ""Starting in the 80s, the two lines converged, and in 2000, (Al) Gore ran better among college than non-college whites, (John) Kerry ran 6 points better, Obama 7 points."" Some of that is due to the shifting economy. Working class whites were largely synonymous with union members, who are traditionally staunchly Democratic. As the service economy has grown and manufacturing declined, the profile of union members has changed. In 1980, 70% of all voters who came from union households were whites without college degrees; in 2012, the white working class made up just were 39% of voters from union households. Non-whites and white college graduates were each about 30% of the union vote in 2012, almost double their share of the 1980 vote, and those two groups are increasingly Democratic. But some of it is their differing views on government and change in American society. Within the white working class, those who consider themselves Democrats and those who say they are Republican tend to agree in their assessment of how the working class is doing. About 7 in 10 working class white voters in each party say it's gotten harder for people like them to find good jobs, and narrow majorities of both say the government isn't doing enough to help ""people like you."" And while they don't see exactly eye-to-eye on immigration or the increasing diversity of the United States, both sets of partisans are more apt than their college-educated counterparts to see a negative side to the country's shifting demographics. Both working class white Democrats and Republicans are more likely than white college educated partisans to feel that the country's increasing racial and ethnic diversity is harmful because it leaves some people feeling left behind. The same pattern emerges in perceptions of immigrants, with white non-college partisans more apt than white partisans with degrees to say immigrants today are a burden on the United States and that the government should attempt to deport all immigrants currently living in the US illegally. And in a party whose second-place finisher for this year's presidential nomination considers himself a socialist, working-class white Democrats are less apt than their college-educated counterparts to consider themselves liberal or to be non-religious, two factors that could be driving them away from the Obama-era Democratic Party. Among white working class Democrats who are registered to vote, 22% say they would consider voting for Trump, vs. just 2% among white Democrats with college degrees, and nearly a quarter, 23%, say they will definitely not vote for Clinton, a figure that stands at 3% among white Democrats with college degrees. The effects of this shift are showing in recent swing-state polling. Trump's best chance to win the presidency comes by flipping rust-belt states where Democrats have had natural advantages in recent presidential elections and which have larger than average blocs of white non-college voters -- Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin among them. In each, Trump has cut into Clinton's advantage with broad support from the white working class. In the pure battlegrounds, Ohio and Iowa also appear to be shifting Trump's way on the strength of his support among white non-college voters. ""Democrats have run slightly better among blue-collar whites in Midwestern swing states, and that has been a key to them holding those states,"" said Brownstein. Will they vote? Majorities of voters across partisan, education, and racial lines say they are dissatisfied with the influence that people like them have on the political process. But there are broader differences when asked about the likelihood of actually turning out to impact that process. In the CNN/KFF Poll, 71% of white non-college voters said they always vote in presidential elections, and 79% rated the chances that they would vote a 10 out of 10. But both figures were smaller than among whites who do have college degrees, about 9 in 10 in that group said they always vote and would be very likely to this time around. But a CNN/ORC poll in early September found almost no difference between whites with degrees and those without in terms of enthusiasm about voting this year. Forty-two percent of white college graduates were extremely or very enthusiastic, as were 43% of white non-college registered voters. Should turnout levels among whites without degrees, whites with degrees and non-whites continue along their current trajectory, the white working class would likely emerge from 2016 still the largest voting bloc in the country in terms of race and educational attainment, for what may be the last time. The CNN/KFF Poll was conducted by telephone August 9 through September 5 among a nationally representative sample of 1,614 adults, including 701 people who were identified as working class whites -- white non-Hispanic adults who do not currently hold a four-year degree and, if under age 25, not currently enrolled in school.",0.030894309,0.002439024,0.001626016,0.016260163,0.051219512,0.31056910600000004,0.002439024,2,-1,1

To him,it annoying ? but not in the way one might think.

"Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. Assembly. During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his ""JV team."" Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle. The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution. ""If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,"" said Obama. President Obama continued by saying that we must ""be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy."" He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as ""a place like Syria, wherethere no ultimate military victory to be won."" Instead Obama suggested that we ""pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect."" Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with. It's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist. It's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse. It's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If we don't take action soon, then Obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, and others have suggested that Rahami be detained by the military as an enemy combatant, in part so he would not have be read his Miranda rights. Here are five common questions about terrorism suspects and the legal system: 1) Do U.S.-citizen terrorism suspects arrested within the United States have constitutional protections in the first place? Yes. There are ongoing debates over the constitutional rights of non-citizens (and citizens traveling overseas), but the Supreme Court has never suggested that a US citizen arrested within the United States receives lesser constitutional protection simply because he's a terrorism suspect.

In the case of the disability community, which cuts across all partisan and demographic divides, Clinton may be trying to attract not only ?Democratic-leaning voters who are not excited by her candidacy, but also voters who may be leaning toward Trump -- notably disabled veterans.? http://wapo.st/2cEXM4o -- ?Trump?s bizarre ad strategy:It less than 50 days until the election and the GOPnominee television advertisements have all but vanished,? by Steven Shepard: ?Trump?s ads last ran nearly a week ago in four battleground states: Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Since then, the GOP presidential nominee has ceded the airwaves to Hillary Clinton -- and is only poised to launch a limited, less-targeted ad campaign in the days before nextweek debate. ?While his campaign announced a new ad on Tuesday,it only going to run on national cable news stations and during two Sunday morning public-affairs shows, according to data from The Tracking Firm, a company that monitors media buys. And even with that seemingly modest buy ? the full extent of whichwasn clear on Wednesday night ? Clinton is still outspending him this week many times over. ?It?s unprecedented for a major-party nominee in this century to have such an on-again, off-again TV buy,? said Elizabeth Wilner, a former TV-network political director who, until last month, monitored political advertising for Kantar Media/CMAG.? http://politi.co/2cvLeP4 -- ?Trump: I reversed birther stance ?to get on with? campaign,? byAP Jill Colvin in New York: ?In a brief interview with an Ohio television station Wednesday, [Donald] Trump was asked why, after years as the chief proponent of the falsehood that the president was born outside the country, he decided to announce Friday that was no longer the case.

In an op-ed published to its website Tuesday, the editorial board backed Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump for president. ""The 2016 Republican candidate is not conservative and he is not qualified,"" the editorial board wrote. In the op-ed, the newspaper's editorial board breaks down why they believe that Clinton is more qualified than Trump -- specifically that the Democratic nominee has better temperament and experience, has a record of public service, and has withstood ""decades of scrutiny."" The Arizona Republic joins other major papers with conservative editorial boards in endorsing Clinton or declining to endorse Trump. The Cincinnati Enquirer and Dallas Morning News are two other notable examples, with the Enquirer endorsing a Democrat for the first time in 100 years. The New Hampshire Union Leader, for the first time in 100 years, did not back Republican nominee Trump, opting instead to endorse Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson.

"The Department of Homeland Security's inspector general said that 858 people who were ordered to be deported or removed instead eventually received citizenship. | AP Photo U.S. mistakenly granted citizenship to hundreds of immigrants At least 858 people who had previously been ordered to be deported or removed from the U.S. were instead granted citizenship, the Department of HomelandSecurity inspector general announced Monday. The mistaken citizenships were granted, the Department of Homeland Security explained in a press release, because neither its digital fingerprint repository nor theFBI fingerprint repository contain exhaustive records of individuals who have previously been deported. Story Continued Below The discovery was made by the Department of HomelandSecurity office of inspector general, which released a report Monday on the incomplete fingerprint records and the mistakenly granted citizenships. The Department of HomelandSecurity records are incomplete, the release said, because paper fingerprint cards used before 2008 were not consistently digitized. TheFBI records are incomplete because fingerprints collected during immigration enforcement activities were not always shared with the bureau. The inspector general's report specified that those granted citizenship were only ""potentially"" ineligible and were not necessarily granted citizenship incorrectly. A statement from the Department of Homeland Security said that the department is taking steps to correct the issues that led to the incomplete fingerprint records and that not all applicants whose records were incomplete wound up being granted citizenship. ""It is important to note that the fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization fraudulently. Preliminary results from the file reviews show that in a significant number of these cases naturalization had been denied and that, in some, naturalization was not improperly granted,"" department spokesman Neema Hakim said in the statement. ""Other cases are subject to ongoing criminal investigation or to denaturalization proceedings that are pending or completed."" In at least three cases, the inspectorgeneral office discovered previously-deported individuals who were granted citizenship and then obtained clearance for ?security-sensitive work at commercial airports or maritime facilities and vessels.? The release said all three have since had their security credentials revoked. ?This situation created opportunities for individuals to gain the rights and privileges of U.S. citizenship through fraud,? Inspector General John Roth said. ?To prevent fraud and ensure thorough review of naturalization applications, [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] needs access to these fingerprint records.? Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has made the vetting of immigrants as they enter the U.S. a major part of his presidential platform, suggesting during the GOP primary that America temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. until a more stringent vetting process could be put in place. He has since backed away from that proposal, which drew widespread criticism from both parties, in favor of a ban on immigration from ?any nation that has been compromised by terrorism.?",0.058651025999999995,0.002932551,0.002932551,0.008797654,0.046920820999999995,0.258064516,0.005865103000000001,2,-1,1

Trump went on to add that when he becomes President, Ford would have to pay a 35 percent tax on any car they send back to the United States for sale. Wow!That big news!It also, like 99.9 percent of what Donald Trump says, a gigantic lie, according to Ford CEO Mark Fields, who told CNN: ?It?s really unfortunate when politics get in the way of the facts.? CNN host Poppy Harlow then asked Fields, would Ford cut any American jobs as part of its plans to build a new manufacturing plant in Mexico? To that, Fields replied: ?Absolutely not. Zero. Not one job will be lost. Most of our investment is here in the US. Andthat the way it will continue to be.? Continue reading below the advertisement Ford has 85,000 workers in the United States, and that number has risen by 50 percent over the last five years. It currently employs 8,800 people in Mexico, and the new plant will create 2,800 additional jobs there. So once again we see that Donald Trump will say anything at all in order to muddy the waters and make it appear that he is the savior of the American economy.That a powerful message, especially in the industrialheartland like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, andWisconsin Trump is hoping to score big on Election Day. But Trump has financially screwed over thousands of small businesses and vendors over the years to have any legitimate clout on the economic issue.

The lead Clinton enjoyed for months in swing state and national polls has all but evaporated, raising the stakes for the first debate. The terrorism investigation in New York and New Jersey has also added to the urgency of her first meeting with Trump, which will touch on a litany of economic and security issues. Clinton, who has participated in more debates than any presidential candidate in recent history, faces a new challenge with Trump. She is preparing for Trump to confront her on a litany of uncomfortable subjects, ranging from her email scandal to Bill Clinton's infidelity to her health. Trump showed he was willing to go there Tuesday when he tweeted, ""Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary - see you at the debate!"" JUST WATCHED They can't say that on a debate stage...can they? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH They can't say that on a debate stage...can they? 01:23 Clinton, in a radio interview Tuesday, said she was ready to deal with Trump's attacks. ""I am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and the bigotry that we have seen coming from my opponent,"" Clinton said Tuesday on the Steve Harvey Radio show. ""I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff. I have been at this, I understand it is a contact sport."" To knock Trump off his game, people advising Clinton have been looking for a one-line retort that will be a memorable moment from the contest. Clinton has spent hours watching a highlight reel of Trump's Republican primary debates, according to several people familiar with her debate preparation. She took notes on what agitated him, particularly in his exchanges with rival Ted Cruz, and studied his style. But Democrats worry the first debate will give Trump a chance to show a more moderate, controlled side, while millions of people watch, possibly for the first time. This, according to people who have recently talked with the former secretary of state, is not lost on Clinton. Clinton told supporters at an August fundraiser that a friend told her: ""There will be about 100 million people watching and 60 million will be paying attention to the campaign for the first time. So don't assume they have followed anything."" ""There will be a lot of new impressions to be made that night,"" Clinton said. A team of veteran advisers are leading her debate effort, including Ron Klain, who advised Obama, and Karen Dunn, a long-time lawyer and aide. She is not setting up a formal ""debate camp,"" aides said, but intends to be secluded at her home in Chappaqua, New York, in the days leading up to the debate to prepare for her showdown on Monday. Clinton has also spent considerable time reading briefing books about Trump's policy, personality and politics, including receiving input from Tony Schwartz, who was the co-author for ""Art of the Deal,"" the best-seller about Trump. Expectations game Clinton aides worry that they can't lower expectations enough ahead of the event. ""For all his lack of substance, Trump's showmanship, as ex-reality TV star, makes him a formidable debate foe. He thrashed his rivals in GOP debates,"" Brian Fallon, Clinton's national press secretary, tweeted in August. With her Senate contests in 2000 and 2006, along with more than two dozen debates with Barack Obama in 2008 and nine meetings with Bernie Sanders in this primary campaign, she has stood on a debate stage more than 40 times. Trump will not be the first unconventional opponent Clinton has faced in a debate. Clinton all-but ended her 2000 Senate race against Rick Lazio during one of their debates when she stood strong as the Republican representative approached her lectern with a piece of paper and demanded she pledge to support stricter campaign finance rules. Lazio's bizarre move was seen as bullying and rude and Clinton handily beat him by 12 points in November. JUST WATCHED Debate expectations game is serious business Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Debate expectations game is serious business 02:46 Her debate last fall against four Democratic primary opponents was seen as an outright win for the secretary of state because of the way she handled prickly questions, including about whether she is progressive enough for the current bent of the Democratic Party. ""I'm a progressive. But I'm a progressive who likes to get things done,"" Clinton said, rolling out a line she would later use repeatedly while campaigning. Clinton's performances have not been without missteps, however. The former senator from New York cited the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks when asked about her ties to Wall Street, a response that aides later said came because their candidate was somewhat flustered by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders attacking her on the issue. Which Trump will show up? In the last few weeks, as Clinton has publicly turned to a more affirmative message, the former secretary of state has started to focus on how to present her own policies and defend herself against attacks. Clinton and her campaign aides have tried to keep a lid on leaks about Clinton's debate process, preferring not to telegraph to the Trump campaign how the former secretary of state will go after the businesses magnate. When asked about the debates, Clinton has tried to laud Trump's debating skill while admitting that it is for her to have a strong showing at Hofstra. ""I do not know which Donald Trump will show up,"" Clinton said at an August fundraiser in New York. ""Maybe he will try to be presidential and try to convey a gravity that he hasn't done before or will he come in and try to insult and try to score some points.""",0.030344827999999997,0.008275862,0.0027586209999999997,0.0027586209999999997,0.073103448,0.289655172,0.006896551999999999,2,-1,1
"If you tuned into the first presidential debate last night, you already know that Hillary Clinton pretty much wiped the floor with Donald Trump. Trump was so nervous and unprepared that he was reduced to constant sniffling, excessive thirstiness and his usual outlandish rants and interruptions.Let just say that everyone noticed. Trumpcouldn take the heat, and he definitely cannot handle the humiliation that is following the debate. While several major media outlets are calling the debate a clear win for Clinton, Trump is trying to come up with reasons why he bombed so horribly (even though it was perfectly obvious that he would). The best excuse Trump has been able to come up with is beyond pathetic and nothing but a move of desperation. The Associated Press has reported that after the debate, the GOP nominee immediately told reporters that he was unable to perform to the best of his ability because there was something wrong with his microphone. And yet despite something being ?wrong with it,? that mic seemed to work fine as he shouted over Hillary every few seconds. AP reported: ?Trump visited the media spin room after the Monday night debate and said, ?They gave me a defective mic!? He said he ?wonder(s), was that on purpose???CBS Sopan Deb also happened to be there and gave a little more detail intoTrump microphone conspiracy theory: Trump is seriously trying to claim that someone tried to sabotage the debate on purpose! What a moron. The truth is that Trumpdidn prepare for the debate like Clinton did ? and even if he had spent a little more time preparing than tweeting, itwouldn have mattered much ?he completely unqualified for the White House. Last night, Hillary showed America that these twoshouldn even be up against each other. There is no comparison. Hillary looked like our next President, and Trump looked like a fraud and an imposter who should have never made it up on that stage. Iwouldn be surprised if Trump comes up with more lame stories about why his performance was compromised last night.

"Washington  Hillary Clinton's top aide was given a limited immunity deal by the FBI in the investigation into Clinton's private email server, according to congressional sources Friday. Cheryl Mills, Clinton's chief of staff and adviser at the State Department, was given the narrow immunity deal during the FBI's investigation into the former secretary of state's use of a private email server during her time in office. ""This is beyond explanation,"" Rep. Jason Chaffetz said in a statement. ""The FBI was handing out immunity agreements like candy. I've lost confidence in this investigation and I question the genuine effort in which it was carried out. Immunity deals should not be a requirement for cooperating with the FBI."" A spokeswoman for Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, confirmed that Mills was being given immunity. But a Democratic congressional source said the extent of the deal was limited to a search of her and another aide's laptop. According to the source, the FBI requested the laptops of Clinton's attorneys, Mills and Heather Samuelson, after they conducted a 2014 review of what emails Clinton sent were work-related and which were personal. Work-related emails were turned over to the State Department and personal emails were deleted. In exchange for giving the laptops they used to the FBI, Mills and Samuelson were given a limited immunity agreement from the Department of Justice, the Democratic source said, that they would not face prosecution for any information that was found on those laptops. ""The DOJ and FBI considered my clients to be witnesses and nothing more,"" said Beth Wilkinson, an attorney for Mills. ""Indeed, the Justice Department assured us that they believed my clients did nothing wrong. At all points, my clients cooperated with the government's investigation, including voluntarily participating in interviews with the FBI and DOJ. ""The letters released to the Hill today only covered the computers that my clients had used in performing their legal work. Because of the confusion surrounding the various agencies' positions on the after-the-fact classification decisions, I advised my clients to accept this letter from DOJ."" A Clinton campaign spokesman said Friday's leak -- coming three days before the first presidential debate -- was politically motivated. ""Three days before debate, House GOP selectively leaks details from inquiry that was closed months ago w/no charges,"" Brian Fallon tweeted. Three days before debate, House GOP selectively leaks details from inquiry that was closed months ago w/no charges https://t.co/bzmVNKDf6a ? Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) September 23, 2016 A 'criminal scheme' The FBI announced in July that it would not recommend any criminal charges in relation to its lengthy investigation of Clinton's email use. FBI Director James Comey made the announcement in an unprecedented statement to reporters, during which he also excoriated Clinton's staff for its carelessness, all while saying no criminal acts were prosecutable. Since then, congressional Republicans have called Comey to testify and have demanded the FBI send its investigation materials for review. Comey is appearing again on Capitol Hill, testifying before the House Judiciary committee next Wednesday. He is expected to face more questions from Republicans about his handling of the Clinton email probe. Republican candidate Donald Trump seized on the news, with his spokesman saying it proves a ""criminal scheme."" ""No one with judgment this bad should be allowed to serve as President of the United States or hold any public office,"" said spokesman Jason Miller. ""In light of this development, Hillary Clinton must immediately come forward and promise the American people that none of these individuals will ever serve in any capacity in her administration."" The Democratic source, however, said that the immunity agreement was limited and that Mills testified before Congress and spoke with the FBI without invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. ""Mills was not given immunity for any testimony or statements she gave to DOJ. She gave voluntary statements to DOJ as she had previously to the Benghazi Committee,"" the source said. The top Democrat on the Oversight panel, Rep. Elijah Cummings criticized Republicans' response to the issue. ""It's beyonddisappointing not surprising in light of theelection Republicans are rushing to leak inaccurate information about this very limited agreement between Ms. Mills and the Justice Department,"" Cummings said in an statement, and pointed to praise Mills received from Republicans for her participating in a nine-hour interview on the issue. An IT staffer has also been given immunity in exchange for his testimony. Mills is a former legal adviser to Clinton's campaign, was her chief of staff at the State Department and has served on the board of the Clinton Foundation.",0.034671533,0.0,0.001824818,0.005474453000000001,0.05839416099999999,0.180656934,0.0,2,-1,1
"The Black Lives Matter movement is quick to cry foul whenever black people appear to be stereotyped. But what about situations when all the facts point to gang-related activity that is clearly racial and occurs against whites? That was the case in Atlanta, Georgia several weeks ago when a black gang entered the home of an 83-year-old white woman. That woman, Dorothy Dow, was sleeping in bed when a gang of four black men and women entered her home, beat her and then set her on fire. Dow passed away in the hospital recently from complications from the attack. Her attackers are now being charged with murder. Justin Grady, age 38, Cortavious Deshaun Heard, age 18, Mina Christine Ellery, age 17 and Angel Latrice Harmon age 17 are all being held without bond on charges of ""felony murder and malice murder."" The group entered Dow's home and pulled her from her bed where she was sleeping. One of the gang hit her repeatedly with a pistol, breaking the bones in her hand and her arm. Then Dow was covered in a flammable material and set on fire. She survived burning to death only because she pulled herself to a place where she knew she had kept a gallon jug of water. There she was able to pour the water on herself and put out the fire. Then, with a broken arm, she crawled to her cellphone and dialed 911. The local news station gives no reasoning about why the attack occurred, but as we well know, had the races been reversed, the entire country would be burning from the Black Lives Matter protests. We need to stop with this duplicitous nature in America. Death is wrong. Violence is wrong. Race shouldn't matter. h/t: CBS Atlanta",0.01025641,0.01025641,0.0,0.01025641,0.015384615,0.292307692,0.01025641,1,-1,1
"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte | Ye Aung Thu/AFP via Getty Images President of the Philippines to EU:F you Rodrigo Duterte tells EU to mind its own business after criticism of bloody drug crackdown. Rodrigo Duterte, the controversial president of the Philippines, used industrial language to describe the European Union on Tuesday after calls for him to halt a wave of killings as part of a war on drugs. Members of the European Parliament last week said they were concerned about the ?extraordinarily high numbers killed during police operations in the context of an intensified anti-crime and anti-drug campaign.? In a statement, they said: ?MEPs urge the Philippines government to put an end to the current wave of extrajudicial executions and killings, launch an immediate investigation into them and adopt specific, comprehensive policies and programs in full compliance with national and international obligations and respect for human rights.?Duterte response was brief. ?I read the condemnation of the EU against me. I will tell them, ?f?k you.?You doing it in atonement for your sins,? he told local government officials in Davao City, media in the Philippines reported. The president said EU nations were hypocrites for attacking him because of their own bloody histories. ?And then EU now has the gall to condemn me. I repeat it, ?f?k you,?? he said. Duterte earlier this month called Barack Obama a ?son of ab? when it was suggested he would face questioning by the U.S. president about the war on drug crime, which has claimed more than 2,400 lives in just over two months.

" A group of over fifty former intelligence officials and national security experts have written a letter demanding that he disclose the details of his ?overseas business investments.? Signed by both Republicans and Democrats, the call for transparency comes as Trump defiantly doubles down on his refusal to release his tax returns and reveal any potential conflicts of interest he might have as President. ?Donald Trump still has not revealed to the American public his international business relationships, even as it becomes increasingly clear that his overseas ties could well constitute significant conflicts of interest when it comes to charting U.S. foreign policy. This is unprecedented for a candidate for thenation highest office. As such, we are calling on Mr. Trump to disclose, in full, the nature of his business relationships overseas ? to include specifically who his business partners are and what and where are his foreign investments. The Newsweek article reports that Mr. Trump courted Muammar Qaddafi, a dictator who murdered his own people and who once pursued nuclear weapons and conducted terrorism against Americans. Newsweek also asserts that Mr.Trump other business partners have included Kremlin-tied oligarchs and Russians with mafia links, an individual accused of money laundering for the Iranian military, a Turkish media tycoon accused of running a fuel-smuggling ring, Indian companies that may have violatedIndia laws in their pursuit of business with Mr. Trump, and a South Korean company mired in scandal. Importantly, according to this news item, Mr.Trump business partnerships owe millions of dollars to Chinese entities. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised VladimirPutin authoritarian leadership, while outlining policies that read like a Kremlin wish list. He has claimed that Putin would never invade Ukraine, suggested permanently ceding Crimea to Russia and placed conditions on upholding our obligation to protect our NATO allies. He has floated lifting sanctions against Russia, which would benefit both Putin and the Trump Organization. Our policies must be motivated exclusively by what is inAmerica best interest, not by the financial interests of our president. The onus is on Donald Trump to assure voters that this will be the case by disclosing the nature of his overseas relationships and committing to divest such assets.? The letter was penned by signatories as noted as former acting CIA director Michael J. Morell, former undersecretary of Defense Michael G. Vickers, and former national security adviser Samantha Vinograd.Trump refusal to release his tax returns would appear to indicate that there are some serious irregularities that could potentially doom his candidacy for President, which his son pretty much confirmed in a foolish statement. The content of those tax returns has been the subject of much speculation, but givenTrump long history of tax evasion and political bribery, itdoesn take much imagination to assumehe committing some kind of fraud.He also suspected of accepting bribes from Russian oligarchs and has done business with authoritarian rulers likeLibya now-deceased Muammar Qaddafi, the emirs of the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of SaudiArabia ruling House of Saud.

" Republican nominee DonaldTrump Ohio chairwoman recently took it upon herself to prove to the world just how delusional the right-wing in America really is when Kathy Miller told reporters that racism in Americadidn exist until President Obama. ?Idon think there was any racism until Obama got elected. We never had problems like this ? Now, with the people with the guns, and shooting up neighborhoods, and not being responsible citizens,that a big change, and I thinkthat the philosophy that Obama has perpetuated on America. Growing up as a kid, there was no racism, believe me. We were just all kids going to school.? This perfectly illustrates how the right-wing digs their mental bogs of ignorance ? blame Obama for literally everything; absolve self/race/identity group of all responsibility, then construct pleasant fantasy. Supporting hercandidate constant efforts to sabotage what little support he has within the African-American community, she then went on to say that black Americans are responsible for the decades of their socioeconomic disenfranchisement by saying that ?ifyou black and youhaven been successful in the last 50 years,it your own fault.You had every opportunity, it was given to you.You had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kidsdidn have. You had all the advantages anddidn take advantage of it.It not our fault, certainly.? To put a big white cherry on this perverse cake of racism, she then felt the need to add that ?the Black Lives Matter movement is a stupid waste of time? and that low voter turnout is probably related to how black Americans ?were raised.? In one fell swoop, this woman has erased four hundred years of slavery, segregation and the Jim Crow era, the widespread lynchings of black Americans by radical Christian terrorist organizations like the Ku Klux Klan, the ghettoization of the inner cities, mass incarceration and the War On Drugs, and the wholesale slaughter of black Americans by law enforcement from the record. Instead, she is blaming the only black president our nation has ever had, when in reality it was his election that brought all the racism to the surface. She is echoing sentiments shared by a large portion of the American population which has been either brainwashed by media narratives or too ignorant know any better, but it shows just how large a divide we face in try to engage with people so entirely divorced from reality. When the daft old woman was informed that this might sound offensive to some people, she replied ?Idon care,it the truth.? The Trump campaign in a nutshell, ladies and gentlemen.

"New York  There's one thing Donald Trump brings to the debate stage Monday night: unpredictability. The Republican nominee and his allies hope his unconventional style will be a huge asset when he squares off against Hillary Clinton -- a skilled debater in her own right. But with 11 debates under his belt from the brutal Republican primary season, Trump has plenty of go-to moves when it comes to debating. Here's what we've learned from Trump's primary debate performances and what they could tell us to expect Monday night: Face-to-face insults Trump's affinity for insults and name-calling quickly became a staple of his presidential campaign. Jeb Bush may forever be remembered for the ""low energy"" moniker the billionaire coined. But Trump's name-calling on the stump before friendly crowds didn't stop when he joined his opponents on the same stage. Trump repeatedly called Texas Sen. Ted Cruz a liar to his face in several of the debates, and even pulled out the ""Lyin' Ted"" moniker. And when Marco Rubio repeatedly needled Trump, the brash billionaire didn't think twice before throwing ""Little Marco"" and ""lightweight"" in the Florida senator's face. ""This guy's a choke artist and this guy's a liar,"" Trump once said of Cruz and Rubio during a debate. The name-calling and insults served the dual purpose of drawing attention to the core vulnerabilities of Trump's opponents, while also deflecting from whatever attack they were throwing his way. If Trump sticks to this pattern, Clinton should gird herself for the ""Crooked Hillary"" moniker and a volley of adjectives from ""corrupt"" to ""criminal."" There's nowhere he won't go Trump has done more than just name-calling in the debates. A big reason his attacks have been so effective has been his willingness to strike where traditional politicians would hold back or take a less direct tack. After all, Trump is the candidate who suggested Ben Carson was incurably mentally ill due to childhood anger issues and floated the conspiracy theory that Cruz's father was involved in JFK's assassination. JUST WATCHED They can't say that on a debate stage...can they? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH They can't say that on a debate stage...can they? 01:23 Perhaps most memorably, during the March 3 debate, Trump defended himself from Rubio's attacks on the size of his hands -- and the implications about his manhood. ""He referred to my hands, if they are small something else must be small. I guarantee you there is no problem, I guarantee,"" Trump said. And physical appearance wasn't beyond the pale for Trump, who once threw this zinger at Rand Paul: ""I never attacked him or his looks and believe me there's plenty of subject matter right there."" Trump has already thrown every scandal and conspiracy theory Clinton's way. He's raised her husband's sex scandals and called her a ""nasty, mean enabler."" He's also revived the debunked theory that she was involved in the death of White House staffer Vince Foster and has suggested she's mentally and physically unfit to serve as president. Trump has already hinted that there's a chance he'll cross that line, but only if Clinton does first. Belittles canned responses The canned zinger is a staple of presidential debates that, if done right, can leave a mark. But Trump loves to slap down anything he considers to be a pre-packaged, poll-tested line. During the late February GOP debate, Rubio hit Trump with an seemingly prepared line: ""If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers he'll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it."" ""So cute. Such a cute soundbite,"" Trump fired back, undercutting the zing of Rubio' line. Clinton can expect a similar retort if she deploys the same tactic. It's part of a larger theme of Trump's candidacy -- one that bemoans and belittles ""all talk, no action"" career politicians and makes a mockery of tired political tropes. That's not to say he won't bring any prepared materials Trump hasn't brought any focus grouped zingers to his debate performances, but he has frequently recycled lines he's prone to use during rallies and in interviews. Whether it's about the ""third world"" nature of US infrastructure or lamenting the US trade imbalance with Mexico while saying their leaders are ""much smarter"" than those in America, Trump's debate performances are laced with Trump's favorite throwaway lines. But while his campaign has consistently sought to lower expectations and downplay the amount of effort the billionaire puts into debate prep, Trump has also arrived prepared. After Cruz attacked Trump on his ""New York values,"" Trump arrived at the following debate with a well thought out and even uncharacteristically poignant rebuttal. ""When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York,"" Trump said. Rapid fire Trump has prided himself on being a counter-puncher. He waits for his rivals to go after him and then he hits them back twice as hard. Throw that into a debate context and Trump's counter punching gives him a chance to show voters he's quick on his feet to dismiss rivals' attacks or deflect with one of his own. JUST WATCHED Do you remember these debate zingers? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Do you remember these debate zingers? 01:47 But Trump's knack for returning fire is also a tactic to try and knock his rivals off kilter and make them look weak. Rather than wait for his rivals to finish their attack, Trump might interject with a snide comment belittling the line or deploy one of his many facial expressions that will catch the attention of the television audience. The goal for Trump is to get under his rivals' skin, poking at them to draw them into a back-and-forth -- one Trump likely won't back down from. When it comes to Clinton, Trump's rapid-fire put downs are likely to sound a lot like the schoolyard put down, ""I know you are but what am I."" Pressed on his biggest weaknesses by Clinton, Trump has frequently replied in boomerang fashion, flinging Clinton's words right back at her. Go after the moderator If all else fails, Trump will turn to his favorite tactic of attacking the media -- in this case, the debate moderator Lester Holt of NBC. Faced with tough questions during the primary from conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt and Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly -- in two separate debates -- Trump deflected with a personal attack or threat. ""First of all, very few people listen to your radio show, that's the good news,"" Trump responded when Hewitt asked Trump about releasing his tax returns. And when Kelly asked Trump during the first primary debate last August about the disparaging comments he's made about women, Trump famously retorted with a warning. ""I've been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me. But I wouldn't do that,"" Trump said. Already, Trump has sought to work the refs, suggesting Holt would be unfair to him and arguing that moderators shouldn't play the role of fact-checkers.",0.022962113,0.0022962110000000003,0.004592423,0.014925373,0.04362801400000001,0.295063146,0.001148106,2,-1,1
"Donald Trump's reputation for being always available to reporters is way out of date. Trump is saying ""yes"" to Fox News almost every day but saying ""no"" to most other major networks and news organizations -- a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee. He called into ""Fox & Friends"" on Monday morning, he is booked on ""The O'Reilly Factor"" Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday. Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate's exposure to hard-hitting questions -- while fueling frustration among journalists. Trump's surrogates continue to say that he is more accessible than Hillary Clinton, but that is no longer true. Newt Gingrich knocked Clinton at a Trump rally on Monday afternoon by saying ""she doesn't do press conferences."" But Clinton has taken questions from reporters at half a dozen press conferences in the past two weeks, including as recently as Monday morning. These sessions, while relatively short, have been plentiful, while Trump has not held a press conference since July. Trump beat reporters are starting to make noise about the drought ? especially since Trump made Clinton's eight-month period without press conferences into a major campaign talking point. ""It's been more than 50 days since Donald Trump held a press conference,"" David Martosko of The Daily Mail tweeted Monday. Trump's recent TV appearances, on ""The Dr. Oz Show"" and ""The Tonight Show,"" made news, but not in journalistic settings. The Washington Post's Robert Costa had a newsmaking interview with Trump last week. But that's the exception to the rule. The New York Times last had an interview with Trump about a month ago. Trump last appeared on CNN in late August. Because Anderson Cooper challenged Trump about the candidate's muddled stance on immigration, The Post's Callum Borchers concluded that ""it didn't go very well"" for Trump. ""It went so not well, in fact, that you have to wonder whether his campaign will decide it's best to dodge the likes of Anderson Cooper and Chuck Todd ? or, for that matter, Chris Wallace and Bret Baier ? and stick to softball sessions with Sean Hannity and the 'Fox & Friends' crew,"" Borchers wrote afterwards. Trump's last time on NBC was the ""Commander in Chief Forum"" on September 7. Moderator Matt Lauer was widely criticized for his light touch with Trump. Related: Behind the scenes, NBC execs concede Matt Lauer forum performance was ""disaster"" The candidate's last time on ABC was a short interview with David Muir on September 6. His last time on CBS was a ""60 Minutes"" sit-down with Lesley Stahl on July 17. Trump does have another CBS interview in the works, a campaign spokeswoman said. TV networks are agitating for more interviews with both Trump and Clinton. The difference between the two is that Trump previously had a reputation for calling in to morning shows and sitting down with interviewers all the time. This accessibility also once extended to his traveling press corps. ""Trump used to be very, very accessible to the press. At the beginning of his campaign, he was extremely accessible,"" CNN politics reporter Jeremy Diamond said on Sunday's ""Reliable Sources."" ""You could catch him for quick interviews on the way in and out of rallies. And that has really changed."" Diamond said ""he is less accessible I think, in many regards, than Hillary Clinton at this point."" Trump's campaign declined to comment Monday on its media strategy. Republican communications strategist Ron Bonjean said most candidates in Trump's position would be ""trying to reach a a broader general election audience."" ""However, most Americans already know Trump as a household name and he doesn't need to diversify his interviews for additional exposure,"" Bonjean said. ""Trump is protecting himself from less friendly journalists while getting out his message at the same time even if it is to a more conservative audience."" This conservative-focused media strategy is also gaining attention among Trump's critics. ""He pretty much exclusively appears on Fox News now,"" Judd Legum, editor of the liberal news site ThinkProgress, tweeted on Monday. Trump's relationship with Hannity is perhaps the best symbol of how the candidate gets out his message on his own terms. Trump has taped numerous town halls with the conservative commentator. According to TVNewser, Wednesday's town hall will focus on ""issues and concerns surrounding African-Americans this election cycle."" According to Nielsen data, only 1.5% of Hannity's 2 million nightly viewers are African American. Overall, at any given time of day, about 2% of Fox News viewers are African American.",0.029950083,0.001663894,0.003327787,0.011647255,0.058236273,0.272878536,0.0,2,-1,1
"There may be a few women out there who enjoy a man telling them to be more joyous in their presence, but as for the rest of us,there nothing a woman hates more than being told to smile. Do men smile all the time? No. Because if they did,we think they were crazy and up to something. Same goes for women. Not every situation calls for a smile at all times. Especially when discussing foreign policy and our military. So, when RNC Chair Reince Priebus thought it appropriate to criticize Hillary Clinton for not smiling enough during the NBC forum hosted by Matt Lauer, itdidn exactly go over well. One person who definitely had a lot to say about Priebus and his request of a smile from Hillary was none other than Chelsea Handler on her hit Netflix show Chelsea. Chelsea began by asking Priebus: ?Who the f*ck are you to tell someone to smile?? Adding: ?This is just another example of how men feel the can belittle every woman in the world and order up a smile.? Chelsea then said: ?Stop telling women to smile. Wedon like that.It not an icebreaker,it a deal breaker.? Going for Priebus? jugular, Chelsea absolutely destroys him and his ridiculously corny smile, then says: ?You know when women will smile? When Hillary kicks that pneumonia and trounces Trump in November.? Andthat exactly right.

"Obama calls Islamic State a 'failed cause' Even as law enforcement continues to investigate a series of bombings over the weekend in and around New York City, President Barack Obama said Monday that military successes against the Islamic State have exposed the militant group ?as the failed cause that it is.? The president declined to offer specifics of the investigation into the bombings, referring reporters to the FBI and other law enforcement agencies for updates. But as the president was speaking, NBC News and other media outlets began reporting that Ahmad Rahami, a man wanted in connection with the bombings, had been taken into custody. Story Continued Below Law enforcement has not publicly tied Rahami, a U.S. citizen of Afghan descent, to any terrorist group but in his public statement Monday, Obama spoke not just about the investigation into theweekend attacks but also the global fight to combat terrorist groups like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda. ?We will continue to lead the global coalition on the fight to destroy ISIL, which is instigating a lot of people over the Internet to carry out attacks. We are going to continue to go after them. We're going to take out their leaders, we're going to take out their infrastructure,? the president said from New York, where he will attend the United Nations General Assembly meeting later this week. ?As we take away more of their territory, it exposes ISIL as the failed cause that it is. And it helps to undermine their ideology which over time will make it harder to recruit and inspire people to violence.? Speaking specifically to the ongoing investigation into the bombings in New York and New Jersey, the president said he had been briefed by FBI Director James Comey and had spoken with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. The president also said that a ?particularly high level of federal resources? were already in place in New York to assist with the UN General Assembly and that those resources would be able to assist in the investigations. Recalling his conversations with governors Cuomo and Christie, Obama praised New Yorkers and New Jerseyans for their toughness: ?Folks around here, you know, theydon get scared. They are tough. They are resilient. They go about their business every single day.? ?That kind of toughness and resoluteness and a recognition that neither individuals nor organizations like ISIL can ultimately undermine our way of life. That's the kind of strength that makes me so proud to be an American,? the president said. ?By showing those who want to do us harm that they will never beat us, by showing the entire world that as Americans we do not and never will give in to fear, that's going to be the most important ingredient in us defeating those who would carry out terrorist acts against us.?",0.031545741,0.0031545740000000003,0.012618296999999999,0.012618296999999999,0.047318612,0.32807571,0.018927445,2,-1,1

"Terrorism is terrorism, regardless of the source, and two American cities felt the sting of it over the weekend. Is it really that hard to say? Apparently. And if someone on the left does summon up the word, it must always be supplemented with a descriptor. One of two terrorist attacks, a bombing, occurred this weekend in Manhattan, N.Y. ?No-one has come forward to admit to planting the device, which exploded in a dumpster,? Cuomo said, but citizens should make no mistake: ?a bomb exploding in New York is an act of terrorism.? Got that. At the time he stated (Sunday morning), that no one, or group, had claimed responsibility. Yet he was quick to insist it was not the work of ISIS, or any specific group. However, he also added that, ?We?re not going to let them win. They want to make you afraid.We not going to let them instill fear.? Okay ? so Cuomo admitted he/wedon know who the bomber is, yet he knows for a fact it is definitely not ISIS, but wecan let THEM win. If he/wedon know who the bomber is ? may I ask who THEM is? Knowing that even in the face of tragedy, democrats consider everything through a political lens ? is the definitely ?not ISIS? exclamation by Governor Cuomo a veiled attempt not to tieObama mass immigration of Muslims to the U.S.? Idon know, but Iwouldn doubt it. The Manhattan bomber may not be the work of an Islamist, but the attack at a Minnesota mall on Saturday sure was. As I stated, regardless of the source, the two acts were terrorism none the less.

Interested in Elections? Add Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest ?That makes me smart,? Trump said from the debate stage at Hofstra University tonight. He has said repeatedly he is being audited by the IRS and cannot release his tax statements until the review is concluded. But during the first general-election presidential debate, in Hempstead, New York, the real estate mogul vowed to release his tax returns ?against mylawyer wishes? if Clinton releases emails she deleted from a private server she used while she was secretary of state. ?As soon as she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted, as soon as she releases them,? Trump said tonight, amid cheers and applause, ?I will release my tax returns.? The White House hopefuls also clashed repeatedly over their tax plans during the debate, with Clinton accusing Trump of proposing the ?most extreme version? of ?trickle-down economics.? ?The biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in county thanwe ever had,? the Democratic presidential nominee said from the stage. ?I call it trumped-up trickle-down becausethat exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy.? Before Trump had a chance to defend his tax policy, Clinton took another jab. ?Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit,? she continued. ?He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that.? Trump, who released his tax plan earlier this month, has proposed tax cuts across the board, including income tax reductions for the top 1 percent and eliminating federal estate tax as well as gift taxes. Meanwhile, Clinton has called for tax hikes for the wealthiest Americans and closing corporate loopholes that allow the rich to evade some tariffs. Trump fired back, blaming ?politicians like Secretary Clinton? for plunging the nation into debt. ?We?re a debtor nation,? he said. ?We have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And wedon have the money becauseit been squandered on so many of your ideas.? Clinton suggested thatTrump alleged failure to pay federal income tax might also be part of the problem.

"Arizona's laws on child molestation are so broad that a parent changing a diaper could be prosecuted for criminal activity. That is the opinion of defense attorney Russ Richelsoph and a minority of judges on the Arizona Supreme Court, according to The Arizona Republic. Child molestation in Arizona is defined as intentionally or knowingly engaging in sexual contact with a child under the age of 15. Sexual contact is interpreted as ?direct or indirect touching, fondling or manipulating? of achild genitals or private parts. Unlike other states, the Arizona law does not require there to be an intent to harm, violate or arouse by the alleged perpetrator. In a recent ruling, the Arizona Supreme court confirmed that proving intent was not necessary. As a result, it ruled that a parent changing a diaper or a physician conducting an examination could be charged with molestation under the current interpretation of the law. ?When you have a statute that criminalizes such a broad set of behaviors thateverybody a criminal, everybody who has changed a diaper, every physician or nurse who has examined the genitals of a child,that a huge problem,? defense attorney Russ Richelsoph told The Republic. Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery disagreed and believes some common sense has to be observed. ?I?m a parent. I have prosecutors who are parents,? Montgomery said. ?We know the difference between diapering and molesting a child.? Montgomery said prosecutors handle such cases carefully. ?If a defendant is going to bring that up in trial and wedon have any evidence to show that there was sexual motivation, then juries are not going to convict, grand jurors are not going to indict,? he told KPNX. The court ruling said that changing the law was the responsibility of politicians. ?We agree that the criminal code should clearly differentiate between unlawful conduct and innocent, acceptable behavior without unnecessarily broadly sweeping the latter into the former,? the court opinion stated, The Republic reported. Two judges authored a dissenting opinion. ?Parents and other caregivers who have changed aninfant soiled diaper or bathed a toddler will be surprised to learn that they have committed a class 2 or 3 felony,? the dissenting judges argued. Richelsoph described scenarios in which the legislation could be abused. ?Physicians get accused of molesting children. Parents, especially in divorce situations, get accused of molesting children,? Richelsoph added. ?And then you have someone spending a lot of money on a private defense attorney or having to get a public defender.?",0.024305556000000002,0.013888889,0.013888889,0.010416667,0.065972222,0.28472222199999997,0.006944444,2,-1,1
"Howard Dean stands behind Trump 'coke user' tweet Despite a lack of evidence, former Vermont Gov.

As the nominees debated at Hofstra University in New York on Monday night, Dean ? a Democrat who is supporting Hillary Clinton in the race ? tweeted: ?Notice Trump sniffing all the time. Coke user?? Story Continued Below The comment reverberated around the Twittersphere ?it been retweeted some 26,000 times ? but also drew criticism for being a low blow and a conspiracy theory.MSNBC Kate Snow, speaking with Dean on Tuesday afternoon, asked, ?Why did you go there?? Dean, who is a physician, clarified that he was not actually assigning Trump a cocaine addiction diagnosis ? ?You can't make a diagnosis over the television; I would never do that,? he said ? but maintained thatTrump sniffling, as seen at the debate, ?is actually a signature of people who use cocaine.? Then he pivoted the discussion to argue that Trump should release his tax returns and more detailed medical records. ?He sniffs during the presentation, which is something that users do,? Dean said, and then attributed a series of other characteristics to Trump that he said ?accompanies that problem.? He has ?grandiosity,? delusionsand ?trouble with pressured speech? and ?couldn't keep himself together? on Monday, Dean said. ?I think it would be interesting to ask him and see if he ever had a problem with that.? ?I just was struck by the sniffing and then by his behavior, which all sort of came together, these four symptoms,? Dean continued. ?You know, do I think he has a cocaine habit? I think it's unlikely that you could mount a presidential campaign at 70 years old with a cocaine habit, butit striking.? Snow pushed back, comparingDean comments to theories propagated by Trump surrogate Rudy Giuliani earlier in the race, questioningClinton health. ?Youdon see the parallel?? she asked. ?Donald Trump has not only not made his tax returns public,he also not made his medical history public in any meaningful way,? Dean responded. ?Hillary Clinton has done that and has answered any question that Giuliani may want to raise.? And, Dean told Snow, he has no plans to apologize for the comment, or delete the tweet. ?Idon think this is a ridiculous idea. Something funny was going on with Trump last night. Do I think it was cocaine? Probably not,? he said. ?Thisguy already proving himself to be unstable. The question is, why is he unstable??

"Former CIA chief: Obama's 'retrenchment' like Trump's 'America First' President Barack Obama and Donald Trump are alike in at least one regard, according to former CIA Director Michael Hayden. ""You know, last week I mentioned there was difference in language between Mr. Trump and President Obama. You know, there's not a whole lot of difference between the Obama administration's retrenchment and Mr. Trump's America First. There are common themes there,"" Hayden said Wednesday on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" during a discussion of Obama's final United Nations address. Story Continued Below Hayden, who served as CIA director under George W. Bush from 2006-2009 and briefly under Obama, remarked on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" that the last Republican president ""probably would have been challenged to make a speech so eloquent as PresidentObama yesterday,"" while adding that Bush ""would have done so much behind the scenes."" ""I sat in the Oval Office. We had a meeting and he would just turn over his shoulder and say, ?Get me [former Pakistani President Pervez] Musharraf.? He actually worked on the issues and invested his personal energy and I should add personal prestige and political capital in risking that in order to make things different in the world,"" Hayden said. ""And sadly, I just don't think we're seeing much of that in the last half a dozen or eight years."" Former Bush aide Nicolle Wallace offered her own criticism of Obama's speech, noting that she heard from Middle Eastern leaders would likely describe the president's address as ""probably decent and perhaps elegant analysis, but he's not an analyst."" ""What they heard was the complete lack of any connection to any world leaders. He didn't give a speech in that room as though he were in constant contact with anybody else in the room,"" Wallace said. ""He gave a speech as if he never talked to these people, as though the only contact were public ones and that that was so different not just from George W. Bush, who had better private relationships than some of the conflicts that erupted in public, but ... there hasn't been an American president with fewer or weaker relationships with world leaders.""

"Karen Dunn is polite, precise and barely more than five feet tall -- but after BarackObama dreadful first debate against Mitt Romney in 2012, she got up in the face of the leader of the free world. ?You need to punch him in the mouth!? said Dunn. Story Continued Below And Obama did ? delivering a powerful, campaign-stabilizing performance at Hofstra University on Long Island, the location ofMonday critical showdown between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, a debate that is likely to be the most watched political event in history.It not clear if Dunn and her partner Ron Klain ? the two most experienced debate prep specialists in Democratic politics ? are giving Hillary Clinton the same advice. But they are overseeing an orderly and intensely secretive process designed to armor a battle-scarred debater for an unpredictable face-off that presents great dangers ? but also an opportunity for Clinton to reverse the fall narrative of a Trump surge.Clinton team of lawyers are facing the greatest challenge of their professional lives ? andthat saying a lot, considering that Klain, JoeBiden former chief of staff, was tapped by Obama to solve the Ebola crisis. They know that Trump ? a quick-study political novice participating in the first one-on-one debate of his life ? is a wild card who can turn weeks of pouring over briefing books into mockery with a single, brilliant and bullying punch. ?The fear is thatshe get lost in the moment, and no one is better at seizing the moment than Trump,? said a longtime adviser to both Clintons. Indeed,thatwhat worryingClinton inner circle ? that victory will come down to something like tone, which she has always struggled with, vacillating between cold and severe to thoughtful and wry. But the traditional, substantive sessions now underway are key to settling thecandidate head, longtime aides said. ""The prep matters because it gives her the confidence to know she is armed,? said one longtime Clinton ally. ?She will feel more comfortable if she's prepared the way she likes to prepare.? Clinton, for all her knowledge, polling and top-tier coaching, has always been defined not by whatshe said on the debate stage but by howshe dealt with what her opponents have said about her. These debate moments have represented many of the biggest pivot points inClinton career ? from her deft parrying of Rick Lazio in 2000 to her collapse underObama fire at the disastrous Nov. 2007 debate in Philadelphia that demolished her frontrunner status. With Clinton, a conventional politician trapped in the reality TV world of 2016,it all about the reaction shot ? and the Dunn-Klain team is laboring mightily to make sure she gets it right. No secret on the Clinton campaign has been more closely guarded than the identity of the person who is impersonating Trump in the closed-door sessions staged atClinton Manhattan office and at her home in Chappaqua.Clinton advisers, in conversations over the last month, have repeatedly emphasized that the mock debate session, while important, is less vital than the informal law school sessions where Clinton hashes out her reactions and attacks. ?It?s a moot court set-up,? said a Clinton insider. ?She?s doing less of the usual mock debate sessions, with 100 people standing around, this time.? Another added that her preparation this year ?is more style than substance.They trying to prepare her for the different Trumps that might show up.? On Saturday, the New York Times reported that longtime Clinton aide Phillippe Reines had been playing the role of Trump in mock sessions. Several Democrats who have spoken to the participants told POLITICO that another person playing the role of interlocutor has been campaign chairman John Podesta, a sharp-tongued veteran operator known less for bluster than behind-the-curtain scheme-spinning. The buttoned-down, courtly Klain has also stood in parrying questions with Clinton, according to people close to the situation ? but both men have been less concerned with imitating Trump than preparing Clinton for the substance of the attacks, two keen attorneys framingClinton reactions in the precise, disciplined language their lawyerly candidate thrives on. ?It?s an unconventional year, andhe an unconventional candidate, so maybe preparationdoesn matter,? said David Axelrod, a former top strategist to President Obama. ?But in my experience, the candidate who comes on the stage, and can anticipate the rhythm of the thing, and knows what they want to do, has a huge advantage.? Insiders said Clinton's debate group has tried to frame every minute on the stage as a referendum on the issue of trust -- to convince voters with doubts about Clinton to contrast those concerns with how they feel about Trump handling the nuclear codes. But there is still fear of the unknown that is the other half of the equation on stage with her. ?You?re just not sure who is going to show up, so you have to do it, you have to assume he may be aggressive, or he may lay back,? communications director Jennifer Palmieri said. ?That?s hard to game out.?Clinton experience and confidence can make her an intimidating person to prep -- when you count her own three dozen on-stage debates there is arguably no one in American politics with more prime-time experience. Her coaches, however, are also longtime debate aficionados -- campaign consultants Joel Benenson, Jim Margolis and Mandy Grunwald all sit in on prep, as does Palmieri, longtime attorney Bob Barnett, senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan, Podesta, occasionally Bill Clinton, younger policy aides who have helped compile the thick green binders of prep materials, and others. Klain and Dunn, who report directly to Sullivan, not only offer an overarching strategy, but act as speechwriters -- line-writers, really -- paring down language and crafting practiced lines. ?I have a tendency to want to give a deep dissertation on an issue or a problem,? said Sen. Cory Booker, who Dunn has prepped for Senate debates. ?Karen knew she had to break me of the habit, but do it in a way that still allowed me to feel like Iwasn dumbing things down. She really studied me. She already knew the language I was using out there.? Like Clinton, Booker said he was hesitant to disgorge pre-packaged lines. But the forceful Dunn pressed him, just as she goaded Obama. ?Shedidn call them ?lines,?? he said. ?She called them ?moments.?? Dunn has even force fed some catchphrases to the notoriously message-resistant Clinton. In the primary debate in New Hampshire last February, which coincided with opening weekend of the new Star Wars movie, Dunn pennedClinton sign-off: ?thank you, good night, and may the force be with you.? Clinton loves the self-education aspect of the process. But she has long despised the confrontational aspects of the mock debate dry runs, even whenshe not on the stand -- she never participated in herhusband debate preps, a noticeable absence when she served as a top campaign adviser in every other aspect of his presidential campaigns. During a tense prep session after Bernie Sanders? stunning and slim win in the Mar. 8 Michigan primary, for instance, Clinton was so fed up with the criticisms being lobbed at her she decided to just do the job herself. When D.C. attorney Bob Barnett, who was playing Sanders, began peppering her with attacks in a drab hotel conference room, a clearly agitated Clinton shut the session down and declared, ?How about I play Bernie?? Over the next hour or so, Clinton ? to the surprise of her staff ? staged a credible and unvarnished version of Sanders? attacks on her economic plans and close ties to Wall Street, according to two people with knowledge of the exchange. For a time, Sullivan took the role of the former secretary of state and framed several new responses that later became a staple ofClinton debate routine. ?It turned out to be one of the most productive sessions we had,? said a Clinton ally. Dunn and Klain have been through the fire before ? Klain was responsible for the strategy that helped John Kerry win his first debate against George W. Bush by attacking him for not catching Osama Bin Laden. And many ofObama top advisers, including his wife, Michelle, credit the Klain-Dunn team for his fall 2012 turnaround. Klain, known for his minutely drafted action memos, started ginning up an attack plan for the president before the first debate in Denver was even over. But it was the incongruous image of Dunn surrounded byObama male-dominated staff that woke up the president with her ?punch him in the mouth!? summons, a quote that, for many people, stuck. Unlike the rest ofClinton debate coaches, Dunn and Klain have day jobs. Dunn, who represents Uber, Apple and Oracle in her day job as a partner at Boies, Schiller & Flexner LPP, is a top litigator (and also HumaAbedin personal attorney). Klain works at Revolution, LLC, a private investment firm. But there hasn't been a Democratic presidential debate without one of them involved in decades. But coaches don't play. For Clinton, success against Trump on Monday night may have more to do with how she silently projects authority when under attack. ?If Trump can be positioned to bully her, that will probably be his biggest failing,? said another longtime Clinton insider. ?And her pushing him back politely, sothere a difference between his level and her level, that will be her biggest strength.? In the end, it might not be anything Clinton says that matters. Many longtime aides credited the power of her reaction shot ? a comically disapproving maternal glare honed from her years as a first lady enduring another long spiel by somebody else -- as one of her most valuable weapons in communicating gravitas and strength in the face ofTrump expected insults. If you want an insight into the attitudeClinton aides want her to portray, check out the latest episode of ?Between Two Ferns.?Clinton appearance on the web comedy sketch show, which posted Thursday, shows the Democrat at her silent best -- it was quickly hailed by critics as one of her most successful interviews, and the candidate who struggles with articulating a coherent positive message didn't even say much. She sat with a bemused expression on her face while comedian Zach Galifianakis lobbed the absurd at her, asking with a deadpan whether she would have to take a leave of absence from the White House if she got pregnant, and if she was ""down with TPP."" One of Clinton's finest moments in the primary debates was her non-reaction to Lincoln Chafee questioning her ?ethical standards? because of her email use. When asked by moderator Anderson Cooper if she wanted to respond, Clinton smiled and shook her head. ?No,? was her terse response, and the audience roared.",0.022275259,0.00477327,0.00477327,0.010342084,0.038186158,0.229116945,0.0,2,-1,1
"A senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus stepped up to a lectern on the House Floor on Thursday and listed all the innocent activities that can be a death sentence for African-Americans. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), armed with a variety of props, depicted all the things that can cause black people in the United States to be killed at the hands of law enforcement because they are viewed with suspicion, even when engaging in harmless activities. ?Each time we lose a precious life to fear, distress, and prejudice, the list of things that will get you killed as a black person in America gets a little longer,? Lee said. Among the items she held up were: A bag of skittles ? representing Trayvon Martin, who was walking home after purchasing a bag of the candy in Sanford, Florida when he was killed by a neighborhood watchman in 2012. A subway card ? representing Oscar Grant, who was riding the subway in Oakland, California when he was killed by a BART police officer in 2009. A pack of cigarettes ? representing Eric Garner, who was allegedly selling loose cigarettes in Staten Island, New York when he was killed by police in 2014. A CD case ? representing Alton Sterling who was selling CDs in Baton Rouge, Louisiana when he was killed by police in July. A wallet ? representing Philando Castile, who was reaching for his wallet during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minnesota when he was killed by police in July. A picture of a toy gun ? representing Tamir Rice, who was playing with a toy gun in Cleveland, Ohio when he was killed by police in 2014. A license plate ? representing Samuel DuBose, who was pulled over for a missing license plate in Cincinnati, Ohio when he was killed by police in 2015. A red toy car ? representing Sandra Bland and Walter Scott who were all killed by police after being pulled over for minor traffic violations; as well as Terence Crutcher who was killed after his SUV stalled out. ?Should any of this warrant a death sentence? Is this the America you want to live in?? Lee asked. Lee said that when her sons were young she had ?tough conversations? with them, warning them to be careful in their interactions with the very same police officers who are sworn to serve and protect them. ?Since Michael Brown was shot in Ferguson two years ago, 2,195 people have been killed by police in our nation. As the mother of two black men and the grandmother of five black grandchildren, I worry that someone I love could become number 2,196,? she said. The issue of fatal police shootings of African-Americans has come to the forefront again after three more killings rocked the nation.

"Story highlights Presidential candidates are sometimes respectful in referring to opponents by name But not always (CNN) Name-calling has been the norm this political season, but it's unclear what salutations Hillary Clinton and Donald will use when they meet face-to-face Monday night. Past debates have usually featured a degree of formality and respect above harsh campaign trail rhetoric. Will that hold in 2016? There's at least some reason to think GOP nominee Trump and Democratic rival Clinton will tone it down Monday, based on some of the nicer ways they've addressed each other. Yes, Clinton frequently uses Trump's last name derisively, as ""Trump."" But she's just as likely to refer to him to ""Donald Trump"" and sometimes even ""Mr. Trump."" He's famously tagged former Secretary of State Clinton ""crooked Hillary."" But he also regularly refers to her ""Hillary,"" ""Hillary Clinton"" and from to time ""Secretary Clinton.""

"AP Photo Big money fuels Clinton super PAC surge The top five donors to Priorities USA supplied half the August haul. Hillary Clinton got a major boost in August from some of her richest and most loyal supporters, with 11 seven-figure checks to fuel a spending surge from the main super PAC supporting her candidacy. Priorities USA Action raised $23.4 million in August, more than half of which came from its top five donors, according to its monthly report filed Tuesday with the Federal Election Commission. It was the super PAC's best fundraising month by far, more than doubling July's take. Story Continued Below Slim-Fast founder Daniel Abraham and Newsweb chairman Fred Eychaner each gave $3 million. Billionaire financier George Soros kicked in $2.5 million, and investor Donald Sussman and Laurene Powell Jobs' Emerson Collective both added $2 million. Sussman's latest gift brings his tally for the cycle to $13 million, the most of any of Clinton's benefactors. Working for Working Americans, the Service Employees International Union Committee On Political Education, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association PAC, investor Henry Laufer and his wife, Marsha, all gave $1 million. The super PAC took advantage of the influx to step up its spending, dropping $20.6 million and ending the month with $41.5 million on hand, according to the report. It paid BuzzFeed $1 million for digital ads, $405,400 to Global Strategy Group for research and consultant travel, $247,600 to Ralston Lapp Media for video production and media consulting, and $234,400 to Shorr Johnson Magnus for the same. The report showed a $28,000 payment to CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm that has also been serving the Democratic National Committee in the aftermath of its email hack. The PAC spent $15,600 at the Ritz Carlton Philadelphia, where top donors and fundraisers stayed during the Democratic National Convention.

Asked about her views on the practice, Lynch said she would not be drawn into debate about comments made by political candidates, but she clearly disagreed with the GOP presidential nominee by insisting that the use of the tactic had been counterproductive in New York City. ""In New York ? that practice was implemented in a way that was not helpful to community trust and to, frankly, public safety and enhancing the relationship between law enforcement and community members,"" Lynch said in response to question from POLITICO at a press conference about a crackdown on mail-fraud schemes. ""The issue with stop-and-frisk in the New York area was the widespread indiscriminate use of that practice, particularly when it was not generating success from a law enforcement perspective, in either leads or tips or firearms, and the resulting lack of trust that it generated,"" the attorney general said. In an interview Wednesday, Trump called for broader use of stop-and-frisk and specifically praised its success in combating crime in New York. ""I see what's going on here, I see what's going on in Chicago,"" Trump said in Cleveland during a taping of Fox News' ""Hannity "" ""I think stop-and-frisk, in New York City, it was so incredible the way it worked. And, we had a very good mayor. But New York City was incredible the way that worked. So, I think that would be one step you could do."" Use of the proactive technique, promoted by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, has long angered many civil rights activists. In 2013, a judge in New York ruled that it had been carried out in an unconstitutional, racially discriminatory manner. An appeals court halted that ruling, but while the appeal was pending, the city ? under new Mayor Bill de Blasio ?wound up settling the case. In comments Thursday, Trump revised his earlier remarks, insisting he was only advocating the practice in murder-plagued Chicago. ?I was really referring to Chicago with stop-and-frisk,? he told ?Fox and Friends? during a phone interview Thursday morning. ?They asked me about Chicago and I was talking about stop-and-frisk for Chicago.? Chicago has seen a spike in murders and shootings, with over 500 killings in 2016 and three months still to go in the year. ""I think Chicago needs stop-and-frisk,? Trump said. ?Now, people can criticize me for that or people can say whatever they want, but they asked me about Chicago, and I think stop-and-frisk, with good, strong, you know, good, strong law and order. But you have to do something. Itcan continue the wayit going.? Lynch, who spent two stints as chief federal prosecutor in Brooklyn before being nominated as attorney general, said she wasn't opposed to stop-and-frisk techniques under certain circumstances. ""As with every police procedure we want to empower law enforcement to be responsive to community needs. We want to empower them to protect the community. We want to give them the training they need in order to do it in a way that is constitutional, safe and effective and promotes trust,"" Lynch said. ""It?s not really a yes or no answer.""

"When a group of media outlets come out with the same story theme on Trumpit ?coincidence?? When a group of media outlets come out with the same story theme of Trump lies it just has to be a coincidence.That what the New York Times, LA Times and other newspapers would have you believe. It has nothing to do with a preemptive strike. Right. The fact that they follow the talking points from the Clinton staff is proof enough that they are in the bag for Hillary. As Written By LarryO for Hot Air: Over the weekend, several major American newspapers printed a variation of the same article pointing out instances, in their view, when Donald Trump has lied to the American people during the 2016 presidential campaign. The New York Times started the chain reaction on Saturday: ?A Week of Whoppers? Then, the LA Times, Washington Post and Politico followed suit. As CNN media analyst Brian Stelter points out, the publications claim the timing was a coincidence: Several of the editors who were involved said the timing was a coincidence. But there was clearly a desire to publish stories beforeMonday debate, when Trump andClinton truthfulness will surely be at issue. ?Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has,? the L.A. Times declared on page one ofSunday paper. PoliticoMagazine team analyzed every statement made by both Trump and Clinton for five days and said ?the conclusion is inescapable:Trump mishandling of facts and propensity for exaggeration so greatly exceedClinton as to make the comparison almost ludicrous.?Stelter sources also claimed there was no coordination with the Clinton campaign: The four stories were welcomed by the Clinton campaign; aides cited the statistics in television interviews on Sunday. However, there is no indication that the Clinton campaign was involved. Marty Baron, the executive editor of The Washington Post, said the timing of the stories was a coincidence. ?Wedon coordinate coverage with anyone else,? Baron said. So the weekend before the first presidential debate, four major news publications all print the same story, the content and tone of which (calling out one candidate over the other as a serial liar) Stelter concedes is ?extraordinary,? andit all just a coincidencewith no ?",0.034090908999999996,0.0,0.0,0.015151515,0.045454545,0.28030303,0.0,2,-1,1

"There?s already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable ? except by Hillary Clinton. But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong: While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics ?. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage. After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates. The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters: For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator ? to call out those lies and to do that in real time. Unfortunately, withTrump impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods,it somehow up to Hillary Clinton to shineat the debate if she hopes to ?win.? This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent. Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it. If there is one thing this election has shown us,it that journalism is dying, if not already dead. Featured image via Sara D.

"The Democrats are using an intimidation tactic which they are prone to use incessantly. If you question the veracity of a blackpresident birth certificate you are racist. That is the outright claim of Lynn Sweet Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times made on Fox News. Consider the slanted claim that if a president is black and his birth certificate is called into question the conclusion is you must be a racist. What is wrong with this obvious non-sequitur? First of all, there is evidence the birth certificate presented was altered. This is discounted by the claims that whoever presented this must be racist. Secondly, the social security number presented of Barack Obama was issued in Connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there. Third, the hospital that issued his birth certificate in Hawaiididn exist when it was ?issued.? Fourth, an examination of the birth certificate produced several errors that could only be attributed to falsification. Has an unquestioned birth certificate ever been presented?

"Share Tweet Email address: Leave this field empty if you're human: HillaryClinton top aide Huma Abedin recently separated from her husband, Anthony Weiner, after a photo surfaced of Weiner sexting some random chick with their son right next to him. The Bunny Ranch legal brothel responded by offering Weiner a full time position as the director of social media, and we all laughed. But this? This is no laughing matter.It sick. According to that sourcelink, Weiner carried out a months-long online sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl. She claims he asked her to dress up in ?school-girl? outfits and allegedly ?pressed her to engage in ?rape fantasies.'? The girl, whose name is being withheld by DailyMail.com because she is a minor, said the online relationship began last January while she was a high school sophomore and beforeWeiner wife, HillaryClinton aide Huma Abedin, announced she was ended their marriage. Weiner was aware that the girl was underage, according to DailyMail.com interviews with the girl and her father, as well as a cache of online messages. He knew this and sent her completely disgusting, inappropriate messages anyway. He sent her ?bare-chested? photos of himself, called her ?baby,? complimented her body and even told her he woke up hardthinking about her. In one particularly lewd message, he told the teen: ?I would bust that tight p***y so hard and so often that you would leak and limp for a week.? The teen said she originally reached out to Weiner on Twitter in January. She said she was interested in politics and heard about his sexting scandals and wanted to know more about him. It was clear from the messages that she was encouraging Weiner to engage with her in a sexual manner. She told DailyMail.com shedidn consider Weiner her boyfriend, but thought the relationship was a romanticone. She acknowledged during interviews that she had developed an obsession with Weiner, and sought him out on Twitter in January while trying to write a book about him. She said she continued to write the book as their relationship developed. ?Why did I message you [in January]?? the girl wrote in an email to Weiner last week. ?I was studying you- for a book of course. You were my Hannibal Lecter. ?I wanted to know what made you tick. As we chatted, I pretended to not know EVERYTHING about you. Ididn want to appear suspicious.? She also told Weiner: ?I was obsessed with you.? Weiner quickly messaged her back, and they struck up a conversation about the large snowstorms that had hit New York and thegirl home state. From there, he sent her a friend request on Facebook, and the rest is history. The girl told DailyMail.com that she and Weiner first started talking on Skype a few days into the relationship. ?[Weiner?s] son was in the bathtub at the time just downstairs,? she said. ?So he would yell at his son to check on him, and then he asked me to take my clothes off, and just started saying these really sexual things.? Afterward, Weiner sent her a message with a heart-eyed emoji, writing ?I caught a glimpse of your body? and indicating he would like to keep talking over Skype. She claimed the conversations grew more explicit as time went on, with Weiner allegedly asking her to undress and encouraging her to masturbate over video chat. She said Weiner would not get fully nude, but was usually shirtless and wearing boxers. ?He would tell me to say his name as I was touching myself,? said the girl. ?He would ask me to take my clothes off. ?He would just have his shirt off. Sometimes he would grab his lower region, but that was about it,? she added. Weinerdidn deny messaging the teen and refused to address the specific allegations. ?I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent,? Weiner said. ? I am filled with regret and heartbroken for those I have hurt.? Weiner just got 195 times more disgusting. I know. Ididn think it was possible either. If only his first name was Bill and his last name was Clinton. Then everyone would laugh about these sexual escapades. h/t Daily Mail",0.042769857,0.012219958999999999,0.00610998,0.028513238,0.073319756,0.256619145,0.0,2,-1,1
"Huma Abedin dumped her then-husband Anthony Weiner when it was revealed that he had carried on a sexting relationship with another woman ? one of many ? in which he had sent a risqu? picture of himself, and in the picture, he was accompanied by his young son. But unbeknownst to his then-wife and the rest of the world ? but certainly not surprisingly ? he was carrying on another relationship during this time with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. From January to July, he sent photos and vulgar texts to her.I let the New York Post fill you in on the dirty details: The 15-year-old high school student went public with a trove of lurid come-ons she got from Weiner, who exchanged his ?Carlos Danger? persona for the alias ?T Dog? to send her kinky texts and shirtless selfies over a cell-phone messenger app. Weiner repeatedly told the unidentified teen how hardand horny he was, at one point boasting that after sex with him she would, ?limp for a week,? the Daily Mail reported. Weiner ? whose serial sexting cost him his seat in Congress and a comeback bid for mayor ? also shared pornographic videos with her, asked her to get naked and masturbate for him over Skype, and even told her about ?rape fantasies? that grossed her out. [?] The girl said Weiner tried to cover up the sexual nature of their relationship by pressuring her to write a letter to her father and a teacher in whom she had confided, ?and tell them what I said was false.? Even liberal Democrat Governor Andrew Cuomo is disgusted with Weiner. ?If the reports are true,it possibly criminal and it is sick,? he said. ?And frankly,I heard enough about Anthony Weiner, and I think that goes for all New Yorkers.? If Weiner is charged at the federal level with sexual exploitation of children, it carries with it a minimum of 15 years in prison, and a maximum of 30 years. At the state level, disseminating indecent material and promoting the sexual performance of a child could each get him 7 years in jail. In response, Weiner said that he has ?likely been the subject of a hoax,? but as the Post pointed out, hedidn deny any of the allegations against him. In a prepared statement, Weiner said, ?I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement [sic] about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent.

The family was internally displaced, having moved to Bashkateen from another Syrian town, activists said. In east Aleppo, at least 27 people, including two children from one family, were killed by Russian and government airstrikes, according to the observatory. Many were injured and others are missing, the observatory said. Even in this war-weary city, last night's airstrikes were frightening. ?My wife and daughterdidn sleep all night. We were petrified.

Activists claim that the Syrian government and Russia have used napalm, phosphorous and cluster bombs in attacks on Aleppo since the Syrian military declared Monday that the cease-fire had ended. ABC News has not been able to independently verify these claims. Obtained by ABC News One out of only two water-pumping stations in Aleppo was hit overnight, according to local activists. The two stations are under the control of forces opposed to the Syrian government but provide water for both rebel-held eastern Aleppo and government-held western Aleppo. The attacks Thursday and Friday followed an announcement from the Syrian military that it was launching an offensive against eastern Aleppo and offering evacuation corridors for civilians. In the statement, the military urged civilians to stay away from ?locations of armed terrorist groups.? Residents said the government's move is part of a deliberate policy of forced displacement. Meanwhile, eastern Aleppo is still waiting for aid, which was supposed to reach the besieged area during the U.S.-Russia-brokered cease-fire. The truce was broken Monday when an attack on an aid convoy in western Aleppo left at least 21 people dead, including several aid workers. The United Nations has 40 trucks with aid ready to enter eastern Aleppo. The aid has been sitting by the Turkish border since the beginning of last week and is still waiting by the border in Syria customs area. Once the U.N. gets the green light, the first convoy carrying a month's worth of wheat flour for more than 150,000 people will be sent to Aleppo, according to the U.N.?s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The shipment will be followed up by a delivery of enough food rations to feed 35,000 people for a month. ?The recent upsurge of violence in east Aleppo is obviously a concern for us. However, we are standby,? David Swanson, spokesman for the U.N.?s humanitarian affairs office, told ABC News. ?As humanitarians on the front line we are ready to move. It is now up to the politicians to make this a reality.? The distance from the Turkish border to east Aleppo is only some 40 miles, but the journey could take about four to five hours.

"Hillary Clinton has a 9-point advantage over Donald Trump. | AP Photo Poll: Clinton leads Trump in New Hampshire Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump in thenation smallest battleground state, according to a new Monmouth University poll of likely voters in New Hampshire released on Wednesday. The poll, which was conducted last Saturday through Tuesday, shows Clinton with a 9-point advantage over Trump, 47 percent to 38 percent. Libertarian Gary Johnson is at 10 percent, Green Party nominee Jill Stein garners 1 percent, and another 3 percent of likely voters are undecided. New Hampshire will only award 4 electoral votes this fall. But the state has outsized importance in the battle for the Senate, and the Monmouth poll shows incumbent GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte with a slim, 2-point lead over her Democratic challenger, popular Gov. Maggie Hassan, 47 percent to 45 percent. That is well within thepoll margin of error: plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. And Republicans also have an early lead in thegovernor race, after both parties selected their nominees in lastweek primaries. Republican Chris Sununu leads his relatively unknown Democratic opponent, Colin Van Ostern, 49 percent to 43 percent. In the presidential race, Clinton leads Trump because more Democrats (94 percent) have lined up behind the former secretary of state than Republicans (85 percent) who are supporting Trump. Clinton also leads among independents, 42 percent to 35 percent. Neither Clinton nor Trump is popular, butTrump negatives outweighClinton. Thirty-six percent of likely voters have a favorable opinion of Clinton, while 56 percent view her unfavorably.Trump favorable rating is lower: 30 percent favorable, compared to 63 percent unfavorable. It's another in a series of polls this week that show Clinton regaining some momentum after losing ground last week amid the fallout of her ""basket of deplorables"" comment and pneumonia diagnosis. Monmouth has also showed Clinton leading Trump by 5 points in vote-rich Florida, and within striking distance in Georgia, which has been reliably Republican in recent elections. Both candidates in the Senate race are well liked: Half of likely voters approve of how Ayotte is handling her job as senator, and 38 percent disapprove.Hassan approval rating is even higher: Sixty percent approve of the second-termgovernor job performance, and only 31 percent disapprove. Neither candidate in the gubernatorial race is well known, but Sununu ? whose father, John, served three terms as governor in the 1980s, and brother, also named John, served a term in the Senate last decade ? has higher name ID. Thirty-six percent of likely voters have a favorable opinion of Sununu, 22 percent view him unfavorably, and 41 percent have no opinion of the Republican. But Van Ostern is little known: Twenty-eight percent view him favorably, and only 6 percent have an unfavorable opinion. But roughly 2-in-3 voters, 66 percent, have no opinion of the Democratic nominee.

"Gov. Chris Christie greets residents at a gathering in Camden, N.J. | AP Photo/Mel Evans Christie among the most unpopular governors in the country, poll finds Gov. Chris Christie has the third-worst approval ratings of any governor in the country, according to a poll released Tuesday. According to Morning Consult, New Jersey voters give Christie a 29 percent approval rating and 68 percent disapproval rating. That's down from a 36 percent approval rating in the spring, and not far behind the two worst ranked governors. Story Continued Below Republican Sam Brownback of Kansas fares the worst, with a 23 percent approval rating and 71 percent disapproval rating. Democrat Dan Malloy of Connecticut has a 26 percent approval rating and a 70 percent disapproval rating. The numbers in the Morning Consult poll are actually slightly better for Christie than a Rutgers-Eagleton poll released Monday, which showed 26 percent of voters approving of his job performance and 69 percent disapproving, while just 23 percent said they had a favorable opinion of the governor. Both surveys were conducted before the Bridgegate trial got underway on Monday ? a spectacle that has already proven embarrassing for Christie amid the prosecution's claims that he knew of the George Washington Bridge access lane closings as they happened. There is a potential consolation for Christie in the Morning Consult poll. Two Republicans he helped elect in blue states against long odds as chairman of the Republican Governors Association are among the most popular in the country. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan both have 70 percent approval ratings and disapproval ratings of 18 percent and 17 percent, respectively. Only Republican South Dakota Gov.

"A Daisy of a Rerun I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her. The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson approvedthat message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly ?war mongering? opponent, Barry Goldwater. Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisitingJohnson deceitful war policies,Goldwater vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from ourNation media. I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign. Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a Daisyremake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers. Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweighGoldwater 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events. Instead,today voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as ?news and views.? With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, themedia reaction of ridicule was to be expected. Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailingTed ?dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.? This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a ?pathological liar? and ?utterly amoral.? As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of ??Lyin Ted,? insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.? These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder. Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph? Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say derogatorywhen regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the ?liberal press? moniker has now everyday acceptance. It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for thepublic re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation. Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format andr?s of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion. These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections. With that, consider thePresident past considerations oftoday democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, ?She will say anything and change nothing. Hillarycan be trusted andisn qualified to be President.? Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent,it damning, given the time frame. Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: ?If youcan run your own house, you certainlycan run the White House.? Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review. Again,wouldn it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

"Over the past several months, the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. Well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed ?watered down? drugs to third-world countries. From The Daily Caller: Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed ?watered-down? HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and ?likely increased? the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. ? The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the ClintonFoundation most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. ? The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate HillaryClinton campaign. ? The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the ClintonFoundation vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

"When Chesapeake School Board Chairwoman Christie New Craig shared a provocative political cartoon to her personal Facebook page in August of 2015, Muslims in her state of Virginia immediately used it as an opportunity to complain about racism, discrimination and Islamophobia. ?Muslims hate pork, beer, dogs, bikinis, Jesus, and freedom of speech,? the cartoon read. ?My question is, what the hell do they come to America for?!? When questioned by reporters at The Virginian-Pilot, Craig maintained that she did not share the cartoon ?maliciously.? ?I merely shared it,? she told WAVY-TV. ?I did not make a comment, andI just shocked with everything going on in our country ? police officers are losing their lives, people are homeless and peopledon have jobs ? that a political cartoon would cause this much stir.?

According to an email sent by organizers of the Trump press pool, the campaign said it was the Secret Service's decision to remove the press pool from the motorcade as their resources are being stretched too thin amid a ""heightened state of security"" to keep the press' plane clean. ""We have communicated that this is an issue that the campaign should have spotted long ago and are vigorously protesting the decision,"" an email from the pool chairs said. ""We have told the campaign that if they are truly committed to transparency, than [sic] they should place the pool on Trump's plane so it is a truly protective pool. They have not been responsive to that request."" On Monday, the journalists following Trump began to fly on a new ""chase"" plane which would more closely follow Trump's plane, and were told they would now travel within the Trump motorcade. The move, which the campaign said was in the works for weeks, was expected to help prevent instances such as last week, when Trump's press pool, caught in traffic on the way from a different airport, was late to a Trump rally in New Hampshire. Instead of delaying his rally, Trump mocked the press for being late. By not being in the motorcade, the pool will have to contend with normal traffic, making it more likely that they could miss or be late to other events. The Trump press pool has been lobbying to travel with Trump on his plane, a move which would solve these logistical problems, and one his campaign has signaled will likely never happen. Nearly all previous presidential candidates, including Hillary Clinton, have their traveling press corps with them on their planes by this point in the campaign. The reversal is the latest in a series of events that has seriously frustrated the reporters who cover Trump. From the campaign blacklisting certain outlets, to the candidate himself calling out certain reporters he feels are unfair (NBC's Katy Tur was once escorted out of a rally by Secret Service for her own protection after Trump called her out), the reporters following Trump have had to deal with a seemingly never-ending series of roadblocks. One of the few positives of Trump's relationship with the media had been that despite the blacklists, he still held many news conferences and gaggles and managed to sit for interviews with a wide range of outlets at any time of day or night. Now those interviews and news conferences have been drastically reduced. Trump has over the past two months mostly stuck to appearances on Fox News, and hasn't held a formal news conference where he takes questions in more than 54 days (he held a small gaggle with reporters on his plane a couple weeks ago). In an ironic contrast, Clinton, who famously went months without a formal news conference has now held several in the past couple of weeks. Secret Service spokeswoman Catherine Milhoan declined to specify whether it was the campaign or the Secret Service's decision to keep the pool from the motorcade. ""Historically, the Secret Service has not provided resources to maintain the security of a secondary aircraft used for the domestic transport of press,"" Milhoan said. ""In regards to aircraft security, the Secret Service is only responsible for maintaining the integrity of the protectees aircraft and those accompanying him or her on that aircraft.""

"During Mondaynight presidential debate, Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump of screwing thousands of his workers out of the wages that they owe him. It was a shining moment for Clinton, that highlighted howTrump entire fortune comes from not his business savvy, but his unending greed and eagerness to exploit anyone he can. Before saying that she is glad that Trump never did business with her father, she directly told Trump that he needed to apologize to all those he hurt, saying: ?Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods thatthey produced and then refused to pay them?? One of those people that Trump stiffed over is an architect named Andrew Tesoro. Tesoro sat down for an interview on MSNBC Live, where he revealed how Trump did not pay him the $100,000 dollars that were owed to him for helping to a clubhouse at one ofTrump many golf courses. Tesoro was asked whether he was paid for the work he had done on the clubhouse. He responded by saying: ?No, hedidn. He paid partially along the way and the project snowballed over a four year period and our role in the project snowballed as well. We became very much involved in interior design and construction stage work. We made many supplemental agreements as we went along and in the end those agreements were not honored.? Because Trump will do anything to distance himself from his fraudulent business practices, he recently asserted that Tesoro probablywasn paid because of shoddy work. That comment should really be biting him in the ass now.That because Tesoro revealed that Trump had written him a letter of recommendation in 2006. In the letter, Trump praised Tesoro for his work.Tesser experience is not unique. It seems like every day that more people are coming out in droves and exposing the various ways that Trump has royally screwed them over. One report has been particularly damning. USA Today found that Trump has been involved in over 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades. They also found that he has left everyone from cabinetmakers to carpenters left without being paid in full, or on time. While those numbers certainly make it easier to understand how far reachingTrump fraudulent practices are, hearing it from someone who was a victim of them makes it so much more real.

"Story highlights A new poll finds a widespread lack of enthusiasm for the 2016 presidential candidates Just 11% of voters overall say they would feel excited if Trump were to win; 12% feel that way about Clinton (CNN) Even if their preferred candidate wins, a new poll released Wednesday found that supporters of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will feel more relief than excitement. The findings from the Pew Research Center revealed widespread disenchantment toward this year's presidential contest among American voters. Majorities of voters say they are frustrated (57%) and disgusted (55%) with the campaign, dwarfing those who say they are interested (31%), optimistic (15%) and excited (10%). Those lukewarm attitudes even extend to backers of the two major party nominees. Only 25% of Clinton supporters say they would feel excited if she were to win. There was little more enthusiasm among Trump supporters; just 28% would be excited if the GOP nominee triumphs in November. But many more Clinton supporters, 68%, say they would feel relieved if she were to win. Ditto for Trump supporters, 61% of whom say they would also feel relief if he wins. According to Pew, a mere 11% of voters overall say they would feel excited if Trump were to win, virtually the same number (12%) who would be excited if the former secretary of state is victorious.

"We are heading into yet another day of unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, and one GOP congressman is blaming the victims of systemic racism that lead to the deaths of so many black people at the hands of those sworn to serve and protect in the most blatantly racist way yet.

Pittenger said that the protesters: ?The grievance in their minds, the animus, the anger. They hate white people because white people are successful andthey not.? Yes, he actually said that. Here is video of the statement, via BBC NewsNight on Twitter: As if thatweren bad enough, Pittenger went on to say: ?We have spent trillions of dollars on welfare, andwe put people in bondage, so theycan be allthey capable of being.? Of course, the backlash was swift, leading the fool who should never be allowed to hold any position of power whatsoever to quickly try and pretend thatisn what he really meant, that heisn really a racist. He insisted that he is simply upset, that ?what is taking place in my hometown right now breaks my heart.? He also said, ?My anguish led me to respond to areporter question in a way that I regret.? Pittenger, a die-hard Trumpkin, insists that heisn racist eh? No, Rep. Pittenger, you ARE racist. Anyone whoisn would even think such a thing in response to these protests, much less say it. Face it ?you a racist. You and the rest of the GOP can whine and complain anytime someone calls you on your ignorance and bigotry all you want ? we all know the truth, right from your own mouths.

"Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group ISIS and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the CIA and DIA, as far back as 2012. And purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria. According to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the ""leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an ?Islamic State? in Iraq and Syria.? ObviouslyObama dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a JVteam and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error. However the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi. And the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports. However whatisn in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.

"4954 SHARES SHARES FacebookTwitter GooglePinterestDiggLinkedin Reddit Stumbleupon PrintDeliciousPocketTumblr For weeks, Donald Trump and his henchmen have tried to paint a picture of Hillary Clinton that suggestsshe physically and mentally unfit to be the next president. Whenever Clinton coughed, they would claim she had one foot in the grave. When she fainted on 9/11, Trump and his people were pounced with glee. Then we discover she tried to tough it out with walking pneumonia, and suddenly they turned that into an attack on her honesty. So going into the presidential debates, everyone was waiting for Trump to unleash some sort of attack onClinton health. And once it started to become apparent that he was losing the debate, the billionaire did just that. When addressing the issue of race in America, Trump said: ?You look at the inner cities, and I just left Detriot, and I just left Philidelphia. And Ijust know.You seen meI been all over the place. Uh, You decided to stay home and I meanthatokay I will tell you.I been all over andI met some of the greatest peopleI ever meet within these communities. And they are very very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.?Clinton response was perfect. ?I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes I did. And you know what else I prepared for?? There was a slight pause before she continued: ?I prepared to be president and I thinkthat a good thing.? The expression onTrump face followingClinton comeback was priceless. See for yourself. Some critics pointed out thatClinton ?gotcha line? came off as rehearsed. Butisn that sort of the point she was making? The point is that Clinton did rehearse, she studied, and prepared, not just for one debate, but also for an important job that entails far more significant consequences for bad decisions than low TV ratings and lawsuits. America saw just who the real adult was in this contest and at the end of the daythat the person you hire to do the most important job in the world. Featured image via YouTube.

Trent Franks backed Ted Cruz during the GOP presidential primary, but he now has a message for the Texas Republican: Get in line behind Donald Trump.

""I have five rules for political endorsements,"" said Steve Deace, an Iowa radio talk show host who was an outspoken Cruz backer during the primary. ""And Cruz endorsing Trump violates every single one of them."" Less than two months until Election Day, Trump has once again put Cruz in a bind. As Trump's poll numbers rise and now is neck-and-neck against Clinton, the GOP nominee's backers are looking for every last ounce of support to showcase that there is momentum and energy behind his campaign. If Trump falls short of Clinton by a narrow margin, Trump's backers are bound to blame holdouts like Cruz for failing to do more to help their party.

" Usually, nobody says Trump is ready for battle louder thanTrump senior advisor Rudy Giuliani, but after his candidate suffered a bruising defeat last night at the hands of HillaryClinton, the histrionic former New York Mayor had a different solution for his fact-less Republican nominee. Giuliani knows that the racist Republican nominee cannot possibly win any debate involving facts, so he told NBC whathe do if possible: ?If I were Donald Trump Iwouldn participate in another debate unless I was promised that a journalist would act like a journalist and not an incorrect, ignorant fact checker.?That right. Trump should drop out of the debates because facts are hard. The Hill reported specifically that the former prosecutor Giuliani was most upset over LesterHolt accurate fact check (that even NYPD agreed with) that ?stop and frisk,? as practiced under his watch in New York, was definitively declared unconstitutional by a judge: ?If journalism has ethics, Lester Holt unethically interfering in the area of law he knows nothing about,? Giuliani said. ?It is not unconstitutional andTrump description of that case was correct.? When the two tangled, it was always about the facts, and each time Lester Holt stood solely on the sturdiest ground. Republicansaren enamored with facts, and often try to pretend recorded statementsdon exist, so itwasn surprising that Giuliani tried to backtrack instantly to NBC. After realizing thathe just made ?Spin Room? headlines, he said ?I did not say whatI advising,I saying what I would do. Whatever advice I give to Donald Trump,I give to Donald Trump.? Lester Holt did an acceptable job as moderator last night, upsetting partisans on both sides while managing not to blow any key moments with odd remarks or lasting moments of shame. The Republican nominee made several desperate ?hail mary throw? sales pitches to the American people last night, but outside of his base it played disastrously.

Who wants to be blamed for being a racist murderer when you are not one? It just does not matter anymore. In this country, police are guilty until proven innocent in the eye of the public court of opinion. There have been police that have abused their power and those ones have been punished. But so many others along the way have been demonized by leftist media and terrorist activist groups like Black Lives Matter and the New Black Panthers. Wecan even agree as a people what is proper procedure for police. For instance, if you are told by police to stop moving, to stop moving your hands, to stop reaching your hands into places? is it then credible for an officer to use deadly force? BLM would say absolutely not. But why? Could a suspect be reaching for a gun? Yes. So many officers have been gunned down in exactly that type of scenario. Yet BLM and its followers demand that the officers talk their way out of situations like that. They demand that they use a taser. They demand that they shoot them in the leg. They demand a whole lot of stupid crap that they themselves would NEVER demand of themselves. What is justifiable self-defense to sane folks is straight out murder to others.

As Bloomberg reported back in 2014: ?To reduce the tax pinch, the Clintons are using financial planning strategies befitting the top 1 percent of U.S. households in wealth.? In 2010 the Clinton created ?residential trusts? and the following year moved their Chappaqua estate into the trust, according to their financial records.

"The pressure is on Hillary Clinton. Insiders in both parties agree: Clinton, having lost most of her lead over the past few weeks and bringing more experience to the stage, faces higher expectations than Donald Trump when the two square off for the first debate on Long Island. Story Continued BelowThat according to The POLITICO Caucus ? a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 11 key battleground states. Roughly equal percentages of Democrats (69 percent) and Republicans (74 percent) said Clinton is under more pressure to perform than Trump. But Democrats mostly lamented the low expectations for Trump, a relative political neophyte who has exhibited little command of the issues. ?She shouldn't be [under more pressure], but so long as he avoids standing on stage and vomiting on himself, the press will give Trump a glowing review,? said a Nevada Democrat ? who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. ?Hillary will need a strong performance to demonstrate that she passes and Trump fails the commander-in-chief test.? ?The media and Trump himself have set the bar too low for Trump,? a New Hampshire Democrat added. ?Presidents don't get graded on a curve, and candidates in debates shouldn't be either.? One Ohio Democrat detected a double standard for the first female major-party nominee. ?Hillary Clinton has spent a public lifetime of being held to a strikingly different standard, and this debate will be no exception,? said the Ohio Democrat. ?She will have to answer every single question flawlessly, exude gravitas, look presidential, channel Bill's and Barack's oratorical mastery, not raise her voice, not cough, wear an acceptable pantsuit, smile enough, be likable, not laugh and have a good hair day. Donald Trump will just have to show up.? Republicans also said Clinton was under greater scrutiny on Monday night, but for different reasons: tightening polls that show Trump eclipsing Clinton in some battleground states. ?Somehow she needs to reverse the trend,? said an Ohio Republican. ?Never seen anyone do it before. This will be her chance ? and maybe her last chance.? ?She has to stop [Trump?s] momentum with a strong debate performance, and she has to be able to stand on the stage for 90 minutes and look healthy for 90 minutes or the whole issue of her health comes back with a vengeance,? added a Virginia Republican. ?All [Trump] has to do is not say anything racist or sexist and look like he could be president.? Among those insiders who said Trump was under more pressure ? 31 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of Republicans ? most pointed to the GOPnominee volatile personality. ?Hillary Clinton is expected to do well. She is a policy wonk,? said a Michigan Republican. ?The pressure is on Donald Trump not to lose his cool. He has been doing very well in his public appearances, but that is with the assistance of a TelePrompTer. He will have no such help at the debate, and if I were coaching Hillary Clinton, I would be encouraging her to get him as riled up as possible. To win the debate, all Trump really needs to do is meet expectations, keep his cool, and look presidential.? ?The question we are all waiting to have answered is: Can he be serious?? added a Michigan Democrat. ?Can he answer questions directly? How will he react (or overreact) when he is directly challenged? Can he control his temper?? Two other takeaways from the pre-debate survey: Most insiders expect Clinton to winthe debate. Majorities in both parties peg Clinton as most likely to be the victor on Monday night: 76 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of Republicans. ?Media look at who best answered questions, and that will likely be Hillary,? said an Iowa Republican. ?[Clinton?s] mastery of issues and policies and no-nonsense delivery will prevail over bluster, name-calling and promises that can never be kept,? added a New Hampshire Democrat. But not all Democrats were so optimistic about Clinton ? or the media through which voters will interpret the debate. ?The press wants Trump to win,? said a Florida Democrat. ?Their disdain for her, plus desire to keep the race alive, means unless he really screws up, they'll give him the win on the most absurd grade curve ever.? Some Republicans also claimed media bias ? in the other direction. ?The media has never been more in the tank for a candidate in modern history: CNN, NBC, ABC and POLITICO will all say she won,? a Virginia Republican said. ?But then again everyone also 'knew' that Carter beat Reagan in their debate as well.? Insiders think the debate will matter. Asked whether they expect the debate to have a significant impact on the race, most insiders in both parties think it will generate momentum for one of the candidates. Among Democratic insiders, 66 percent believe Clinton will benefit from the debate, 11 percent think Trump will get a bounce and 23 percentdon expect the debate to move the needle. ?Trump will flounder, ramble and lie (because he always does),? a Michigan Democrat predicted. ?The moderators will challenge him, and he'll get mad. He'll complain afterwards that they picked on him and favored Hillary. First impressions are hard to shake off, and this won't go well for him.? The numbers were flipped for Republicans, with slightly less enthusiasm for the GOP standard-bearer: 52 percent think the debate will help Trump, 26 percent think it will help Clinton and 22 percent said itwouldn have a significant impact. ?Trump has the most to gain by appearing presidential and even-tempered,? said a New Hampshire Republican. ?He does that successfully, and he cuts into Hillary's greatest strength.? But some Republicans said Clinton could stuntTrump momentum with a strong performance Monday night. ?If she pins his ears back, [it helps her],? said an Iowa Republican. ?If it's a draw, it's a net negative for her. She has to have something to stop his momentum. She's got to hit him with a brick.? Other insiders, however, doubted whether the debate would have a significant, permanent effect on the race. ?We're past the era of the big debate swings: the bloodless Dukakis death penalty answer, the Reagan age quip, the Bentsen 'you're no John Kennedy' moments,? an Iowa Republican said. ?Swing voters are like the California Condor, a critically endangered species disappearing at an alarming rate. Opinion media, partisan polarization, and two highly unpopular candidates make this a battle over a very small group of voters in about a dozen states, and whatever bounce comes out of this debate will dissipate as quickly as it appears.?

"Story highlights Lawmakers are trying to wrap up negotiations on Zika funding A swath of other thorny issues is complicating the talks (CNN) Lawmakers hoping for a quick resolution in the talks to fund the government and provide a federal response to Zika were disappointed Monday when negotiators, who had worked through the weekend, said they would need more time to agree to a deal. ""Everything's a little up in the (air),"" Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a member of the Republican leadership told reporters crowded outside his office waiting for word of an agreement. ""Hope springs eternal."" With no deal at hand, Senate leaders delayed until at least Tuesday a procedural vote to begin debate on the bill in hopes it might be ready then. In one sign of possible progress late Monday, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, who is a member of the Democratic leadership, told reporters that negotiators had resolved a key sticking point over language in the Zika measure that would prevent funds from going to a Planned Parenthood partner in Puerto Rico, something Democrats strongly oppose.

"Neal West stood outside Bernie Sanders? event at Kent State University on Saturday and asked people leaving to consider voting for the GreenParty candidate, Jill Stein, though he knew full well that inside, the senator had repeated his call for his fans to vote for Clinton. Interested in Bernie Sanders? Add Bernie Sanders as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Bernie Sanders news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest West said that he voted for Sanders in the primary and that, in his opinion, Stein was closer to Sanders than Clinton on the issues. As he passed out flyers, he rejected the key argument from Sanders that in a battleground state like Ohio, where polls have the two major candidates neck and neck, he should vote for Clinton to stave off a Trump win. ?If the Democratic Party had chosen a candidate that everybody would support, then therewouldn be an issue at all with Trump winning,? he said. Asked specifically if he worried about Trump winning, West went on: ?That has nothing to do with me.? It remains to be seen whether Bernie Sanders, the choice candidate on many college campuses during the primary season, will be an effective surrogate for Hillary Clinton, who urgently needs the student and millennial vote. While stumping for Clinton at two universities in Ohio over the weekend, Sanders spent minimal time making a case for Clinton, but instead focused his remarks on why voters should reject her opponent. Sanders spoke passionately against Donald Trump. He accused the Republican Party nominee of rejecting science and trying to delegitimize BarackObama presidency. ?You want to disagree with Obama? Disagree with Obama. But do not go around putting a lot of money into trying to tell the American people that because we have an African American who happens to be president today that he is not a legitimate president,? the senator said while speaking at Akron University. ?That is an awful and divisive and terrible thing to do.? But when talking about his former primary opponent, the Vermont senator primarily compared Clinton to Trump or listed ways in which she agrees with his own signature policy proposals on college affordability and health care. ?Hillary Clinton and I believe that the time is now to ask the wealthiest people and the largest corporations to start paying their fair share of taxes,? he said during his swing through the battleground state. However, recent polling suggests that when it comes to winning the youth vote (a key demographic for President Obama) perhapsClinton greatest challenge is not Trump, but other third-party candidates. In the most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll, only 40 percent of adults under 30 years old backed Clinton in the general election -- a stark contrast from the 60 percent that Obama won in 2012. This is largely because one in three adults under 30 say they plan to vote for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein -- or not vote at all. But enthusiasm also matters: even months after the Democratic primary process wrapped up, 60 percent of Democratic adults under 30 say they wish that Bernie Sanders had won the nomination. In fact, only a quarter of them say they wanted Clinton to win the nod. During a listening tour across the state of Ohio, ABC News found that college students were much quicker to bring up the third-party options. Before hitting the campaign trail again, Sanders specifically urged his supporters not to back third-party candidates. ?Now is not the time to be supporting a protest vote,? he said during an interview on MSNBC. ?Right now we have to make sure Trump does not become president and Clinton is the person to beat him.? During a campaign stop at Temple University on Tuesday, Clinton appealed to students who may still have reservations about her. ?Even if you are totally opposed to Donald Trump you may still have some questions about me. I get that,? she said. ?And I want to do my best to answer those questions.? While speaking on campuses, both Clinton and Sanders emphasized getting to the polls. Sanders told students they should not just vote, but volunteer and get involved with politics. ?If we have a large voter turnout, for Secretary Clinton and Ted Strickland [the Democratic nominee for Senate in Ohio] here in Ohio and the entire nation will be very gratified for what you do,"" Sanders said.",0.036659878,0.00407332,0.012219958999999999,0.010183299,0.079429735,0.297352342,0.0,2,-1,1
"""Wars like the savagery in Syria must be brought to an end,"" President Barack Obama said. | AP Photo Obama urges nations to open arms to refugees NEW YORK ? President Barack Obama called on nations to ""welcome the stranger"" on Tuesday during a much-touted gathering on refugees aimed at rallying support for the record 65 million people displaced around the world. He also managed to take a veiled shot at Donald Trump. Story Continued Below The U.S.-sponsored summit, which drew a number of private sector participants, was one of two major refugee-related gatherings this week on the margins of the annual U.N. General Assembly meeting. The events took place as New York-area authorities pursued and caught an Afghan-born bombing suspect, the hunt for whom fueled the debate in the U.S. presidential race over refugees. Trump has slammed Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for her openness to taking in refugees and other immigrants. (One of Trump's sons, in a tweet that provoked backlash on Monday, compared refugees to poisonous Skittles.) Clinton has defended her stance, while calling for proper vetting of all who enter the U.S. In a subtle rebuke of the Republican nominee's promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, Obama framed the world's response to the refugee crisis as ""a test of our common humanity ? whether we give into suspicion and fear and build walls or whether we see ourselves in one another."" The president also spoke of the cause of one of the biggest refugee crises today: the war in Syria. But he gave no indication he was willing to consider a greater U.S. military role to help end that conflict. ""Wars like the savagery in Syria must be brought to an end,"" he said, adding that it must be ""through political settlements and diplomacy, not simply by bombing."" The White House unveiled a series of commitments from the international community in response to the call for action from Obama and other allies in the United Nations. They include some $650 million, including in-kind contributions, from more than 50 private-sector entities. The largest share was a $500 million investment pledge from billionaire George Soros, who wrote in The Wall Street Journal that he will pump money into ""startups, established companies, social-impact initiatives and businesses founded by migrants and refugees themselves."" Ahead of this week's summits, the Obama administration announced the United States will take in 110,000 refugees from around the world, including a ""significant"" number of Syrians, in the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. That figure disappointed refugee advocates who'd hoped the administration would take it closer to 200,000 refugees. The president is, after all, urging other countries to double their intake, and a growing number of countries have stepped up to take refugees for the first time or expand their resettlement programs. In the fiscal year wrapping up this month, the U.S. will have accepted 85,000 refugees. Still, advocacy groups have expressed overall strong support for the U.S.-sponsored summit, saying it will achieve concrete results. Activists were less impressed with a U.N.-sponsored refugee summit held Monday, which kicked down the road until 2018 many difficult decisions about how the global community should handle migration crises.",0.01754386,0.002506266,0.0,0.010025063,0.042606516,0.308270677,0.005012531,2,-1,1
"As police today captured the man wanted for questioning in connection to a series of explosive devices in New York City and New Jersey, new information about him has begun to emerge. Interested in New York? Add New York as an interest to stay up to date on the latest New York news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest The man, Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, was born in 1988 in Afghanistan and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, according to the FBI. He was discovered and captured in Linden, New Jersey, not far from his last known address in Elizabeth. New Jersey State Police A U.S. official initially told ABC News Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000, but his father later said the family came over in 1995. Court records indicate Ahmad Rahami was from a large family and may have as many as seven siblings. Former classmates said he attended Edison High School in New Jersey. One of them, Chris Konya, said Rahami was quiet but funny and a ""pretty normal guy."" Konya and another former classmate said Rahami had a child with his high school girlfriend. Rahami was enrolled at Middlesex County College from fall of 2010 to fall of 2012, where he worked toward an associate's degree in criminal justice but did not graduate, according to school officials. New Jersey State Police The Rahami family owned a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth. An employee and a recent customer said Rahami worked there. ""I come in here every week or two, just to get something to eat,"" local resident Ryan McCann told The Associated Press. ""He's always in there. He's a very friendly guy. That's what's so scary. It's hard when it's home."" Members of the Rahami family apparently did not get along well with the local police and sued several officers in 2011 for allegedly harassing them over purported violations related the restaurant's operation. The case was dismissed in 2012, pending the resolution of a related legal matter, according to documents. Investigators are poring over Rahami's past travel, including what may have been a recent nearly year-long trip in which he flew to Quetta, Pakistan in April 2013 and returned to the U.S. through the United Arab Emirates in March 2014, according to the U.S. official. Rahami reported to authorities that he was visiting his wife and family, who he said were Afghan refugees living in Quetta, and that he had traveled by car between Pakistan and Afghanistan. New Jersey State Police In August 2014 Rahami was arrested after allegedly stabbing someone in the leg, according to court documents. A complaint filed by a police officer said the officer ""has reason to believe that the person is a danger to himself, others or property,"" but Rahami was not indicted. Today Rahami was shot at least once by police during an exchange of gunfire before he was captured and then taken to a local hospital, authorities said. He is not cooperating with investigators, even so far as refusing to give his name, according to a source briefed on the case. Officials said they have not determined a motive for the attacks. Late Monday officials announced charges against Rahami related to the shootout with police: five counts of attempted murder, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Bail has been set at $5.2 million. It is unclear if Rahami has an attorney. A senior Afghan official told ABC News the Afghan government is ready to assist the U.S. in any way it can and is searching for any information it may have on Rahami. New Jersey State Police ABC News' Cindy Galli, Megan Christie, Randy Kreider, Alex Hosenball and Cho Park contributed to this report. [Editor's Note Sept. 28, 2016: The original version of this report said that Ahmad Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000. Rahami's father later told ABC News, however, that his son and the family came in 1995 and that Rahami received his Green Card in 2000.]",0.034836066,0.00204918,0.006147540999999999,0.008196721,0.057377049000000006,0.254098361,0.0,2,-1,1
"Both women are former models, but Alicia Machado attacked Melania Trump for failing to do more to help those around her as the wife of a prominent political figure. | Getty Former Miss Universe sizes up Melania Trump: 'I think I speak more English' Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe who vaulted into the political spotlight Monday night as the latest example of DonaldTrump derogatory remarks about women, said the GOPnominee wife, Melania, is ?a decoration? with limited English-speaking skills. In an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine published Tuesday, Machado drew a clear line between her own immigration story and that of Melania Trump. Both women are former models, but Machado attacked Melania Trump for failing to do more to help those around her as the wife of a prominent political figure. Story Continued Below ?I think I speak more English than her,? Machado said. ?Idon see anything about this girl.She a doll.She a decoration. That is how I see her.? Donald Trump was harshly critical of Machado during her tenure as Miss Universe, calling her Miss Piggy and Miss Housekeeping, the latter a reference to her Hispanic heritage. Machado told Cosmopolitan that those remarks triggered a relapse of her bulimia that took several years to escape. Machado, who was also crowned Miss Venezuela, became an American citizen in August, something she told Cosmopolitan she did specifically to vote against Trump. Tuesday morning, Trump admitted that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had gotten under his skin a little bit by bringing up Machado at the debate. He said the pageant winner ?gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem.? ?That person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst.

"New York  Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both met with world leaders in town for the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, but the two presidential contenders did so with vastly different goals. Both Clinton and Trump met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi Monday, as the grueling presidential contest enters its final weeks. Clinton, who served for four years as President Barack Obama's secretary of state, also met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. While the stakes are high for both candidates, there is likely more on the line for Trump who, as a foreign policy novice, is still looking to prove his chops before the first presidential debate next Monday. Trump used the meetings to try to convince voters that despite his often explosive personality he is qualified to serve as commander in chief. The key for the blunt businessman is the visuals of the meeting, hoping that voters see a president as they observe him with a world leader. ""I will say that with all the folks being in New York, I've had a lot of calls from a lot of different people on the basis that I'm doing well and, you know, they seem to think it's important to maybe meet,"" Trump said Monday on Fox News. ""I don't want to comment specifically on who but a couple of people are coming over."" He later said, ""I've already met with a couple,"" but refused to say which ones. Clinton used the meetings with the three world leaders, in contrast, to stress her facility with high-level diplomacy gained by years of experience on the world stage. Her meetings are also certain to be watched in various parts of the world for signs of how she would direct US foreign policy as president. Clinton addressed prickly topics with each world leader, according to aides in the room. Clinton touched on North Korea and the rise of China with Japan's Abe, while Clinton addressing the need for a more vibrant -- and free -- civil society with Egypt while she met with Sisi. While reporters were in the room, Clinton told Sisi that she looked forward to talking about the ""path we are taking in order to build up a new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law, that respects human rights and liberties."" Trump also met with Sisi on Monday evening in New York where the two discussed ""the strategic bilateral relationship between the US and Egypt,"" according to a Trump campaign statement after the meeting. Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (ret.), two of Trump's top foreign policy advisers, joined Trump for the meeting. ""Mr. Trump expressed to President el-Sisi his strong support for Egypt's war on terrorism, and how under a Trump administration, the United States of America will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that Egypt can count on in the days and years ahead,"" the Trump campaign said. The Republican nominee, who has faced widespread condemnation in the Muslim world for his proposal to ban Muslims from the U.S. and his blanket statements about Islam, also shared his ""high regard for peace-loving Muslims,"" the campaign added. The campaign also said Trump called the US-Egypt relationship ""vital to help promote peace and stability in the Middle East."" Sisi is the second foreign leader Trump has met with since becoming the Republican nominee. He first met with the Mexican president in Mexico last month. Sitting with Poroshenko, Clinton said she was looking forward to talking about the challenges Ukraine faces, primarily ""the very real problems and threats from Russian aggression."" Clinton added that she was ""anxious to know how we can be supportive of those efforts."" Clinton's meetings were announced before Trump's, and a senior advisor to the former top diplomat said Friday that they were less about furthering a political argument than preparing her to hit the ground running immediately if she wins the White House. ""If she is elected, she wants to be sure she is prepared (not only) to handle the challenges but to seize the opportunities on Day One,"" said a senior Clinton advisor granted anonymity to talk about her foreign policy views. ""While she has remained a candidate, she is also focused on what it would take to govern if she wins."" The meetings also set up possible contrasts that could pose a challenge for Trump given Clinton's lengthy record on the international stage as both secretary of state and first lady. Trump has tried to shore up his foreign policy credentials before, taking a trip last month to meet Mexican President EnriquePe Nieto earlier this year. The meeting ended awkwardly after Trump said they never talked about his proposed border wall, butPe Nieto said he told Trump during the meeting that Mexico would not pay for it. Clinton's campaign seized on the public back-and-forth between the Mexican leader and Trump, with the Democratic nominee calling it Trump's ""embarrassing international incident."" ""When you see that he can't even go to a foreign country without getting into a public feud with the president, I think the answer is clear: Donald Trump does not have the temperament to be our commander in chief,"" Clinton told voters in Ohio after the meeting. For her part, Clinton has decided to forgo the standard foreign tour as a candidate because her aides feel she doesn't need to burnish her foreign policy credentials. Instead, she'll take the opportunity afforded in her home state to hobnob with foreign heavyweights -- and try to score political points. Clinton's meeting with Poroshenko, in the eyes of her aides, attempted to highlight the differences between the Democratic and Republican nominee on policy toward Moscow. Clinton's campaign and other Democrats have accused Trump of cozying up to Putin, who has built his foreign policy on thwarting US goals and failing to confront Moscow over its annexation of Crimea in Ukraine. Clinton's adviser said that she believed that Washington needed to do more to stand up to Russian ""aggression"" in Ukraine and to allow the Kiev government to defend itself. Currently, the Obama administration has offered logistical help to Ukraine's armed forces but has fallen short of lethal assistance as some Republicans have championed. The official did not say, however, whether Clinton would move toward lethal aid but said that she would take a look at any requests from the Ukrainians. Clinton's meeting with Sisi will make waves in the Middle East because of the recent estrangement between the Egyptian President's government and the Obama administration. Clinton, according to an aide in the room, ""emphasized the importance of respect for rule of law and human rights to Egypt's future progress"" and ""discussed ways to deepen counterterrorism cooperation, particularly in the fight against ISIS."" Clinton also used the meeting to call for the release of US citizen Aya Hijazi, who has been imprisoned in Egypt since 2014 after operating a non-profit in the country. Clinton's adviser cautioned that the meeting on Monday did not augur any kind of policy change towards Egypt. But nevertheless, the official said, Clinton does understand the complexity and complications of US relations with Egypt, a nation that is pivotal to the balance of power in the Middle East, is facing its own terror threats and would be critical to any renewed effort at Israeli-Palestinian peace. Sisi assumed power following a coup against the elected Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt in 2013. Clinton had been secretary of state when the US helped push Egypt's longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak from power after a popular uprising, but was seen as less pro-active than other members of Obama's cabinet in cutting loose a crucial, long-standing US ally. ""There are a lot of things that the Sisi government is doing that are concerning,"" the official said. Trump's positions on foreign policy, among them on Egypt, are more opaque than those of Clinton. But in his terrorism speech in August, he vowed to work with leaders in the Middle East -- including Sisi -- who ""recognize that this ideology of death"" must be extinguished. Clinton's meeting with Abe comes at a time of increased tensions in Asia following North Korea's latest nuclear weapons test. The meeting will likely highlight Clinton's commitment to US alliances in Japan and South Korea and the US belief that it is up to China to do more to convince its ally in Pyongyang to turn away from its nuclear path. Clinton, according to an aide, discussed ""the threat from North Korea"" and ""relations with China"" during the meeting. And Abe brought up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive 12-country trade deal that the Japanese prime minister has backed and Clinton has rejected. There is significant concern among US allies the region about the prospect of a Trump presidency -- not least because the GOP nominee has warned that both nations must pay more to keep US forces in their countries and raised the possibility that Pyongyang's growing threat could force both states to develop their own nuclear weapons, a step neither nation wants to take.",0.032598274,0.004793864,0.004793864,0.009587728,0.054650048,0.334611697,0.008628955,2,-1,1
"The season premiere of the hit television drama Empire features an amazing song performed by Jussie Smollett, who plays Jamal on the show. The song, entitled ?Need Freedom? has a very clear message: gun violence, senseless killings, and police brutality against people of color must stop, because our nation is ripping itself apart. Smollett says of the decisions that inspired him to record ?Need Freedom?: ?I recorded this exactly seven days after Philando Castile was shot. Between the shootings of Castile, Alton Sterling, at the Pulse in Orlando and the police officers in Dallas ? not to mention the other numerous killings over the last couple of years ? it was like wecouldn breathe. What are we doing as a people, a nation; what messages are we sending to the next generation. Then this song came.? Smollet is right, of course, and what better way to inspire people in an effort to draw peace in such a tense and violent time, where there is such anger, such division, such justified outrage, than by doing so in song? Here are just a few of the more inspiring lyrics fromSmollet song: As I sit and think about Allthat goin? on My soul just cries out Can you tell me please? Tell mewho to blame For causing all this pain Theone we call to help us turn They kills us everyday See war is not the answer And love is what we need Take the chains off, break the bondage Set my people free We gotta make it betterSomething gotta change The world needs your voice just to make it through the rain When I think ofwhat goin? on in this world Ohh it gets me to see my sister not breathe My sister, my brother here with me Need freedom Our world is cryin?, no more silence, with guns and violence Need freedom Ican keep dyin?,we way too quiet, no more silence Need freedom Stop this evil, free my people,we all equal Need freedom Our worldget brighter, keep on tryin?, keep on fightin? for freedom These lyrics come on this night, September 21, as, at this very moment, protests are erupting in Charlotte, North Carolina, because yet another black man, Keith Lamont Scott, is dead at the hands of the police. Already, as per usual, the police are in front of cameras, in damage control mode, spinning the story they want the public to hear. Whether it is true matters not to them; they only want to cover their own asses, because black lives simplydon matter to them. This message is one that is definitely needed. It is, of course, a message that will likely fall on deaf ears. We live in a nation where people think that the right of every person to have as many guns as they like, anytime they like, no matter what, should supercede the rights of innocent people to live. These are the same people who think that cops can do no wrong, and that the bloodshed at their hands is always justified. These are same people who believe that freedom only applies to certain people, and to hell with everyone else.They the people who think that every black man shot by police was just another thuganyway, and that the void left in the lives of his loved ones is of no importance.They the same people whodon care about what happened in Orlando, or Oregon, or Newtown, or any of the other countless places where people who should have never had firearms carried out massacres. They only care about their guns and their rigid belief that whatever happened was worth their version of ?freedom.? Hopefully, the people who need to hear this message the most will, and the killing will stop. However, I sadlywon be able to hold my breath on that one. It will only continue another day, in another city after another innocent life is lost, or another unbelievably tragic and preventable massacre is carried out.

"Story highlights Ryan called for calm in Charlotte, but would not comment on Trump's ""stop and frisk"" proposals Earlier this week Ryan said he wanted Congress to complete work on a criminal justice reform bill Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan ducked Thursday on whether he supports the ""stop and frisk"" policy pushed by Donald Trump. ""I don't have an answer for you because it's not something that I've familiarized myself with -- the constitutionality of it, its efficacy, whether (it) worked well in New York City or not,"" Ryan said after being pressed twice by reporters on the policy the GOP nominee wants to revive, despite court rulings finding it unconstitutional. Ryan called for calm following the shooting in Charlotte, saying about the unrest in the city overnight, ""these images are just so heartbreaking and they are upsetting."" ""The loss of any life is a tragedy. The response to that though cannot be more violence. As leaders, it is responsibility to promote calm, peace and dialogue.

Clinton attorney David Kendall sent a letter to House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) saying that the panel's subpoena to Florida-based computer security company SECNAP went too far by demanding details on safeguards in place after Clinton emails from her time as secretary state were removed from the server in 2014. ""The subpoena ... is overbroad,"" Kendall wrote in the letter, obtained by POLITICO. ""We have no objection to the production of documents related to the SECNAP security device used in connection with the server that ... hosted Secretary Clinton's emails from her tenure as secretary .... We do object, however, to the production of SECNAP documents and security information regarding security equipment that was used by CESC after the prior server was provided to the FBI, and thus, never hosted Secretary Clinton's work-related emails."" ""Documents regarding this equipment are likely to contain sensitive information related to security of the current network and/or server,"" Kendall added. ""Because these documents are unrelated to the Committee's investigation and contain sensitive security information, I respectfully object to the portion of the subpoena seeking their production."" A spokeswoman for Smith did not immediately respond to a request Friday night seeking comment on Kendall's letter. Smith has been pressing for records from the FBI and private firms as part of his panel's investigation into the security vulnerabilities of the private system Clinton used to store the tens of thousands of emails she exchanged while secretary. Other House and Senate committee are conducting similar inquiries. When the House Oversight Committee called in computer technicians from the Clintons' main computer contractor Platte River Networks last week, Smith was granted special permission to sit on the dais. He said his panel was being denied information because of resistance from Clinton and her attorneys. ""SECNAP counsel confirmed to my staff that the Clinton's private LLC is actively engaged in directing their obstructionist responses to congressional subpoenas. This is a clear obstruction of justice. Americans deserve to know the truth, which is now being blocked by the Clinton organization,"" Smith said. A former Clinton aide, Justin Cooper, did testify at that hearing, but the questioning of the computer technicians was to no avail since both exercised their Fifth Amendment rights. Asked about Kendall's response to the Science Committee subpoena, a spokeswoman for the panel's ranking Democrat Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas had no specific comment, However, the spokeswoman pointed to an earlier statement sharply criticizing the chairman's email-related probe and questioning the panel's jurisdiction over the issue. ?I am outraged that the Chairman is recklessly abusing theCommittee investigatory powers to brazenly do the bidding of the Trump campaign. I am certain that the Science Committee will not uncover any ?smoking gun? after this issue has already been thoroughly investigated by the Benghazi Committee at a cost of $7 million in taxpayer dollars as well as by the FBI,"" Johnson said.

"At a Florida rally Monday night, Donald Trump twice repeated the false claim that he opposed the Iraq War before it started. ""I was against going into the war in Iraq, he told the crowd, ""but we got out the wrong way. President Obama did a terrible thing the way he got us out of the war."" But CNN's research shows no evidence for his repeated claim of opposition to the war before it started. Instead, during a September 2002 interview on Howard Stern's radio show Trump was asked if he supported invading Iraq. ""Yeah, I guess so,"" he answered. Hardly a ringing endorsement of the upcoming war. But nowhere near full-throated opposition. In an August speech, Trump pointed to an interview with Fox News Channel anchor Neil Cavuto, three months before the war started, to bolster his case that he opposed the war. At one point in the interview, he expressed impatience with President George W. Bush for not starting the war. ""Well, I'm starting to think that people are much more focused now on the economy,"" he said. ""They are getting a little bit tired of hearing, we're going in, we're not going in, the -- you know, whatever happened to the days of the Douglas MacArthur. He would go and attack. He wouldn't talk. We have to -- you know, it's sort like either do it or don't do it."" JUST WATCHED Donald Trump in 2002: I support Iraq invasion Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Donald Trump in 2002: I support Iraq invasion 01:32 Later in the interview, Trump said the war was not a higher priority than the economy. But he never said it should not be undertaken.

I think the Iraq situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned."" It wasn't until August 2004 -- 17 months after the invasion began and the war was being widely criticized -- that Trump came out fully against the war. ""What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed,"" he said in an interview with Esquire magazine. ""And what about the people coming back with no arms and legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!"" This gap between what Trump claims and the evidence to the contrary has been pointed out many times. Yet he keeps repeating the claims.

"Nate Smith, executive director of the Texas Nationalist Movement, looked uncertain as a man identifying himself as an east Ukrainian resistance fighter pledged solidarity toSmith struggle for an independent Texas. Standing in a conference room in the Ritz Hotel in central Moscow on Sunday, Smith nodded noncommittally and handed over his business card. Itwasn the only incongruous encounter taking place at the Ritz at what has been dubbedMoscow international conference of separatists, an eclectic Kremlin-funded gathering of organizations and sometimes wacky individuals pressing for self-rule for often unlikely territories. Amidst the heavy glitz of the hotel, Catalonian separatists and dissident Irish republicans listened politely to presentations from east Ukrainian rebels, Azerbaijani minorities and the thoughts of the self-proclaimed ""King of Hawaii,"" who called in via video link. And among the few dozen activists comparing ideas for how to achieve self-determination, were two Americans campaigning for Texan and Californian secession from the United States. The conference, now in its second year, is funded largely by the Kremlin and organized by the Anti-Globalization Movement of Russia, a group that closely follows government positions. The movement says it is unconnected to the Kremlin, but the hotel conference was almost entirely paid for by a charitable fund founded by President Vladimir Putin, which provided close to $546,000 for the project, according to public records. The attendees, including the Texan delegate, had been offered free flights and accommodation. Theconference organizers present it as a platform for marginalized groups, but its agenda overlaps with Kremlin efforts to promote Russia as an alternative guardian for global order, at the head of democratic movement opposed to alleged American imperialism. ?Our main goal is to create a multi-polar world,? theconference creator, Aleksander V. Ionov, told its participants. ?Our president, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, is probably the main anti-globalist in the world.? Ionov himself, a relatively little-known businessman, has repeatedly met Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom Russia is backing militarily, saying the two discussed humanitarian aid and media activities two weeks ago.Ionov conference plays intoMoscow own long-time policy of backing separatists in its former Soviet neighbors. While jailing and harassing separatist groups at home, Moscow has leveraged them abroad a pretext for military intervention, most recently fomenting the violent secessionist conflict in eastern Ukraine. A sizable presence of pro-Russian rebel supporters was visible on Sunday, while not a single Russian separatist group took part. All that and the anti-American flavor sometimes made uncomfortable listening for the groups less used to the atmosphere in theKremlin orbit. ?It?s kind of awkward I guess,? Smith said after one 30-minute denunciation of American inequity. ABC NewsSmith group, the Texas Nationalist Movement, is campaigning for a referendum on whether Texas should exit the United States. Founded over 10 years ago, the group attracted some attention recently when it came within two votes of forcing the Texas state GOP to bring a debate on a secession referendum to the floor of the Republican convention. Smith said he was grateful for the chance to promote his campaign and was eager to clarify his attendance did not mean he was aligning with the Kremlin. ?We?re here to have a dialogue.We not in agreement with all the groups that are here,? Smith said. ?We?re here for very specific reasons. We came here to make a statement on behalf of the people of Texas.? It was a sentiment echoed by Louis J. Marinelli from the YES California Independence Campaign, there to get his message out about his plan to make the Golden State a nation. ?We want to draw attention to our campaign,? Marinelli said. ?We?re not signing an alliance with Russia or anything like that."" The two secessionists? urge for independence stems largely from a distaste with American foreign policy and a sense the U.S. has become dysfunctional. A gentle-mannered IT consultant married to a Russian, Marinelli is aiming for a secession referendum by 2019. ?The U.S. government is so dysfunctional itcan be repaired from within anymore, and if we were a separate nation running our own affairs, we could improve the quality of life for Californians,? Marinelli said. Both men were hoping for a Donald Trump victory in the U.S. presidential elections, banking on a surge in people looking to detach themselves from America. The U.K.'s recent ""Brexit"" vote to leave the European Union had also heartened many attendees. But why exactly the Kremlin had decided to pay to gather them in Moscow, few among the foreign attendees could say. Nor did they appear particularly interested. ?I?m not here to make presumptions about potential reasons for this conference,? Smith said. However, the conference -- and its location in one ofMoscow expensive hotels, within shouting distance of the Kremlin walls -- slots into a recognizable recent Russian strategy. Russia has been backing far right political parties in the West, in particular, reportedly fundingFrance anti-European Union party, the Front National, with a $10 million loan. The practice echoes that of the Soviet Union, which secretly supported radical fringe groups around the world, but now coupled with elaborate disinformation campaigns from state media outlets. ?It?s a school-book case,? said Peter Kreko, a Fulbright visiting professor at Indiana University who has studiedRussia use of the far right. ?The simple reason is that Russia is interested in dividing the Western world. The strategy is not to create new divisions but to take the most from divisions already there.? Kreko said the idea was to back groups hindering European integration and to undermine faith in Western-style liberal democracy. ?The tool-kit is pretty much the same as in the Soviet Union. Any kind of movements that can cause chaos,? Kreko said, adding he thought the conference was also a prop for domestic propaganda that state media would use to paint Russia as a champion of democracy. Few of the conference attendees were concerned they might become Kremlin pawns, seeing it simply as a way to get their message out. ?Everybody?s using everybody,? Marinelli said. ?We?re using this conference for our own purposes. We want the attention so that we can get the word out, they want ..."" he trailed off before finishing. ?Everybody?s got their own agenda, right? So,that just the way it is.? For most of the attendees the main pull appeared to be the guaranteed presence of the media, attracted by theconference oddity. ?I?ve talked to seven media [organizations] today. I've got to get my story out,? said Diarmuid Mac Dubhglais, international secretary for Republican SinnF, a tiny Irish republican splinter group that supports the violent removal of British control over Northern Ireland. In any case, Mac Dubhglais said, hewouldn let ?Vladimir himself? impose ideas on him. ?I?m not going to start passing out propaganda when I go home and start marching Soviet-style,"" he said. Besides, he said, perhaps the Russian motive was altruistic. ?Maybe in fairness, they might think the cause is just,? he said then paused, before adding: ?I?m hopingthat what they think.""",0.037209302,0.001162791,0.006976744,0.013953488,0.053488372,0.273255814,0.006976744,2,-1,1
"An Ohio judge ordered an attorney jailed for five days after she refused to remove a Black Lives Matter pin she wore to court. The lawyer is appealing the case. Attorney Andrea Burton of Youngstown, Ohio, was charged with contempt of court and given a five-day jail sentence on July 22 after she refused to take off the pin at Judge Robert Milich's request, the New York Daily News reported. The judge reportedly called Burton, who was representing a client at the time, into his chambers and spoke privately to her about the matter. When the lawyer continued to wear the pin, he adjourned the proceedings and ordered her to be held on a contempt charge. Milich told WKBN he made his ruling based on Supreme Court precedent that allows judges to prohibit political expression in courtrooms. ?There?s a difference between a flag, a pin from your church or the Eagles and having a pinthat on a political issue,? Milich said. The judge claimed his decision was not influenced by his own personal views. ""A judge doesn't support either side,"" he told WKBN. ""A judge is objective and tries to make sure everyone has an opportunity to have a fair hearing, and it was a situation where it was just in violation of the law."" Burton has been released pending an appeal on the condition that she refrain from wearing any items that make a political statement in court. If she loses the appeal, she will have to serve five days in jail. The attorney told New York Daily News that her constitutional right to free speech superseded Supreme Court case law and the judge's discretion. ?It's an act of civil disobedience, I understand that,"" Burton told NY Daily News. ""I?m not anti-police, I work with law enforcement and I hold them in the highest regard, and just to say for the record I do believe all lives matter. But at this point theydon all matter equally, andthat the problem in the justice system."" Mike Brickner, the senior policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, said that judges are generally given a wide latitude in what they allow or don't allow in the courtroom, although their decisions must be reasonable and fairly applied. ""There have been cases in the past when people have been given contempt of court for refusing to comply with a judge's order to remove an article of clothing that may have a message on it,"" Brickner wrote in a July 22 email to WKBN. ""Many times this has been done to retain thedefendant right to a fair trial.""",0.02739726,0.0,0.01369863,0.006849315,0.068493151,0.325342466,0.0034246579999999997,2,-1,1
"Sen. Ted Cruz had decided not to endorse Donald Trump during the Republican National Convention in July. | Getty Cruz: I'm voting for Trump 'Last year, I promised to support the Republican nominee. And I intend to keep my word,' Cruz wrote. Ted Cruz on Friday said he would vote for Donald Trump for president and that he would encourage others to do the same, reversing months of opposition to his bitter primary rival. ""After many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump,"" he wrote in a Facebook post. Story Continued Below Cruz said he endorsed both because of his primary pledge to support the party nominee, as well as his concerns about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. ""Last year, I promised to support the Republican nominee. And I intend to keep my word,"" Cruz said. ""Second, even though I have had areas of significant disagreement with our nominee, by any measure Hillary Clinton is wholly unacceptable ?that why I have always been #NeverHillary."" A Trump adviser said Trump and Cruz spoke after the endorsement. For months, Cruz had avoided endorsing Trump, his primary foe in an intensely personal race. People close to him were sharply divided on Friday over the decision, hours before he made his endorsement. ?If he announces he endorses, it destroys his political brand,? said someone who had worked for Cruz's campaign. Steve Deace, a prominent conservative Iowa radio host who was a major Cruz backer, also tweeted Friday that the senator would endorse Trump. A spokeswoman for Cruz did not respond to multiple requests for comment. ""This is gonna be a political disaster,"" Deace texted after Cruz made his decision official. ""Sad. Unavoidable. Entirely self inflicted."" Trump responded in a statement that he was ""greatly honored"" by the nod. ""We have fought the battle and he was a tough and brilliant opponent,"" Trump said. ""I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again."" Cruz had previously gone as far as to tell Republicans to ?vote your conscience? at the Republican National Convention, rather than urging them to get behind the nominee. Since then, Cruz, who may face a primary challenge in his 2018 Senate reelection campaign, has come under mounting pressure to get behind Trump, though many Cruz loyalists see an endorsement as unacceptable. At the outset of the Republican primary, Cruz went out of his way to praise Trump, expecting that the real estatemogul support would crumble, and Cruz would be the beneficiary. But as the primary continued and Trump moved into an increasingly strong position in the race, Cruz sought to fashion himself as the conservative alternative to Trump, repeatedly describing his opponent as a liberal who had few differences with Hillary Clinton. The race turned increasingly personal between the two, with Trump attackingCruz wife and seeking to linkCruz father to conspiracy theories about assassinating former President John F. Kennedy. On the day that he dropped out of the race, Cruz took his criticism of Trump to a new level, accusing him of being a ?pathological liar,? a ?serial philanderer? and an ?utterly amoral? ?bully.? The personal differences between the two of them, as well asTrump willingness to flaunt conservative orthodoxy that many Cruz loyalists embrace, has made supporting the nominee a nonstarter for many of thesenator most committed backers. But slowly, other conservative leaders, including many who backed Cruz in the primary, have gotten on board with Trump, and have made clear publicly that Cruz should do the same. They view the election as a binary election between Hillary Clinton and Trump, rather than accepting the more nuanced stance that Cruz took at the convention. ?I think he should give a nod of support,? said Tony Perkins, the head of the Family Research Council, who was previously an important Cruz backer. ?I think a lot of folks that supported Ted feel that way. Given the choices before us, yeah, I would like to see Ted give his support to Trump at this point.? The initial calculation at the RNC from many who backedCruz decision was that, assuming Trump went up in flames in November, Cruz would emerge from the election respected as one of the last principled conservatives, willing to serve as the final bulwark against a candidate who violated many of the values conservatives hold dear. Supporting Trump would tieCruz fortunes more closely to his, a possible complication for Cruz, whose fans have long wanted him to look at running for president again in 2020. But there is a more urgent need to attend to:Cruz unwillingness to support Trump has become an issue in his home state as he prepares for Senate re-election. The morning after he refused to support Trump at the RNC, the Texas delegation breakfast broke out into chaos as delegates split over whether or not Cruz should support the nominee. Since then, Rep. Mike McCaul (R-Texas), a possible Cruz primary challenger forCruz Senate seat, has been using thesenator unwillingness to support Trump as a means of attacking Cruz. McCaul attacked Cruz on the Laura Ingraham Show this week for breaking his pledge to support the nominee, declaring he was ?very angry? about the dissension. ?He broke his word,? said McCaul, the wealthy chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. The Texas senator has been gradually making moves to soothe his often poor relations with fellow senators since his primary loss, helping raise money for at-risk Republicans and donating $100,000 to the SenateGOP campaign arm. But many Republicans on Capitol Hill have prodded him to go further and hold his nose with an endorsement. While several Republicans saidCruz bloc of conservative voters could make the difference for Trump, others said any endorsement would be more about helping secureCruz own political standing thanTrump. ?Idon think endorsements matter,? said one Republican senator. Agreed Perkins, ?At this point, I thinkit probably more beneficial to Ted than it is to Trump, to show that Ted is a team player. And look,there a lot of folks, like myself, [for whom] Donald Trump was not our first choice. But he is working hard to gain the support and confidence of conservatives, and the alternative is clear.? Of people close to Cruz who disagree with any indication of support for Trump, some say that voting for Trump ? but attempting to distinguish between a vote and an endorsement, as senators such as Kelly Ayotte have done ? might be forgivable. But a full-on endorsement, especially one that would entail campaigning for the Republican nominee, would be harder to stomach.Cruz move toward his former rival takes away the most prominent anti-Trump holdout in Congress, leaving Sens. Jeff Flake of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Mike Lee of Utah as the remaining senators who either oppose orhaven supported Trump. Few have shown any inclination to followCruz lead. ?I?m against Hillary Clinton for president,that where I am,? Heller said Thursday. ?We?ll go through the debate and see how it plays out.? Lee,Cruz strongest defender and closest friend in the Senate, indicated he has no plans to followCruz lead. In a statement, Lee said he is watching ?each candidate's grasp of ? and willingness to work tirelessly to restore ? federalism and separation of powers. ?I am always eager to support any candidate willing to make those structural constitutional protections a priority. In this race and in every other, I will continue to use the same criteria,? Lee said. But Trump has made some overtures to Lee, on Friday including him on a list of his potential choices for a Supreme Court nomination. Lee was not interested. Asked about a possible endorsement of Trump, Jason Johnson,Cruz chief strategist on the campaign, responded with what appeared to be a photo of himself, with his hand over his face.

Pagliano was the IT staffer who set up Clinton's private email server during her time as secretary of state. On Sept. 13, Pagliano did not show up to testify before the committee despite being subpoenaed. After his chair was vacant again at today's hearing, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah and chairman of the committee, held a vote to hold Pagliano in contempt of Congress for his refusal to comply with a subpoena issued by the committee. The vote passed 19 to 15, split along party lines. The resolution will now travel to the House floor. Chaffetz argued that Pagliano is a key witness in the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server to conduct government business. The chairman asserted that Pagliano had no reason not to appear before the committee because he would not be subject to criminal liability due to immunity granted by the Department of Justice. But Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, vigorously defendedPagliano decision not to show up, saying that the committee had harassed him by sending U.S. marshals to his workplace with the subpoena. ?I simply cannot vote for a resolution that is potentially so unethical,? Cummings said. Cummings has continuously charged that the hearings related to Clinton's email server are political in nature. Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Massachusetts, feared that the committee was trying to embarrass Pagliano. ""The chairman is saying that his rule is that the witness has to come before the Committee and be subjected to what the witnesses were subjected to last week,"" Lynch said, later adding, ""We?re continuing to try to embarrass this particular witness.?Pagliano lawyer, Mark MacDougall, has said that if his client were brought before the committee, he would plead the Fifth Amendment. Pagliano previously pleaded the Fifth Amendment in September 2015 when he was called before the congressional committee investigating the attack in Benghazi, Libya, that resulted in the deaths of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. Contempt of Congress is defined in statute 2 U.S.C.A. ? 192 and is punishable by a maximum $1,000 fine and up to 12 months of imprisonment. In 2014, the House voted to find former Internal Revenue Service official Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress and adopted a resolution calling on Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a special counsel to investigate the IRS targeting scandal.

"The suspect in a spate of bombings that terrorized the New York City metropolitan area this weekend visited a city in Pakistan known for being a hotbed of insurgent activity, a source told ABC News. Interested in New York? Add New York as an interest to stay up to date on the latest New York news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest The suspect, Ahmad Khan Rahami, was born in 1988 in Afghanistan and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, according to the FBI. Rahami spent time in Quetta, Pakistan, and Afghanistan during a trip, from April 2013 to March 2014, the source said. Quetta, a city of about 2 million people, is a known hotspot for insurgents and the reported home of the leadership of the Afghan Taliban. ""If they spent more than a few days, it raises suspicions that while they were there, they will have been recruited by terrorist groups,"" national security consultant Richard Clarke said on ABC News' ""World News Tonight"" Monday, referring to Rahami's travel to the area. A spokesman for the Taliban, Zabiullah Mujahid, told ABC News that there was no link between the Taliban and Rahami. Matthew McDermott/Polaris Afghan and U.S. government officials say they believe Quetta has sheltered the Afghan Taliban's leaders since the U.S. invasion forced them to flee the country in 2002. The Taliban's central leadership council, believed to be based there, is known as the Quetta Shura. Officials say leaders there have planned and directed attacks across the border in Afghanistan and coordinated with terrorist groups like al-Qaeda. The area has a major border crossing that leads to Kandahar in Afghanistan and is reported to be a transit point for extremists traveling in and out of Afghanistan and a hub for illegal trade crossing the porous and largely unsecured border. WABC Several al-Qaeda militants have been killed or captured in the area, and the United States last year destroyed an al-Qaeda base across the border in Kandahar province that U.S. officials said was the largest militant training camp discovered in the history of the Afghanistan war. Quetta harbors a long-simmering insurgency against the Pakistani government. The city has seen a number of significant violent attacks and bombings, most recently last month, when a blast killed more than 70 people and injured over 100 others. In May of this year, a U.S. airstrike in Baluchistan province, which encompasses Quetta, killed Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour. The Pentagon said in a 2014 report that as long as Afghan Taliban forces enjoy sanctuaryin Quetta and in neighboring border areas of western Pakistan, the Afghan insurgency will persist. Rahami, who was captured Monday after a shootout with police, is being held on charges of attempted murder of a law enforcement officer, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose.",0.035820896,0.011940299,0.002985075,0.008955224,0.056716418,0.28358209,0.017910448,2,-1,1
"Trent Lott e-mailed Senate legislative directors on Monday warning that the bill could lead other countries to withdraw their assets from the U.S. | Getty Saudi lobbyists plot new push against 9/11 bill With a veto override looming, the Saudis are leaning on U.S. companies to pressure Congress to kill the measure. Saudi Arabia is mounting a last-ditch campaign to scuttle legislation allowing families of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to sue the kingdom ? and they're enlisting major American companies to make an economic case against the bill. General Electric, Dow Chemical, Boeing and Chevron are among the corporate titans that have weighed in against the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, which passed both chambers unanimously and was vetoed on Friday, according to people familiar with the effort. The companies are acting quietly to avoid the perception of opposing victims of terrorism, but they're responding to Saudi arguments that their own corporate assets in the kingdom could be at risk if the law takes effect. Story Continued Below Meanwhile, Trent Lott, the former Senate majority leader who now co-leads Squire Patton Boggs' lobbying group, e-mailed Senate legislative directors on Monday warning that the bill could lead other countries to withdraw their assets from the United States and retaliate with laws allowing claims against American government actions. ""Many foreign entities have long-standing, intimate relations with U.S. financial institutions that they would undoubtedly unwind, to the further detriment of the U.S. economy,"" reads one of the attachments, obtained by POLITICO. ""American corporations with interests abroad may be at risk of retaliation, a possibility recently expressed by GE and Dow."" Still, the Saudis and their agents face a significant uphill battle, with lawmakers loath to take a vote against victims of the 9/11 attacks right before an election. There was little public opposition to the bill as it made its way through the Capitol, and even now, efforts to tweak the bill haven't caught much traction. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced Monday that the Senate will vote Wednesday on a motion to override President Barack Obama's veto, and if override advocates are successful there, the House will take the same vote Thursday or Friday, a House Republican leadership aide said. But even if Obama receives the first veto override of his presidency, the story won't end there: the Saudis will seek a new bill to scale back the law in the lame-duck session or in the next session, after lawmakers are relieved from the heat of the campaign, people familiar with the plans said. ""It's Washington at its finest,"" one of the people said. While the White House has emphasized national security to justify rejecting the bill, enlisting business interests could prove influential with lawmakers representing places where the companies have significant economic footprints. Companies could lose favored access to the Saudi market and see their own assets subject to seizure in lawsuits, just as Saudi holdings in the U.S. would be, people familiar with the situation said. ""While I understand that the sponsors are well-intentioned, the bill potentially could have serious consequences for our country's critical relationships in the Middle East and with the rest of the world,"" GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt wrote in a Sept. 22 letter to McConnell obtained by POLITICO. ""The bill is not balanced, sets a dangerous precedent, and has real potential to destabilize bilateral relationships and the global economy."" In May GE committed to investing $3 billion in Saudi water, energy, aviation and digital projects, part of the country's push to diversify its economy from oil. One source familiar with Boeing's effort said the company wrote in the letter that the victims? families deserve justice but argued that the economic consequences of the bill were important to consider. The letter warned of potential job losses, the source said. Dow Chemical is also lobbying against the bill, people familiar with the campaign said. Dow has several facilities in Saudi Arabia and Boeing this year sent its first 787 jet to Saudi Arabian Airlines. Chevron, which has an oil field and chemical plants in the kingdom, reported lobbying on the bill last quarter, disclosure show. Several financial firms are also monitoring the legislation but not taking a stand on it. The Saudis are now spending more than $250,000 a month fighting the bill, retaining powerhouses Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, Glover Park Group, Sphere Consulting and Squire Patton Boggs. Besides working with companies invested in Saudi Arabia, the lobbyists are directly contacting lawmakers, placing opinion articles and seeking support from think tank scholars. GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bob Corker of Tennessee are trying to hammer out a compromise that would soften the bill, bringing it in line with previously proposed versions rather than keeping the harsher language that just passed. A proposed amendment obtained by POLITICO ? an effort that one person said was led primarily by Graham ? suggests restoring an exemption for discretionary government actions, which the document says would prevent American interference in foreign countries' internal policies and vice versa. A Graham spokesman declined to comment on the language. Graham, who had voiced concerns about the legislation, said in an interview last week that discussions to address those issues were ""not at the level I would appreciate."" ""We'll see,"" Graham said then. ""Time will tell."" GE declined to comment beyond Immelt's letter. Dow, Boeing, Chevron and the Saudi embassy didn't answer requests for comment.

Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) September 19, 2016 Despite widespread condemnation, the campaign stood by the tweet and in a statement called Trump Jr. ""a tremendous asset to the campaign."" ""America has become less safe under Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and Clinton's planned 550% increase in Syrian refugees is a dangerous proposal that will put American lives at risk,"" said senior communication adviser Jason Miller. ""Speaking the truth might upset those who would rather be politically correct than safe, but the American people want a change, and only Donald Trump will do what's needed to protect us."" Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, also defended the comparison to CNN's Erin Burnett. ""What we do know is that many Americans are concerned with the lack of vetting that's going on. We see what's happening all across Europe ... that has been a disaster,"" she said Tuesday on ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" But Mars Candy, which produces Skittles, said in a statement, ""Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don't feel it's an appropriate analogy. We respectfully refrain from further commentary as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing."" 'This is disgusting' The graphic's language apparently wasn't a Trump Jr. original, but instead that of former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois and now a conservative talk radio host. Walsh tweeted at Trump Jr.: ""Hey @DonaldTrumpJr, that's the point I made last month. Glad you agree.""

Hillary Clinton's campaign spokesman Nick Merrill retweeted Trump Jr. adding: ""This is disgusting."" The 2016 campaign has featured heated rhetoric around US policy for accepting refugees. Clinton has called for an increase in the number of Syrian refugees the US should accept and Trump has called for ""extreme vetting"" of immigrants, as well as a ban on immigrants from countries that are hotbeds of terrorism, such as Syria. One of President Barack Obama's former speechwriters responded to Trump Jr. with a link to CNN reporting about a little boy in Aleppo, Syria, who became the face of the humanitarian crises in Syria.

Last week, Trump Jr. was criticized for making a ""gas chamber"" reference when complaining about how the treatment his father has received form the media compared to the coverage from Clinton.

" As Hillary Clinton on Monday night reeled off a litany of insults he had leveled against women through the years, including some nasty nicknames for a former Miss Universe, Donald Trump leaned into his microphone and asked repeatedly, ""Where did you find this? Where did you find this?"" The Clinton campaign need not have looked far, or particularly hard, to turn up instances of the Republican presidential nominee speaking in cold or cruel ways about women. Trump has made a habit of it over the years, targeting public figures, even his own wives and girlfriends. ""She was the winner (of the pageant), and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem,"" Trump said. ""We had a real problem."" The Trump campaign has pushed back against suggestions his past comments betrayed any lack of respect for women. ""Mr. Trump has tremendous relationships with women,"" spokeswoman Hope Hicks told CNN in an email, noting the presence of high-ranking female officials within his campaign and company. ""To say otherwise is wholly inaccurate and based on unsubstantiated claims from publicity hungry individuals."" But many of Trump's nastiest affronts are matters of public record. And voters have noticed -- even as he gained in recent polls, Clinton's lead among women remained considerable, usually up around 20 points. Here is an incomplete list of his insults over the years: Critical women During the first Republican primary event in August 2015, Fox News' Megyn Kelly challenged him over his past comments about women. Trump didn't like it. ""You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes,"" he told CNN's Don Lemon after the fact. ""Blood coming out of her ... wherever."" His feud with Kelly would stretch on. Before it was informally settled, he would retweet another Twitter user who posted images form Kelly's GQ Magazine photo shoot and called her a ""bimbo."" Trump and Rosie O'Donnell have sparred for years -- right through Monday night. During her time on ABC's ""The View,"" O'Donnell had disparaged Trump as a ""snake-oil salesman"" and discussed his bankruptcy. Trump has been especially harsh in return. In this clip from a 2006 Entertainment Tonight segment, he called O'Donnell a ""slob."" ""If I were running 'The View,' I'd fire Rosie. I'd look her right in that fat ugly face of hers, I'd say, 'Rosie, you're fired,' "" he said, channeling his reality TV tagline. ""We're all a little chubby, Rosie is just a little worse than most of us. But it's not just the chubbiness. Rosie is a very unattractive person, both inside and out."" In August 2012, he mocked Arianna Huffington, whose ex-husband Michael revealed he was gay a year after their marriage ended in 1997, tweeting that she was ""unattractive both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man- he made a good decision."" .@ariannahuff is unattractive both inside and out.

In the space of six minutes on October 28, 2012, he tweeted at the singer and actress twice, first calling her ""grotesque,"" then adding: ""While @BetteMidler is an extremely unattractive woman, I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct.""

During a brief back-and-forth for which she eventually apologized, Trump tweeted : ""Her mind is shot - resign! Crude gender stereotypes In a clip turned up by HBO's John Oliver, Trump discusses with a female reporter how contestants at his beauty pageant are judged. Then comments on her own appearance (at 4:56). There is a pattern. The future GOP nominee offered this assessment in his 1997 book, ""Trump: The Art of the Comeback"": ""Women have one of the great acts of all time,"" he wrote. ""The smart ones act very feminine and needy, but inside they are real killers. The person who came up with the expression 'the weaker sex' was either very naive or had to be kidding. I have seen women manipulate men with just a twitch of their eye -- or perhaps another body part."" When discussing whether he might want more children with his third wife during a 2005 visit to radio host Howard Stern , Trump explained his paternal role as such: ""I mean, I won't do anything to take care of them. I'll supply funds and she'll take care of the kids. It's not like I'm gonna be walking the kids down Central Park."" More recently, as he again considered a run for office, Trump tweeted that the presence of women, simply by their presence in the ranks, were to blame for sexual assault in the military. ""26,000 unreported sexual assaults in the military-only 238 convictions,"" he tweeted in May 2013. ""What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?"" 26,000 unreported sexual assults in the military-only 238 convictions.

Lenny Jacobson (@Lennyjacobson) April 17, 2015 By the fall of 2015, Trump was a leading candidate for the Republican nomination. During an interview with Rolling Stone he commented on his primary rival, Carly Fiorina. This was the scene, as reporter Paul Solotaroff described it in his story : ""When the anchor throws to Carly Fiorina for her reaction to Trump's momentum, Trump's expression sours in schoolboy disgust as the camera bores in on Fiorina. 'Look at that face!' he cries. 'Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!' What he said to the face of ""Celebrity Apprentice"" contestant and former Playboy playmate, Brande Roderick, during a 2013 show left her blank-faced. ""It must be a pretty picture,"" Trump said. ""You dropping to your knees."" Disgust at normal bodily functions At a campaign event in December 2015, he remarked on Clinton's slightly delayed return from a bathroom break during a recent Democratic primary debate. ""I know where she went, it's disgusting, I don't want to talk about it,"" Trump said. ""No, it's too disgusting. Don't say it, it's disgusting, let's not talk, we want to be very, very straight up."" It wasn't the first time Trump had expressed some revulsion at something so mundane. In July 2015, attorney Elizabeth Beck told CNN's Alisyn Camerota that Trump a few years earlier had suffered an ""absolute meltdown"" after she requested a break to pump breast milk. ""He got up,"" Beck said, ""his face got red, he shook his finger at me and he screamed, 'You're disgusting, you're disgusting,' and he ran out of there.""",0.022515527999999996,0.00931677,0.00621118,0.00931677,0.049689440999999994,0.24689441,0.0,2,-1,1
"Washington  Republicans are preparing for the penalty phase of the 2016 election. The next Republican civil war came into greater focus over the weekend when party chairman Reince Priebus threw a thinly veiled warning at former GOP 2016ers who haven't yet endorsed Donald Trump: ""Get on board"" or face penalties if you ever seek the presidency again. The nudge -- aimed at Republicans such as John Kasich, Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush -- was no off-the-cuff expression of frustration. Several Republican party chairs in early voting states told CNN that Priebus has spent days talking about enforcing the pledge that all 17 GOP candidates signed at the outset of the 2016 primary to support the eventual nominee.

""If I'm hearing it here from a state of 3 million, it must a megaphone there in DC,"" said Kaufmann, who has spoken with Priebus and other Republican officials about enforcing the pledge. ""There's no wiggle room in terms of what that promise was, and it should be honored."" A representative for Priebus didn't comment on the conversations. But his call for penalties wasn't widely embraced -- with the No. 2 House Republican breaking with Priebus Tuesday morning. ""There's a better way to unite people. I'm not a big believer that punishment unites people,"" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters at a weekly session in the Capitol. The California Republican added, ""If Hillary (Clinton) can't unite Republicans, I don't think anything can."" Premature conversation? Of course, talk of penalties on candidates who might run in 2020 could be all for naught if Trump wins. The race between Trump and Clinton has narrowed dramatically in recent weeks, though the Democratic nominee still has more paths to the White House. But the episode underscores the frenzy that could consume the GOP if Trump loses the race and the party searches for a new direction. ""We're watching the trailer for the GOP civil war, out in theaters November 9,"" said a top Republican strategist, who asked not to be named to avoid openly feuding with Priebus. The penalty talk spilled into the open Sunday, when Priebus told John Dickerson on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that members of the 2016 Republican presidential field who haven't yet abided by their pledge to back the eventual nominee and endorsed Trump need to ""get on board."" And for those who don't, he said future presidential bids won't ""be that easy."" ""If a private entity puts forward a process and has agreement with the participants in that process, and those participants don't follow through with the promises that they made in that process,"" Priebus said, ""what should a private party do about that if those same people come around in four or eight years?"" Kasich's camp quickly zipped off a response accusing Priebus of putting party over principles.

""These are serious times. I think the last thing we need to worrying about is bickering between Republicans,"" he said. ""My focus is on defeating Hillary Clinton and helping preserve a Senate Republican majority."" The RNC's leverage Penalties, several Republicans said, would likely come from the national party in the form of restrictions on access to the Republican National Committee's data and voter files -- and potentially bans from primary debates. Individual states, though, likely couldn't keep candidates off their ballots. Still, Republicans cautioned that talk of penalizing pledge-breakers is aimed at nudging Kasich, Cruz, Bush and others to support Trump in 2016 -- not to handicap the party's presidential candidates in the future. Some said it's not even clear the RNC would have authority to impose the crackdown Priebus discussed. ""Reince has simply posed a question to which there is no good answer yet -- and I'm not sure that the question deserves an answer. That's to be determined,"" said Matt Moore, the South Carolina GOP chairman. RNC spokeswoman Lindsay Walters declined to address the possibility of penalizing future presidential candidates who didn't abide by their pledges to support Trump. ""We are focused on winning back the White House and maintaining our majorities in the House and Senate,"" Walters said in an email. While some party honchos like Kaufmann backed Priebus' warning shot, others -- including Ohio GOP chairman Matt Borges -- bristled. ""No. This is not what we are all about as a party. Besides, let's stay focused on 2016 for the next 50 days,"" Borges tweeted Sunday night. Top Mitt Romney 2012 strategist Stuart Stevens tweeted: ""So idea is most popular recent Republican governors of battleground states should run as independents? Great plan."" RNC's handling of Trump The RNC's handling of Trump under Priebus will be on trial as the party picks a new chair -- or extends the Wisconsin operative's tenure -- shortly after the election. Then comes a swing-state governor's race in Virginia, followed by the midterm elections, where Trump's brand of populism could butt against more orthodox conservatives. And in 2020, the early stages of the Republican primary would be defined by how the candidates treated Trump. It would be the clearest differentiator of like-minded conservatives like Mike Pence, the Indiana governor who became Trump's running mate and chief defender, and Cruz, the Texas senator who was booed off stage for refusing to endorse Trump at his own nominating convention. ""Assuming Trump loses, there'll be a really pitched battle for the heart and soul of the party,"" said Weaver, the Kasich strategist who wrote the scathing rebuttal to Priebus on Sunday. ""You're going to have off-year elections, you're going to have midterms -- some of that will impact the defining of the party, clearly. But you won't have any new definition of it until there's a new nominee,"" Weaver said. ""There's a broader debate ultimately about what the party stands for and where the country should go."" Many Republicans still fault Priebus for failing to criticize Trump forcefully enough in late 2015, when he proposed a clearly unconstitutional ban of all Muslims from entering the United States, and believe the party could have done more to slow Trump's rise. They point out a particular irony: The party that insisted it couldn't intercede in the 2016 nominating contest is now threatening to use its leverage to undercut individual candidates in future races. Saul Anuzis, a former Michigan GOP chairman who helmed Cruz's state effort in the primary, defended pledge-breaking candidates, arguing that ""circumstances change"" -- a reference to the pledge's creation as a tool to keep Trump from launching an independent campaign. He said he doesn't see how Priebus could impose penalties on future presidential candidates. ""There's no provisions in the RNC rules that allow anybody to punish anybody,"" Anuzis said. ""The idea of doing that, I think, is extremely difficult, because you normally are looking toward the future, not the past.""",0.0170919,0.00198167,0.0029725040000000004,0.005945009,0.029972752000000002,0.21624969,0.002477087,2,-1,1

"Frustration is growing within DonaldTrump campaign over the Republicannominee yawning money gap with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton -- just as the presidential race heads into its final fall stretch.Trump top advisers have held a series of tense conversations in recent days about how to close a fundraising holethat grown to over $200 million ? a deficitthat led Trump to essentially cede the TV airwaves to his Democratic rival. The discussions, which were relayed by more than a half-dozen sources, have veered into finger pointing, with some participants pinning the blame on the Republican National Committee or on Steven Mnuchin,Trump national finance chairman and a newcomer to the political scene. Story Continued Below The shortfall is putting Trump at a substantial disadvantage during the remaining few weeks of the campaign, as focus shifts to the clinical ? and costly -- process of bringing voters out to the polls. ?Between him dissing the donors in the primary and donors being more concerned about Congress, as they should be,it a significant gap for him to close,? said former GOP Rep. Vin Weber, a prominent Washington lobbyist and fundraiser. ?I have to believe the Clinton campaign will know how to spend their money effectively during the last 45 days.? Last Thursday,Trump top brass, including Mnuchin, chief operating officer Eli Miller, Donald Trump Jr., son-in-law Jared Kushner gathered in Trump Tower with Republican National Committee Chief of Staff Katie Walsh. At one point, Dallas investor Gentry Beach, a Trump fundraiser who has long been one of Donald Trump Jr.?s closest friends, launched into what four sources who were present described as a pointed critique of the RNC, which he said was coming up short. Gentry asked why hedidn have access to theRNC donor data, two of the sources said -- implying that the committee was deliberately withholding critical information. To those assembled, the critiquewasn entirely new ? for weeks, tensions between Trump and the establishment-minded RNC have simmered over resources and the direction of the campaign. While some Trump aides argue that the committee has been less than helpful, many within the RNC are convinced the New York businessman is waging a lackluster campaign. But Kushner, a wealthy real estate executive and New York Observer publisher who has taken on an increasingly influential role in the campaign, pushed back forcefully ? telling Beach in no uncertain terms that the Dallas investordidn know what he was talking about. Kushner, who is regularly in touch with Walsh and party chairman Reince Priebus, argued that the committee had been proven itself to be responsive. He reserved particular praise for Walsh. In an email, Beach disputed the characterization of the exchange but declined to go into specifics. An RNC spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. The tensions spilled over into a Monday conference call that stretched on for nearly an hour. Roy Bailey, a Dallas insurance executive and longtime GOP fundraiser who is close to former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, urged the campaign to reach out to the large number of Republican donors who remain on the sidelines. At no point did Bailey explicitly attack Mnuchin, but three sources on the call said his critique was implicit ? and clear: The campaign was failing to take the routine, obvious steps. Mnuchin pushed back. Yes,he be happy to contact still-uncommitted contributors. But the situation was complex. There were a number of major GOP donors who were aligned with the establishment and simplywouldn give to Trump, so why waste the effort? The discussion went on for a while longer, with Bailey arguing that new polls showing a tightening race could get some people to open their wallets.That when Woody Johnson jumped in. By that point, the call had gone on for nearly 45 minutes, and Johnson ? the billionaire owner of the New York Jets ? had had enough. Addressing Bailey directly, Johnson said that the best way to win over uncommitted donors was by contacting them, not sitting on conference calls. Then, the Jets owner abruptly hung up. Bailey did not respond to a request for comment, and a Johnson representative declined to discuss his role on the call. Reached on Friday, Mnuchin disputed the notion that disagreements had cropped up. ?The campaign has an amazing relationship with the RNC,? he said. ?We have been operating as one unified team for the past five months and achieved amazing success in all aspects of our fundraising.? The flare-up comes at a critical juncture in the campaign, as both sides turn their attention to voter turnout. Clinton has used her formidable financial advantage to significantly out-organize Trump, investing seven times the amount of money on TV ads and opening up dozens more swing-state field offices than her Republican opponent. Fundraising reports released this week painted a stark picture: While Clinton had raised $373 million to date, Trump had taken in $165 million. Particularly concerning for Trump were revelations this week that Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, one of the RepublicanParty biggest donors, had decided to direct just $5 million toward electing the GOP presidential nominee. Adelson,who once been expected to invest as much as $100 million in Trump, is instead focusing the vast majority of his political giving on down-ballot races. In the days sinceMonday call, andJohnson abrupt signoff, other members ofTrump finance circle have been stewing overBailey remarks. Many of them believethey made the best out of a bad situation, pointing out that in the face of ongoing resistance from many of theparty top donors and lacking the infrastructure of past GOP presidential nominees,they managed to fund a national campaign. They also argue that the campaign has made serious strides in fundraising. Next week, it will hold two high-dollar events in New York City, one which will feature Ivanka Trump and the other that will be hosted by Trump and his vice presidential nominee, Mike Pence. And on Tuesday, the day after the first debate,Trump fundraisers will convene at Trump Tower to hold a ? national call day ? in hopes of winning over still-uncommitted donors. The campaign, tapping intoTrump popularity among blue collar voters, has also developed a vaunted small-dollar operation that has raised around $100 million from contributorswho given $200 or less. Some of those helping Trump raise money were quick to defend Mnuchin, an ex-Goldman Sachs executive and former film producer who has far less political experience than his counterparts on previous presidential campaigns. They noted that Trump did not hold his first major fundraiser until late May, long after when nominees typically begin their pursuit of big-dollar donors. ""Given the totality of circumstances and the timing of the race, Steve has done a heroic job and he is one of the smartest people I have met on a campaign,? said Anthony Scaramucci, a Wall Street investor and Republican fundraiser who is helping to organize nextweek national call day. ?Which is why he was probably smart enough to have never done this before.?",0.016029593,0.003699137,0.002466091,0.004932182,0.040690506,0.251541307,0.006165228000000001,2,-1,1
"The whole world is talking about Donald Trump, over which he is no doubt preening because any attention is good attention as long asit focused entirely on him. But besides the obvious problems with this,there one traditionthat very important among international leaders and diplomats. Trump is getting dangerously close to destroying it. The tradition is this: Youdon trash-talk a foreigncountry political candidates. That might seem silly. It might seem trivial.It not. This is a very old tradition that was actually turned into policy at the 1961 Vienna Convention. While different countries interpret ?Thou shalt not interfere in foreign countries? elections? differently, most are careful to keep their mouths shut, at least publicly. Even in 2004, when the whole world hated George W. Bush for the fiasco that was Iraq, foreign diplomats and leaders mostly kept quiet. Not so now. Trump is testingeveryone patience, and many find that they justcan keep it to themselves: ?If you represent one of these countries that has been insulted or attacked, you tend to react. We are very passionate, and our blood is pretty hot. But we have to play it cool and understand that this is a campaign, and an election, and that we are diplomats.? This week, thousands of foreign diplomats are gathering in New York City for the U.N. General Assembly. Trump has insulted a great many of them in one way or another. What the Latin-American diplomat said to Politico is true around the world: ?Adding to the complications is that U.S. elections are increasingly followed intensely by people overseas, whetherit via Facebook or CNN International. So when a U.S. presidential candidate slams a foreign country as Trump has so often (with Mexico, Japan, China, members of NATO, and on and on) representatives of those countries feel unusual domestic pressure to respond.? Wars of words could easily escalate into more serious wars with Trump.He proven that with his threats against both Ted Cruz and John Kasich for the 2018 midterms ? hecan let a slight go. As another example of how he goes after everyone who pisses him off:He busy trash-talking a Scottish whiskey company for daring to give an award to a neighbor of his who criticizes his golf course. In retaliation,he banned every brand of whiskey from William Grant & Sons for that affront, because really, how dare they? He should have more important things to worry about than petty personal slights, butthey actually the centerpiece of his whole existence. When foreign leaderswon play ball his way, and go on record with nothing but what he thinks are insults,what he going to do? Two guesses whathe do, butyou only need one. Hehasn even been elected yet and foreign leaders and diplomats are openly attacking him. Some of these people probably held their tongues when George W. was running for re-election, however hard that might have been. This would be hilarious if itwasn so frightening.

"In case you have been living under a rock, we recently learned that Hillary Clinton is human through a series of reports about That One Time She Coughed and The Time She Got Pneumonia. Yes, somehow anytime Clinton gets the sniffles, the Right pounces on it, using anything and everything they can to push absolutely bonkers conspiracy theories about the former Secretary ofState health (she?s on her deathbed,don). During an interview withACB Sarina Fazan Wednesday, the reporter asked Clinton perhaps one of the dumbest f*cking questions she has been asked regarding her health: if she would undergo ?neurocognitive tests? to appease inflated, only-existing-on-Trump?s-side-of-the-aisle concerns about whether or not her presidency will be like a four-year-long edition of Weekend atBernie. Hillary just laughed in her face. ?I?m very sorry I got pneumonia,I glad antibiotics took care of it, andthat behind us now,? the former Secretary of State said, somehow managing to avoid knocking the reporter for starting off by claiming 9/11 was ?last week.? Clinton explained that her health meets and exceeds the standards anyone else running for office has met, but Fazan was all ?so, ummmm, you gonna take those tests?? ?There?s no need for that,? Clinton said firmly, surely wondering how the f*ck this woman got hired in the first place. ?The information is very clear.? Hillarywasn the only person laughing at Fazan, who also beat the dead horse that is the email ?scandal.?

"Ahmad Khan Rahami, earlier named a person of interest in the weekend explosions in New York City and New Jersey, has been charged with five counts of attempted murder of a law enforcement officer. He is also charged with second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Interested in New York? Add New York as an interest to stay up to date on the latest New York news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Rahami was taken into custody and hospitalized this morning after a shootout with police in Linden, New Jersey, the Union County acting prosecutor said today. He has been ""directly linked"" to the devices used in the New York and New Jersey explosions on Saturday, FBI official Bill Sweeney said. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said this afternoon there is ""every reason to believe this was an act of terror."" But there is ""no indication that there is a cell operating in the area or in the city,"" Sweeney said, adding that ""the investigation is ongoing."" ""We will continue to conduct investigative activity to ensure we completely understand Rahami's social network,"" Sweeney said. ""For that reason, I do not plan to answer specific questions about our techniques, or our knowledge of the devices."" Rahami was taken into custody in Linden, about 4 miles south of Elizabeth, after being injured in the altercation, during which a responding officer was shot in his bulletproof vest and second officer was injured. Union CountyProsecutor Office Rahami was taken to a hospital in Newark, where he is undergoing surgery, said Grace Park, the Union County acting prosecutor. The extent of his injuries was not immediately clear. The confrontation happened at about 10:30 a.m., when an owner of a Linden bar reported that someone was sleeping in a hallway of his establishment, Linden Mayor Derek Armstead told ABC New York station WABC. The bar owner, Harry Bains, told ABC station WABC in an exclusive interview that ""it was my gut reaction"" to call the police. Armstead said, ""One of our police officers went to investigate and to wake him up and realized that he was [Rahami], the suspect that had been being sought in the bombings."" ""He realized it was the suspect, and within moments, the suspect fired on him,"" Armstead said. ""And thank God that he had his vest on. And I think that was very helpful for him. I think that saved his life."" Ed Murray/NJ Advance Media for NJ.com President Barack Obama said this afternoon that he spoke on the phone with the officers who apprehended Rahami. ""They are going to be fine, they sustained some modest injuries but ones thatthey rapidly recover from,"" Obama said. ""They were in good spirits and I communicated to them of how appreciative the American people are."" A source briefed on the investigation said agents are searching for other people they want to talk to and that the investigation is not over. An alert sent shortly before 8 a.m. today said police were seeking a man in connection with the Saturday night bombing in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood -- identified by authorities as Rahami, 28. He is believed to be the man seen in surveillance video at both the scene of the explosion on West 23rd Street and on West 27th Street, where the unexploded device was found, a police source said. Eduardo Munoz/Reuters His last known address was in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The address of a home searched by FBI agents in Elizabeth this morning is linked to a person with a similar name. Rahami is a U.S. citizen of Afghan descent. New Jersey State Police Sources said authorities believe the three bombs -- one exploding in an oceanfront town on the New Jersey shore, one in Manhattan and another in Elizabeth, a town bordering Newark International Airport, just beyond New York City's borders -- are related. Sweeney said today the explosion in Elizabeth is still under investigation. NYPD The explosions did not cause any fatalities, but the Chelsea explosion injured 29 people. The incident have put residents, police and other security personnel on high alert. De Blasio, on ""Good Morning America"" today, praised the NYPD's response to the threat and said the department has ""the largest anti-terror force of any police force in the country."" The latest incident was Sunday night in Elizabeth, about 15 miles southwest of the Chelsea neighborhood in Manhattan. Police recovered five possible homemade pipe bombs in a backpack, and one device exploded early today as a police robot attempted to disarm it. The FBI's Newark office tweeted that its bomb technicians had responded to the scene, along with investigators from Union County and the State Police of New Jersey. No one was injured. ABC NEWS The Manhattan blast took place on West 23rd Street around 8:30 p.m. Saturday and injured 29 people. All the injured have been released from hospitals, Mayor de Blasio said. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters Sunday night there was no evidence of international involvement. But he said today he considers the explosion an act of terrorism. ""I believe it was an act of terrorism,"" he said. ""I believe you set off a bomb and you try to set off a second bomb, that is an appearance of trying to intimidate New Yorkers."" He added, ""Yesterday there was no hint of any connection to foreigner terrorism."" ""No group had taken accountability. No group had put out a statement. It was very early in the investigation. It still is early. But there may very well turn out to be a link to foreign terrorist organizations,"" he said. ""We will find that out today or in the coming days."" Andres Bayona Andres Kudacki/AP Photo New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez called the incidents ""clearly an act of terrorism."" In the search after the Chelsea explosion, officials found a possible second device on 27th Street, said James O'Neill, the city's police commissioner. The second device, described as a pressure cooker, was removed and did not explode. The first incident of the weekend was Saturday morning, when an apparent improvised explosive device was set off in Seaside Park, New Jersey, a beach town about 90 miles south of New York City. The device went off along the route of a planned 5K charity race to benefit U.S. Marines and sailors. Because of delays with the start of the run, the explosion occurred before many people were nearby. Andres Kudacki/AP Photo Officials announced late Sunday night the detention of up to five individuals in connection with Saturday night's explosion in Chelsea. No charges were made, and the individuals are no longer in custody, the FBI's Sweeney said today. ""I'm not going to discuss what they could face in the potential future,"" he said. As the investigations continue, officials in New York City are preparing to host heads of government from around the world at the annual United Nations General Assembly this week in Manhattan.

"This Black Man Hates Cops, Then His Sister Was Killed And Something Changed? Holy cow, I started crying when I read this post. Mark Ross had just found out that his sister had been killed in a car accident by some dumb punk. His number 1 priority was to get to his mom to comfort her a couple states away. He had a friend drive him even though his friend had a suspended license. In Ohio, they were pulled over for a traffic violation and Ross was thinking, ?We?re going to jail,? because his friend was driving illegally and he had a warrant out for his arrest. The State Trooper had the car towed so they were stranded. Ross, breaking into tears explained to the other police officer who showed up, Sgt. David Robison, that his sister was just killed and he was trying to get to his mom to comfort her. Instead of arresting him, Sgt. Robison offered to drive him 100 miles (as far as he could go) to drop him closer to family. Just as Robison was dropping him off, he asked if he could pray for him. Ross? Facebook post explains the moment, ?He REACHES OVER AND BEGAN PRAYING OVER ME AND MY FAMILY.? ? 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now Ross then goes on to explain to his friends that, ?Everybody knows how much I dislike Cops, but I am truly Grateful for this Guy. He gave me hope.? The one thing you can get from this story is that ALL Lives Matter and true humanitydoesn see color. This cop helped a young man who was in pain because THAT is humanity and THAT is what police officers do. They are not trained to do it, it is in their blood. Most people join the police force because they want to help people. I am grateful for this Christian man who helped a young man gain hope and comfort. This nationdoesn need a movement of Black Lives Matter or Any Lives Matter? this nation needs more Christian people doing their duty as Christians to succor the weak or weary. Our national campaignshouldn be #BLM but #WWJD. We all need to remember when we go to work, the grocery store or drive down the street? what would Jesus do, what would he do for YOU? What HAS Jesus done for your family? How can you reciprocate Jesus? love and be more like Him who suffered every inhumanity there was and then rose above it all?

"Story highlights The NRA had not been on TV since last last month The ad shows what the NRA says would happen if Clinton appoints Supreme Court justices Washington (CNN) The National Rifle Association is returning to the defense of Donald Trump in the closing weeks of the presidential campaign, a reminder of how fervently the gun-rights group has backed the Republican nominee on television. The NRA is launching a $5 million TV ad campaign Tuesday, the group says, meant to turn out pro-Second Amendment voters at a time when Trump is being attacked for his language about firearms. The gun lobby has aired $7.7 million in television time on Trump's behalf, support that makes it the second-most active pro-Trump advertiser in the general election. But it had not been on the airwaves since late last month. The NRA's Political Victory Fund is tasked with spending half the money on five swing states -- Ohio, Nevada, Virginia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania -- while its Institute for Legislative Action, its lobbying arm, is spending the second-half on national cable. All of the money is going to a harrowing ad that shows what the NRA says would happen if Hillary Clinton appoints her chosen justices to the Supreme Court. ""She'll call 9-1-1. Average response time? 11 minutes,"" says the narrator as a sleeping woman is startled by nighttime footsteps. The woman runs to a nearby safe to grab her weapon, but it's empty. ""Don't let Hillary leave you protected with nothing but a phone."" The advertisements targets rural voters in battleground states who might be Democrats or disillusioned Republicans, according to Jennifer Baker, an NRA spokeswoman.

"This Florida cop is being called the super cop after this incredible feat of choke slamming one man who thought he was big enough to bully kids without consequence, while at the same time subduing the other bully and calling for backup. More from Mad World News The entire incident was caught on tape and put up on Facebook by Darrell Lynn Tate II. The video starts as Sergeant Bryan Bingham was called to the St. Pete Beach in Pinellas County after Josh McMahan, 25, threatened fellow beachgoers. A Florida officer is being hailed as Supercopafter putting a pair of bullies in their place. After choke slamming the first obnoxious subject, the officer is able to keep him under control, restrain the other aggressor, and call for backup at the same time. Although it should have been a conversation between the two, the altercation turned physical, prompting Bingham to take down McMahan ? which he did with an epic choke slam. This if course resulted in the large group of spring breakers to erupt in cheering after seeing what the loudmouth bully had earlier done. However, it also brought about a friend ofMcMahan, Justin Lewis, 24, who attempted to intervene. Apparently he missed the ?don?t touch a cop? memo his friend just got as he too tried to get physical with Bingham. As Bingham was still on top of McMahan, he simply tried to get a belligerent Lewis to leave before shouting, ?Back up!? and pushing him to the ground. Rather than do what he was told, Lewis got back to his feet and once again tried to free his friend. Fed up beachgoers could then be seen kicking sand on the back of McMahan, as OfficerBingham attention was now focused on Lewis.

Sessions expressed frustration with Republicans who've refused to back Trump in an interview with the Washington Examiner published Wednesday. A long-serving Republican senator, he was among the first members of the so-called GOP ""establishment"" to throw his support behind the eventual nominee during the primary, and has been a fixture of the Trump campaign since. ""They should objectively analyze who is likely to advance best the agenda they favor and the agenda the Republicans who supported them favored. And that's clearly Donald Trump,"" Sessions said. The Alabama Republican also noted that ""millions of Americans, including this one, worked their hearts out for the Bushes in 1988, 1992, 2000, and 2004. And it wasn't Bill Clinton that helped the Bushes get elected. It was the same voters, in large part, that elected Ronald Reagan and stand to elect Donald Trump.""

"Story highlights Some Mormon voters have grown concerned with Donald Trump Supporters are touting Clinton's values and commitment to religious liberty White Plains, New York (CNN) Hillary Clinton's supporters in the Beehive State have launched Utah Mormons for Hillary, according to a release from the campaign, the latest attempt to court a group of people deeply skeptical of Donald Trump. Clinton's campaign has sought to draw a wedge between Mormons -- a religious group that makes up about 60% of Utah, according to some estimates -- and Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. Some Mormon voters have grown concerned by Trump's candidacy, citing questions they have about his principles and comments he has made that hint at religious persecution. The goal, according to David Irvine, a former Republican member of the Utah House of Representatives and a member of the the organization, is to convince people within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to pick Clinton over Trump by touting the former secretary of state's values and commitment to religious liberty. Since its founding in 1830, Mormons have been persecuted and chased out of a number of areas they tried to settle. Members of the faith, after being expelled from Ohio, Illinois and Missouri, eventually settled in Utah in 1847.

"The impact of one line zingers can fade after the moment, but gaffes can linger, altering a race and shifting the momentum. Mistakes happen in almost every debate. And as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump meet for their first clash Monday -- 56 years to the date after the famous showdown between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy -- viewers will be on alert for any stumbles that might seal the fate of either candidate. Here are eight of the biggest blunders from nearly six decades of presidential debates: Nixon vs. Kennedy, 1960 The first televised general election debate featured a candidate who understood the power of television and one who didn't. John F. Kennedy, tall, young and confident, looked into the camera and addressed 80 million viewers. JUST WATCHED Debates enter the TV age Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Debates enter the TV age 00:27 Richard Nixon, pale and recovering from the flu, shifted his eyes, looking unfocused as he addressed the questioners rather than the viewers. Nixon was also sweaty and unshaven. People who listened to the debate on the radio thought Nixon won. People who watched the debate thought Kennedy won. The next day's Chicago Daily News headline summed up the importance of the visuals: ""Was Nixon Sabotaged by TV Makeup Artists?"" It went so badly for Nixon that for the next 16 years, general election candidates avoided televised debates. Ford vs. Carter, 1976 So memorable was President Gerald Ford's gaffe that it made it into his obituary. Asked about the expansion of Russian power in Eastern Europe, Ford flatly denied it. Carter and President Gerald Ford debate domestic policy at the Walnut Street Theater in Philadelphia on September 23, 1976. It was the first of three Ford-Carter presidential debates. ""There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration,"" he said. Flummoxed, the moderator gave Ford a chance to modify his response. But Ford stuck by his response throughout the debate, insisting that Poland, Yugoslavia, and Romania were all ""independent and autonomous."" Sometimes thought of as ""the accidental president,"" Ford's bumbling response only highlighted the sense among some that he wasn't quite right for the job. Dukakis vs. Bush, 1988 The question wasn't hard. ""Governor,"" CNN's Bernard Shaw asked, ""if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?"" JUST WATCHED 1988: 'If Kitty Dukakis were raped...' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 1988: 'If Kitty Dukakis were raped...' 01:07 It was an easy opportunity for Michael Dukakis, the Democratic governor of Massachusetts, to sound human. But he whiffed and discussed his ironclad opposition to the death penalty. He talked about how Massachusetts had the lowest murder rate in the country. And he criticized then-Vice President George H.W. Bush over his drug war policies. What he didn't do in his two-minute response is talk about this wife, Kitty. The next day, Kitty Dukakis called the question shocking and inappropriate. Dukakis later admitted that he made a mistake by answering such a raw question so clinically. Bush vs. Clinton vs. Perot, 1992 Just as an audience member stood up to ask President George H.W. Bush about how the national debt had personally affected him, he checked his watch. And in that moment, he provided Bill Clinton an opening. He also gave viewers of the first presidential town hall the impression that he just didn't care and that he had better things to do with his time. The Arkansas governor pounced, showing his rare gift of connecting with voters by approaching the questioner and painting a picture of a wrecked economy where her friends and neighbors had lost jobs. Clinton, Bush, and Perot at a presidential town hall in 1992. The debate echoed a New York Times headline months earlier that suggested he was out of touch with average voters?""Bush Encounters the Supermarket, Amazed."" Bush later said that in the moment he was thinking: ""I hate these debates. I'm so glad it's almost over."" Bush vs. Gore, 2000 Vice President Al Gore just couldn't hide his exasperation. Especially not after Republican operatives spliced together a clip of him sighing and sighing again and again during his first presidential debate against George W. Bush. After the sighing reel was circulated, the entire narrative of the first debate changed. JUST WATCHED Al Gore sighs while Bush speaks Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Al Gore sighs while Bush speaks 00:38 The post-debate spin effectively turned a debate night victory into a loss for Gore in the days that followed. Columnists mocked him.

"As the candidates jabbed one another over and over again, Lester Holt kept trying to jump in. | Getty Lester Holt stays out of the way Under pressure, he lets the candidates have their say, but leaves some important topics uncovered. Lester Holt was on an island on Monday night. And for most of the first presidential debate, he stayed there, letting the battleships of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump shoot their missiles at one another. It made for some memorable exchanges between Trump and Clinton, matched in close-up on most networks. For some debate watchers,that what they want their moderators to do: say ""go"" and let them run. But it also left some gaps where viewers probably expected sharp questions. Story Continued Below There was no probing ofTrump wall with Mexico, and vow to get the Mexicans to pay for it, or the Republicannominee ban on Muslims entering the country. And he barely prodded Clinton to explain her private email server in a question so gently worded that she was able to dispatch the issue with a few taut sentences. The Clinton Foundation?Wasn discussed; neither was the Benghazi attack. Few moderators have faced such intense scrutiny in the days leading up to the debate as Holt did, withClinton allies demanding he serve as a fact-checker andTrump backers insisting that he allow the candidates to have their say. Before the network broadcasts began, Holt seemed to reveal his choice, telling the audience he wanted to facilitatethe conversation between ?just the two of them.? Holt is often seen as understated. His arrival on the national stage was under the radar, as he quietly assumed the NBC anchor chair while Brian Williams? career was careening to a halt, removed as anchor of ?Nightly News? over allegations he exaggerated his experience covering the Iraq war. But during the debate, that understated approach sometimes led to the candidates, especially Trump, rolling over his questions, with Holt at one point admitting that they were far behind schedule. It started early, during the first segment about the economy. Holt asked Trump how he specifically will help put money back in the pocket of Americans. Trump offered few specifics, veering into criticism ofClinton decades of public service without improving trade agreements. Holt tried to interrupt but Trump kept rolling. He managed, a few seconds later, to follow up, pressing for specifics. But the end of the first segment would lead some critics on Twitter to ask ?Where?s Lester?"" ""Apparently Lester Holt went to the bathroom, way down the hall, and only one urinal is available and there is a line,? joked National Review writer Jim Geraghty in a tweet. As Clinton and Trump sparred over debate and taxes, jabbing one another over and over again, Holt kept trying to jump in. ""Let me get you to pause right there,? he said as Trump was claiming Clinton was going to ?approve one of the biggest tax increases."" ""Lester, that can't be left to stand,? Clinton shot back, one of several times she asked Holt to ?turn back the clock? or step in as Trump steamrolled through questions. When Trump continuously interrupted Clinton during her answers, Holt would at most offer a pleading,""This is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please."" ButHolt understatementdidn mean he was completely walked over. At different points, Holt pushed back against both candidates. ""Last week you said we have to do everything possible to improve policing to go right at implicit bias. Do you believe police are implicitly biassed against black people?? Holt asked Clinton. And as the debate went on, he became more engaged and pushed back harder against Trump, on his birtherism, Iraq War support and his taxes. When Trump tried to assert again, falsely, that he was always against the Iraq war, Holt was sure to not step into the same problems his colleague Matt Lauer, who letTrump claim hedidn support the Iraq war slide. Initially, Holt did not interrupt when Trump barked Wrongas Clinton said he supported the war. But a few moments later, he came back. ?The record shows otherwise,? Holt said, later referring toTrump 2002 interview with Howard Stern, which Trump himself then later said that in the interview with Stern said he said ""who knows."" The reaction from the media and pundits was mixed, though mostly positive. ?[Holt] provided some realtime fact checking but let Trump go off on tangents and repeat too many proven lies,? said Washingotn Post Media columnist Margaret Sullivan, giving holt a ?B-minus? grade. ""[Holt] didn't make himself the story, and was dignified, if medium-weak and sometimes absent."" Former CNN Washington Bureau Chief Frank Sesno offered: ""I think Holt has done an excellent job. Has been firm and fair, called Trump on statements more than Hillary but spent most of his efforts steering the conversation / debate to the two candidates.? Not everyone was not as happy with how Holt treated Trump. ""Has the moderator challenged Clinton on anything?? tweeted the tax-cut activist Grover Norquist. ?Lester Holt interrupted Mr. Trump more, he followed up with Mr. Trump more, he was much hard on Mr. Trump,? complained Trump senior advisor Boris Epshteyn. ""Lester Holt, to a degree, succumbed to the pressure form the left wing media and the Democrats after Matt Lauer moderated the forum."" Hugh Hewitt, the conservative talk show host,didn seem to agree. ""Conservatives should agree @LesterHoltNBC did a very fine job moderating. He pushed on birther issue and Iraq war but gave plenty of time,? he tweeted. Trump himself seemed perfectly happy withHolt performance. ""I thought Lester Holt did a great job. ...

Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) Despite improving poll numbers, Donald Trump still faces the political equivalent of pulling an inside straight if he is to succeed to the presidency, says Karl Rove, mastermind behind both of President George W. Bush's presidential campaigns. ""Democrats have an easier path to 270 Electoral College votes than Republicans,"" Rove told David Axelrod on ""The Axe Files"" podcast, produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN. That advantage makes Hillary Clinton the continued front-runner in the race headed into next week's critical first debate, Rove said. ""He's got to win all the Romney states, and as you know, three of them are up for grabs -- North Carolina, he's behind; Arizona, Georgia, barely ahead. He's got to win Florida, got to win Ohio, but that only gets him to 253. He's got to find another 17, and I think he'll win Nevada, I think he'll win Iowa, but even then that only gets him to 265. And that last five, he's got to win either New Hampshire and the second district of Maine, or Pennsylvania, or Michigan, or Wisconsin."" Rove, a columnist for the Wall Street Journal, is a chairman of the Crossroads super PAC, which has thus far refused to deploy its significant resources on Trump's behalf, focusing instead on preserving Republican control of the United States Senate. The GOP entered the year in an uphill battle for the Senate, with six Republican incumbents running for reelection in blue states President Obama carried in 2012. Democrats must seize five seats, or win four and the presidency, to wrest control of the upper chamber away from the GOP.

"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed: Bill Clinton: NaturalFor Foundation Donors to Seek FavorsHere Google: Naturally, my reaction was ?oh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage hiswife campaign now?? Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most peopledon do, to find out the real story ? and the real story is that there is no pay to play. ?It was natural for peoplewho been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Departmentwouldn do anything theyshouldn do,? Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainlydoesn meanthey get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, butthere no evidence they got them. Now,let talk about the foundation the mediadoesn like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trumphasn given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigatingTrump charitable foundation over concerns that it ?engaged in some impropriety? as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others? contributions ?to make them appear to have come from him? although he ?hasn?t given to the foundation since 2008.? Source: Media Matters Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost ofClinton candidacy: Journalists have been criticized for the ?double standard? in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage toClinton pneumonia diagnosis as The WashingtonPost reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of DonaldTrump Dr. Oz stunt. All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton scandal(if you call getting sick a ?scandal?) while ignoring every scandal inTrump closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

"Story highlights A group of scientists released an open letter on Tuesday urging action on climate change The scientists called for support of the Paris climate change agreement (CNN) A group of 375 ""concerned"" scientists -- including famed physicist Stephen Hawking -- released an open letter Tuesday sharply criticizing Donald Trump, citing the threat of climate change and blasting his push for the US to leave the Paris Accord. ""It is of great concern that the Republican nominee for President has advocated U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Accord. A 'Parexit' would send a clear signal to the rest of the world: 'The United States does not care about the global problems of human-caused climate change. You are on your own,'"" the group wrote on the website responsiblescientists.org The use of the term ""Parexit"" is a reference to a political withdrawal along the lines of the UK's vote to leave the European Union, commonly called the ""Brexit."" They continued, ""The consequences of opting out of the global community would be severe and long-lasting -- for our planet's climate and for the international credibility of the United States."" The letter is signed by a number of famous scientists, including Hawking and Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu, who served as Secretary of Energy under President Barack Obama.

"Share Tweet Email address: Leave this field empty if you're human:I so disappointed by this. We mentioned this on our show earlier this week, but the Perpetually Offended Brigade set their sights onDisney Maui Halloween Costume, calling it brownfaceand disrespectful to Polynesian cultures, and cultural appropriation, and probably a bunch of other stupid things that only perpetually offended losers get bent out of shape about.Here the Maui character from the upcoming Disney film Moana. Perhaps you remember the outrage from a couple months ago, when people decided they were also angry that the Maui character is fat. If you missed that story, here you go. In that post, we are reminded that Maui is a demi-god character in an ANIMATED FICTIONAL DISNEY MOVIE. And yet, people are still mad. But the outrage went even further, because now people are mad about the Maui Halloween costume.Here what it looks like: Infuriating, huh. I mean, how DARE they create a costume that so closely resembles the character? Someone correct me ifI wrong, butisn the point of dressing up as a character for Halloween to look AS MUCH LIKE THAT CHARACTER as possible? And if in fact, that IS the point, then WTF is all the fuss about? The costume is made to look like the character. WHICH IS FICTIONAL.That it. End of story. But squeaky wheels apparently get the grease in our culture now, so Disney has pulled the costume, which I think is patently ridiculous. They will no longer sell it. Their statement said: ?The team behind Moanahas taken great care to respect the cultures of the Pacific Islands that inspired the film, and we regret that the Maui costume has offended some. We sincerely apologize and are pulling the costume from our website and stores.? Translation: We have no backbone. Or testicles. Or common sense. Please add this to the ever-growing list of things that progressives insist on being total killjoys about. Way to let the SJW morons win, Disney.
