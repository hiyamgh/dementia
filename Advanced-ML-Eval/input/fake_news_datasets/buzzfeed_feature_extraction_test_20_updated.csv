"Story highlights Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe was photographed with Willie Nelson, and Nelson's marijuana Nelson was in Bristow Saturday for a Farm Aid 2016 concert (CNN) Hanging out with Willie Nelson over the weekend has left a cloud around Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, after a photo of McAuliffe and the legendary marijuana-loving musician tweeted by Nelson's wife, Annie Nelson, included a can of ""Willie's Reserve"" -- Nelson's brand of weed. It's sold in Colorado and is legal in Washington, but not Virginia -- a reality Annie Nelson might have been alluding to when she captioned the picture: """"UH-OH Trouble!"" McAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that the Democratic governor has never used drugs in his life -- and isn't cool enough to know what Willie's Reserve is. ""He was not and still is not aware of whatever was on the table or anywhere around him and wouldn't know marijuana or related paraphernalia if it walked up and shook his hand,"" Coy said. ""He's cool, but he's not that cool."" The newspaper's political reporter, Graham Moomaw, tweeted a zoomed-in photo of the can of Willie's Reserve weed, next to a pair of glasses and a remote control.

"Rep. Peter King: We shouldn't be 'pandering' to political correctness New York Rep. Peter King rejected former Secretary of State HillaryClinton focus on the need for law enforcement to do a better job of building trust with American Muslims. Instead, the 11-term congressman called for more surveillance within the community. ?I disagree with her when she puts the emphasis on building trust with the Muslim community, they have no reason not to trust the police,? King said on MSNBC shortly after Clinton answered questions from the press on theweekend bombing in Manhattan. Story Continued Below King is not new to this topic. His insistence to hold hearings on homegrown radicalization within Islam drew comparisons to Sen. JosephMcCarthy infamous communist witch hunt. (King has said he considers such attacks on him a ""badge of honor."") As she has before, Clinton called for an intelligence surge to thwartISIL efforts to inspire terror, but cautioned against a broader offensive against a faith. But the only way to gather such intelligence, King said, is to step up surveillance. ?So listen, it's not going to be the handshake of a friendship that's going to bring Muslim Americans outside,? King said. ?To get more intelligence, you have to do that by surveillance, by undercovers.That what has been done with every other ethnic group in this country when there is crime, whether it's the Westies and the Irish, whetherit the Italians and the mafia, that's how you do it.

"Story highlights Donald Trump is again defending stop-and-frisk policing tactic He says it will help save lives Melbourne, Florida (CNN) Donald Trump argued Tuesday that the controversial stop-and-frisk policing tactic once employed in New York City is constitutional, adding that it would ""overwhelmingly"" save African-American and Hispanic lives. The practice, however, has been criticized as racial profiling that unfairly targeted those very minority groups. Trump quibbled with debate moderator Lester Holt on Monday night after Holt pointed out that the stop-and-frisk practice as implemented in New York City was ruled unconstitutional. ""I explained last night that stop-and-frisk is constitutional,"" Trump said at a Florida rally, speaking of a back-and-forth he had with debate moderator Lester Holt of NBC News during Monday night's presidential debate. While stop-and-frisk policies are used in various US cities, the aggressive implementation of stop-and-frisk in New York was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge in 2013, who said the policy violated the rights of minorities who were disproportionately targeted. ""Stop, question and frisk"" remains a policing practice in New York, but has been dramatically reined in. But Trump pressed the issue even as he continued to make entreaties to African-American voters. Read More",0.026490066,0.0,0.0,0.006622517,0.066225166,0.264900662,0.006622517,2,-1,1

"Story highlights Obama has taken steps toward solidifying the alliance with Israel this month His meeting with Netanyahu was likely to be their last face-to-face consultations New York (CNN) President Barack Obama confronted one of his most strained foreign partnerships Wednesday during a final meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the pair making a last attempt at patching up their stormy bond before Obama leaves office. Speaking before their session, Obama said he was aiming to ascertain the prospects for peace in the region as he prepares to end his presidency. ""Our hope will be that in these conversations we get the sense of how Israel sees the next few years, what the opportunities are and what the challenges are in order to ensure we keep alive the possibility of a stable, secure Israel at peace with its neighbors,"" Obama said. ""These are challenging times. One thing that I would say about Prime Minister Netanyahu is that he is always very candid with us."" That candor has become a hallmark of the relationship between Obama and his Israeli counterpart, whom the White House has accused of being less-than-diplomatic in expressing his opposition to US policies like the nuclear agreement with Iran. Obama's 30-minute meeting Wednesday with Netanyahu was likely to be their final opportunity for face-to-face consultations before a new president enters the Oval Office in January. Obama is intent on conferring solid ties with Israel upon his successor, despite the personal animus that developed between him and Netanyahu, as he looks to boost the relationship during the homestretch of a presidential campaign in which he hopes to see Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton prevail.

Among them: resentments. ?Every critic, every detractor, will have to bow down to President Trump,? she says. ?It?s everyonewho ever doubted Donald, whoever disagreed, whoever challenged him ? it is the ultimate revenge to become the most powerful man in the universe.? In the video accompanyingManigault comments, the night of the 2011 White HouseCorrespondent Association dinner is revisited, in which President Obama infamously roasted Donald Trump, who was in attendance. The President, riffing onTrump promotion of the birther conspiracy theory, came at the reality TV star with his comedy guns blazing. Obama heaped joke after joke on Trump during the roast, and reports have indicated that Trump was seething but sitting stone-faced during the monologue. Some now believe that the episode embarrassed Trump so completely that he decided then to run for president as revenge for the humiliation. Regardless of whether that is true or not, history will record that as Obama was crushingTrump spirit, he had already given the green light to theNavy infamous Seal Team Six to go into Pakistan and capture or execute al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.

"A Bar in Virginia Used ColinKaepernick Jersey as a Doormat & Liberals Are Upset After Colin Kaepernick knelt during the National Anthem before a football game, he became a nationally recognized name. Some people decided to burn his jersey for disrespecting our nation and some held him up as a hero of the First Amendment. And there is the owner of Krossroads Rock and Country Bar in Virginia Beach, Virginia who saw the act as disrespectful and decided to make a statement of his own. He used a Kaepernick jersey as a doormat and posted a sign on the door reminding patrons to ?wipe their feet.?

"Last October, Hillary Clinton and her top aides were debating one of those seemingly trivial yet politically consequential decisions that often bedevil a Me Generation candidate in the YouTube era. Should Clinton, at times cautious to the point of rigidity, sing a boozy ballad with her Saturday Night Live impersonator Kate McKinnon at the end of her turn as ?Val the Bartender?? Story Continued Below The internal debate ebbed back and forth -- the candidate herself was ambivalent and some aides thought it would make her look silly. Quietly, they reached out to Philippe Reines, a former Senate and State Department aide whohadn been invited to work on the 2016 campaign, yet had always helped to manage her big-stage moments in the past. Reines urged her to do it. He flew with Clinton in a private jet to New York, negotiated some details of her appearance with the writers at NBC, and stood backstage while she was warbling ?Lean on Me? to provide moral support, according to two people familiar with the situation. The selection of the colorful, combative, cloak-and-dagger, defiantly wise-ass Reines as DonaldTrump stand-in during debate prep sessions, first reported by the New York Times on Saturday, came as a surprise to many outsiders. The idea:Clinton in-house Trump to be someone with no vested interest in pulling a punch -- like SNL alum Al Franken, the Minnesota senator; or financier Robert Wolf, who lobbied for the gig. But it was no shock to the people who know the candidate or the 46-year-old Reines, who lives abachelor life in Washington with two doted-upon cats named after SaddamHussein sons, Uday and Qusay. Clinton, facing what could be the biggest night of her political life on Monday when she squares off against Trump in the first presidential debate of 2016, made an intuitive, even predictable choice, turning to a member of the tiny inner circle she has often relied on in times of maximum stress. The fact that she would tap a trusted defender to portray her most savage enemy says a lot aboutClinton management style, and her circle-the-wagons psyche even during times when other politicians might reach outside for help.There staff, and thenthere the palace guard ? and Reines, despite an up-and-down career with Clinton, is practically Jaime Lannister. ?The debate prep team is made up of people who are really comfortable with her and she's comfortable with them,? saidClinton 2008 campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle, who began her career as young member ofClinton Hillaryland posse in the East Wing in the 1990s. ?Everybody?s always saying Hillary needs to project her authentic self, but Philippe is one of the only ones who knows what that is, and knows how to get her to go along with that,? said a person who knows both. ?He?s the one who urges her to abandon the caution, to go for it. Andshe listen to him, andthat because she trusts him.?Clinton relaxed SNL appearance, self-deprecating but dignified spot, shows why. She flubbed the song but laughed her way through it ? and It worked. Thathasn always been the case for a 68-year-old pop culture staple who struggles to understand pop culture: Many on her staff still regret letting the boss do a deeply awkward version of the ""nae nae"" dance on the Ellen Show. Clinton also trusts Reines precisely because he shares her skepticism ? bordering on hostility ? toward most of the D.C. and national political press to whom he routinely refers as idiotsor worse in private conversation.He famous for his flame-out emails to reporters over the years -- calling former POLITICO blogger and current BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith a moron in a 2008 email, telling the late BuzzFeed correspondent Michael Hastings tof off in another, and challenging yours truly in 2009 to take a lie-detector test after it was suggested Reines was scheming to force Caroline Kennedy out of contention forClinton vacated Senate seat in New York. Clinton aides expressed astonishment that the fakeTrump identityhadn been ferreted out sooner ? Reines has, according to one person with direct knowledge of his involvement, participated in as many as a half-dozen mock debates and more relaxed moot-court sessions, peppering the candidate with lines cribbed fromTrump primary debates and personal attacks meant to keep the candidate off balance. ?Nothing is really off-limits,? the person told POLITICO. ?In some waysit easier for him to say these nasty things to her because she knows he has her best interests at heart.? His brushes with the media ? and his flamethrower reputation with fellow staffers ? left him largely on the sidelines in 2008 until he emerged, late in the primaries, as a travelling adviser and PR bodyguard for Chelsea Clinton ? and, consequentially, as a late add to her debate-prep team. Reines? relationship with Hillary Clinton is personally close, but has been professionally rocky from time to time; she has long told people she likes him ?because he makes me laugh,? but has lectured him for picking public fights and nearly sacked him when he worked for her in the Senate for a variety of over-the-top transgressions, according to former Clinton staffers. Controversy followed him to Foggy Bottom, where he waged endless turf battles and was rapped over the knuckles in an inspectorgeneral report. And Clinton was none too happy when Reines, who has a weakness for too-clever-by-half schemes, handed her a Staples Resetbutton to deliver to dour Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov ? only to be told the Cyrillic inscription was wrong. But Reines endeared himself in other ways, and exhibited skills that serve him in his role as debate stand-in. In 2007, Reines ? then a member ofClinton Senate staff ? oversaw an effort to discredit and defuse a pair of potentially damaging biographies of his boss. He obtained bootlegged pre-publication printouts of the tomes from various sources and distributed the contents to a team of researchers who scoured the texts for errors, inconsistencies and off-key passages he later trotted out inClinton defense. ?Is it possible to quote me yawning?? Reines said when asked to summarize the contents of an investigative biography penned by two New York Times scribes. She loved that one, and has rewarded him with loyalty, even when other called for his scalp. When Clinton accepted BarackObama invitation to run the State Department in late 2008,Obama deputy chief of staff Jim Messina tried to block his appointment as a strategic adviser assigned toClinton personal staff ? and the new secretary overruled the decision and installed Reines as a central member of a management team that included longtime Clinton confidante Cheryl Mills, aide-de-camp Huma Abedin and Jake Sullivan, who is now her campaign policy chief. Prior to the Democratic convention in late July, Reines, who works at a consulting firm that specializes in defense and foreign policy, had been speaking with Clinton from time to time on messaging and press issues, but ?not in a regular, systematic way,? according to one Clinton insider. Around the time ofClinton SNL appearance, Reines accompanied Clinton on a flight to a town hall in New Hampshire moderated by Reines? friend, Todayshow co-host Savannah Guthrie ? but he kept a low profile after that. Then, after the Democratic National Convention,Clinton staff began informally kicking around names for people to play Trump ? a list that included Franken, along with entrepreneur and reality show host Mark Cuban. The sticking point with all of those people, sources told POLITICO, was thecandidate comfort level.It not clear who came up with the idea of tapping him but Sullivan, Abedin and Karen Dunn, one of the lawyers overseeing debate prep sessions (and a Reines friend), backed the idea ? and Clinton quickly approved. There was another consideration: Reines had a day job, but controlled his own hours, and the Trump role, above all, requires ?someone who has lots and lots of free time,? according to one Brooklyn aide. It also required days of cramming, along with hours of YouTube-watching to replicateTrump distinctive speech patterns and habitual lines of attack. Yet there was one skill Reinesdidn have to study up on: New York attitude. ?I was a good Bush for Gore because I am stupid but cocky,? said Paul Begala, a central player in AlGore ill-fated 2000 debate prep effort. ?Philippe is a good Trump for Hillary because he is clever but obnoxious.?

"Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani decided to weigh in on future President HillaryClinton ability to perform as President in a worse way thanTrump staminaremarks at the first presidential debate. According to Giuliani, the fact that Clinton is strong enough and loves her husband enough to make things work after he was unfaithful to her is actually a sign of weakness that disqualifies her from being President just as much as That One Time She Coughed and her almost superhuman ability to work hard and power through pneumonia for days before she finally collapses from the unnatural amount of strain she put on her body. ?The president of the United States, her husband, disgraced this country with what he did in the Oval Office and shedidn just stand by him, she attacked Monica Lewinsky,? Giuliani said followingMonday debate. ?And after being married to Bill Clinton for 20 years, if youdidn know the moment Monica Lewinsky said that Bill Clinton violated her that she was telling the truth, thenyou too stupid to be president.? Bill Clintondidn actually violateanybody. He fooled around with a woman, who was an adult and consented to everything they did, behind hiswife back. While she certainly had the right to be angry, and Americans absolutely have the right to criticize him (he was wrong, but itdidn affect his ability to run the country), to say that she is a weak person for staying with him is absolute bullsh*t.Clinton strength is in her ability to forgive, to think of the bigger picture, to make her marriage work in spite of a very, very public affair. Of course, this is the sort of thinking that can be expected from a guy who was Mayor when the planes hit the twin towers on September 11, 2001, yet recently completely forgot about those attacks while he was criticizing President Obama, who paraded his mistress around for all to see, and who told the media he was divorcing his wife before he informed her or their children. ?Under those eight years, before Obama came along, wedidn have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack inside the United States,? Giuliani said in a speech in youngstown, Ohio earlier last month. ?They all started when Clinton and Obama got into office.?

"A Donald Trump supporter in Bellingham, Washington delivered a shocking rebuke to an obvious Hillary Clinton fan that may have jolted some sense into her ? literally. When local police failed to respond to RayGilbride complaints that someone was removing Trumpsigns from his front yard, he decided to take matters into his own hands ? and not merely because the culprit was interfering with his constitutional right to express his political opinion. ?The fact is, stealing is stealing.I getting a lot of that criticism, too, people sayingit just a sign. Why do we prosecute kids for stealing just a candy bar? Situational ethics is wrong. Stealing is stealing.You got to go back to the basics. Ifit not yoursdon touch it.? And itwasn just theft ? whoever was removing the Trumpsigns was trespassing onGilbride property. So, after talking to police about his legal options to protect his property ? the front yard and the signs ? Gilbride rigged up a trip-wire and hooked it up to a non-lethal electric charge that would deliver a surprise to the Clinton-supporting thief the next time she made a late night raid. ?It would have been different if somebody hooked it to a 110 (volt) outlet and watched somebody get hurt,? said Gilbride, adding that a pulsating charge similar to that used in invisible pet fencesdoesn do any lasting damage. Sure enough, the surveillance camera caught the image of the unsuspecting woman running ontoGilbride yard in the middle of the night, making her way to the now-electrified Trumpsign. ?She just stopped, just a dead stop,? Gilbride told local news reporters. The woman, who remains unidentified, eventually regained her senses, according to the laughing homeowner, and was able to make off with the signs, anyway. Presumably shewouldn be quite as in favor of this form of supporting a candidate if it was Gilbride sneaking onto her yard in the middle of the night to steal ?I?m With Her? signs.

Joe Dunford, the top U.S. military official, weighed in Tuesday with a letter, obtained by POLITICO, outlining his concerns for U.S. service members and ?risks to the close security cooperation relationships? with allies. And Defense Secretary Ash Carter fired off another warning to Congress, arguing that legislation has ?potentially harmful consequences for the Department of Defense and its personnel.? ""While we are sympathetic to the intent of JASTA, its potential second- and third-order consequences could be devastating to the department and its service members and could undermine our important counterterrorism efforts abroad,"" Carter wrote in the letter, obtained by POLITICO. On Tuesday,McCain Democratic counterpart on the Armed Services Committee, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, acknowledged the administration's concerns. ?I?m looking closely at two significant issues,? Reed said. ?One is that the families are looking not for any type of award,they looking for accountability as much as anything else. On the other side, is the real possibility this will be used against us and our troops and servicemen, andI trying to balance that.?McCain Democratic opponent, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, also plans to vote to overrideObama veto, she said in a statement earlier this month.Kirkpatrick campaign has also raised Saudi Arabia as a campaign issue. As the Senate debated a vote to block a Saudi arms sale last week, her campaign accused McCain of having ties to the Saudi government through a donation to the McCain Institute. Even lawmakers who have voiced concerns say there is little question the Senate is set to easily overrideObama veto. Corker and Graham had started to discuss a potential change to the legislation that would narrow its scope to just the families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, according to congressional sources. Right now, JASTA applies to any foreign government found liable for terrorism conducted on U.S. soil ? although the main target of the legislation has largely been viewed as Saudi Arabia and its alleged role in the terror attacks 15 years ago. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals. Speaking with reporters, Corker said limiting JASTA to just Sept. 11 victims was the easiestway to narrow the legislation, but it was still facing opposition from JASTA supporters. He predicted that lawmakers may push to pass a legislative fix to the 9/11 bill in the lame-duck session, after observing any potential blowbackthe United States ends up facing from foreign governments over the next several weeks. ?Thisisn to me about Saudi Arabia,? Corker said. ?It?s the blowback to us becausewe the most involved in the world. You end up exporting your foreign policy to trial lawyers, right? ? Whatyou really doing here is potentially exporting big issues to trial lawyers away from our own abilities as a government to conduct foreign policy.That an issue.? Though the veto override appears like a done deal, there was a clear and palpable sense ofbuyer remorse percolating among key lawmakers as the Senate barreled toward the key vote on Wednesday. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that he himself was a co-sponsor of JASTA. Still, thatwasn stopping him from having second thoughts as the prospect of the legislation turning into law became a reality. ?I?m worried about getting into a tremendous legal morass that can really cost this country, not just locally but by other countries across the world,? Hatch said. ?I have to say, Idon think we had enough time to consider all the ramifications. There are a lot of ramifications.? Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, also reiterated her concerns: ?The more I think from an intelligence perspective,it the wrong thing to do.? Still, other senators appeared to have little change of heart ahead of the high-profile vote on Wednesday. ?The vote passed overwhelmingly here in the Senate and the House,? said Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.). ?I supported it at the time. Ihaven seen anything that would change my mind.?",0.029891304,0.004076087,0.004076087,0.014945652,0.042119565,0.24320652199999998,0.005434783,2,-1,1
"As a fifth-generation Rockefeller, I was raised on the practical standards of what used to be known as Rockefeller Republicanism and later, Reagan Republicanism. One of the guiding principles of this political philosophy was to reach across the aisle to make progress on issues that would best serve the American people. We were above all a problem-solving party that was fiscally disciplined, fully accountable, less inflexible on social issues, and willing to compromise in order to get things done.I sad to say that the commonsensical ?party of the people,? of which I was once proud to be a member, no longer exists. But thatdoesn mean itcan exist again. Indeed, ironically enough, DonaldTrump rapacious presidential campaign has done so much to destroy the soul of the Republican Party that he might be just the thing that allows us to reinvent it altogether, and along lines that will appeal to millennials and beyond. Story Continued Below True, for now, the rise of this very un-Republican, doomsday-is-here candidate has driven many of us who remained in theparty I like to think of as the reasonable, forward-thinkingRepublicans. Some used to call us moderates; I prefer the term pragmatists. Now,we either drank the Trump Kool-Aid, are hiding in embarrassment, are just sitting this one out or have reluctantly joined the other side. Our best hope of avoiding extinction isTrump resounding defeat, a definitive sign that the Republican Party must evolve and change. But we should look on the positive side of this disaster. Trump is like an amateurish hackerwho implanted a virus that has exposed theparty outdated operatingsystem too-narrow ideology. Now we can start from the ground up again, and to install this critical update, we need the startup attitude and energy of our digital generation. My hope is that some Rockefeller Republican code will be a part of this transformation, rebooting a legacy of pragmatism and public service. At least that is whatI working on now. Millennials now number 83.1 million, the largest demographic in the United States and equal in voting power to baby boomers. So, instead of directing my own philanthropy into the wasteland of campaign finance,I seeking to get young Americans working on solutions.That whyI supported a national college program that brings together diverse groups of socially minded Republicans, Democrats and independents, to converse, brainstorm and resolve problems based on issues, rather than affiliations. The raw material is plainly there, among the younger generation, to restore the Republican Party to its rightful place as the Party of Reason. Millennials value integrity over intransigence, action over rhetoric and equality over elitism. A poll by the Harvard Institute of Politics noted that among potential voters age 18 to 29 what is valued most in a candidate is integrity, level-headedness and authenticity. According to a Pew report, a majority of young Republicans say immigrants strengthen America, corporate profits are too high, and stricter environmental laws are worth the cost. And among the one-third of millennials who affiliate with or lean Republican, just 31 percent have a mix of political values that are right-of-center, whereas 51 percent take a mix of liberal and conservative positions and 18 percent have consistently or mostly liberal views. Trump is like an amateurish hackerwho implanted a virus that has exposed theparty outdated operating system.? To move toward a more purposeful party platform, here are a few proposals that place sound policy before partisanship. While increasing border security (without building a nonsensical wall), create a system where undocumented immigrants can work towards legal status, not citizenship. Acknowledge the dangers of climate change and promote a 20-30 year transitional path from fossil fuels to alternative energy sources, which includes a revenue neutral carbon tax. Close the gun-show loophole and expand the market for smart handguns that can only be used by their owners. Form a bipartisan commission on tax reform that will require two ironclad criteria: revenue neutrality and the guarantee that recommendations would receive only an up-or-down vote preventing riders and amendments. In addition, to keep the swarms of lobbyists at bay, members of the House and Senate would have to wait a minimum of three years before becoming a consultant or lobbyist. The ideaisn to go back in time and turn Republicanism into a kind of Norman Rockwell painting.We talking about the evolution of a new paradigm where some of the valued principles of the party are encoded with a state-of-the-art brand of logical thinking that addresses reality and gets government working again. *** I come to practical politics from a very personal perspective. At 19, I was in a horrific car crash and lost my right leg above the knee and the use of my right arm. This life crisis reframed everything, and I had to learn to look at challenges and obstacles through the simple prism of ?either this is going to work or itisn.? Over time, my politics shifted, as well. Instead of caring about what was more conservative or more liberal, my focus turned towhat doable and efficient. When he lost the Republican presidential nomination to Barry Goldwater in 1964, my great-uncle, Nelson Rockefeller, became one of the first victims of the extremistelement rise in the party. During the campaign, he accused Goldwater of being out of touch with reality, which sounds disturbingly relevant today. My uncle, Jay Rockefeller, the only Democrat in the family to serve in public office, retired last year after 30 years in the Senate. While reliably liberal, he was always more concerned with policy than politics. He mourned the loss of a system where reasonable negotiation and collaborative deal making were mutually agreed upon standards. Hence my hope for the future of the party rests largely on the next generation of reasonable Republican leaders. Like many of those who identify as Republicans,I not a RINO(Republican In Name Only), but rather someone seeking to update essential but dying traditions from the inside of a party that is on the verge of falling apart. When I became eligible to vote in 1979, I was proud to be a Reagan Republican. Now, younger GOP supporters, whoaren aligned with theparty platform or want no part of a Trump candidacy, have no place to turn. As part of our college project, I sent out a request for opinions and feedback ontoday party platform. One note that was particularly moving was from a 25-year-old gay man named John, who preferred to remain anonymous. ?I have found it very difficult to support the Republican Party, with the attractive free-market ideals clouded in divisive rhetoric and obstructionist tactics,? he wrote. ?As a gay person, I have also been repelled by the Party's socially conservative agenda. If the Republican Party wants to survive and gain the support of my generation, it needs to become the party of Reason. My generation is largely nonreligious, supportive of our diverse citizens (including race, sexual orientation, etc.) and solution focused. I hope Republican leaders will consider this going forward. Now is the perfect time to reinvent the Party.? It is indeedtime will be after November8 the rubble left behind by the Trump candidacy. The way to do that will be to remind ourselves what the party once stood for and what it was built on. If Ronald Reagan were talking to disheartened millennials today,that exactly what he would say:We the party that freed the slaves, the party of inclusion, the party of immigration. The harsh truth is Reaganwouldn even qualify as a Republicantoday he would call out a demagogue like Donald Trump as a perilous threat to traditional conservative tenets. Moreover, Reagan brought a sense of optimism and hope to a nation that had been worn down and divided and made people proud to be Americans again.Trump apocalyptic prophecies are anathema to the confidence and positivity Reagan inspired in us. There must be a sea change in the GOP definition of visionary leadership. We need to encourage millennials who identify with the party of Lincoln to start running for school boards, city councils and state legislatures, as well as develop online communities and databases. And to elect Republican representatives, senators and governors who reflect their values and stands on issues. This is where the next great Republican leaders and president will come from. Idon approve of some of President BarackObama policies, but I agree 100 percent when he says, ?democracyisn a spectator sport.? For me,it time to be investing in GOP 2.0.

"Concerns about New York and New Jersey bombing suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami's intentions were raised to authorities by his father and a neighbor more than once over the past years, ABC News has learned. Interested in New York? Add New York as an interest to stay up to date on the latest New York news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Two years ago, Rahami's father told the FBI that his son was interacting with ""bad people"" overseas and a concerned citizen in the neighborhood told authorities that Rahami's associates may have been trying to procure explosives, sources told ABC News. The FBI first became aware of Rahami in the summer of 2014, when local law enforcement contacted the agency's New Jersey field office about him, sources said. A dispute at the Rahami home had brought local law enforcement to the house at that time. A neighbor told the authorities he overheard Rahami's father calling his son a ""terrorist,"" according to a U.S. official. In addition, the neighbor saidRahami father had expressed concern his son may be in contact with people overseas who were collecting explosives, ABC news was told. The FBI then opened a so-called ""Guardian"" file on Rahami, initiating a process to determine whether Rahami had any links to terrorism or other criminal activity and whether a more formal investigation was warranted. The assessment of Rahami produced no clear evidence or indications of radicalization, and at one point his father recanted his claims, sources said. Rahami was not placed on any U.S. terrorism watch lists. Speaking to reporters today outside of his New Jersey home, Rahami's father said he ""called the FBI two years ago"" about his son. ""I told them you got a connection with this guy,"" he said, without offering any further information. The FBI interviewedRahami father after New Jersey officials compiled complaints and sent them a suspicious activity report. He told the FBI that his son had traveled to Pakistan and was interacting with ""bad people,"" according to sources. Rahami's father also told the FBI his son had injured and beaten members of his immediate family -- but a grand jury declined to file charges against him. However, Rahami's father later told the FBI he didn't mean to suggest his son was a terrorist, but that he was hanging out with ""undesirables,"" the U.S. official said. At a press conference Monday, the head of the FBI's field office in New York, Bill Sweeney, noted that the FBI had previously received ""a report of a domestic incident,"" adding that ""the allegations [were] recanted."" However, Sweeney did not address terrorism-related allegations.It unclear if the FBI or other law enforcement agencies interviewed Rahami in 2014. As in most suspicious activity report cases they review, the FBI found no significant derogatory information in Rahami's case, sources told ABC News. In a statement today, the FBI acknowledged that in August 2014 they ""initiated an assessment of Ahmad Rahami based upon comments made by his father after a domestic dispute that were subsequently reported to authorities."" ""The FBI conducted internal database reviews, interagency checks, and multiple interviews -- none of which revealed ties to terrorism,"" the statement said. One source emphasized that only a single report came to authorities related to Rahami. Had more reports come in, authorities would have looked further at him, the source said, adding that the FBI does not have the resources to put every subject of a suspicious activity report under full-time surveillance. ""We should not be keeping people under surveillance indefinitely"" when there is no solid reason, another U.S. official said, adding that doing so would violate Constitutional rights. ""Our job together is to find those needles in a hay stack,"" FBI Director James Comey recently told lawmakers. ""In fact, our job is harder than that, it's to find pieces of hay in that haystack that may become a needle and disrupt them before they move from consuming to acting on that [online] poisonous propaganda."" TheFBI ability to assess potential terrorists came under intense scrutiny after Florida native Omar Mateen opened fire inOrlando Pulse nightclub in June, killing 49 people and injuring scores more. In May 2013 the FBI had obtained sufficient information to open a preliminary investigation into Mateen ? coworkers told authorities that Mateen had made terrorism-related comments at work. But after ten months of investigation, including two interviews with Mateen, the FBI determined therewasn enough information to indicate he was ""possibly a terrorist,"" as FBI Director James Comey put it after the Orlando attack. Two months later, in July 2014, the FBI took another look at Mateen because his name ""surfaced"" in a separate terrorism investigation, Comey told reporters. Mateen was interviewed again, but authorities found no reason to continue tracking him.",0.034710744,0.004958678,0.003305785,0.016528926,0.09256198300000001,0.256198347,0.014876033,2,-1,1

Washington (CNN) Hopes by Donald Trump's campaign that it can mobilize enough white voters to win in November is a case of self-delusion, according to GOP pollster Whit Ayres. ""That's a wonderful example of how we can delude ourselves into thinking that nothing really has to change,"" Ayres recently told CNN's ""Party People"" podcast hosts Kevin Madden and Mary Katherine Ham.

""So if every single one of them had turned out and voted for Mitt Romney, he still would have lost.

"Trump Meets Netanyahu ? Vows Jerusalem Will Be Recognized asIsrael Capital CNN had an ominous headline today (it?s showing on google but they changed it on the story): Trump, Netanyahu meet for nearly 90 minutes.It like a BIG DEAL to CNN that Netanyaho met with Trump longer than Clinton saying that ?Her meeting with the prime minister was somewhat shorter than his talk Sunday morning with Trump. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Hillary Clinton Sunday night at a New York hotel, after conferring earlier in the day with Donald Trump for nearly 90 minutes at Trump Tower?. So why do you think Netanyahu met longer with Trump than Hillary? Well Hillary has been the Secretary of State during an unprecedented time where the UnitedState devotion to Israel has waned dramatically. Under Hillary as Secretary of State, the U.S. has given over $100 billion to the terrorist regime in Iran whom Obama supports over Israel. This is what leaders look like. The meetings between Netanyahu and Trump and Hillary materialized over 24 hours on Friday.Trump aid made a phone call to one of the primeminister advisers. Once it was clear that a meeting was going to happen,Netanyahu office contactedClinton campaign to hold a meeting with her as well, to keep the balance. The PrimeMinister senior official explained that, ?The primeminister instruction was clear ? if we meet with one side, we must also meet with the other side. We are following the number of meetings to make sure that one sidedoesn get more meetings than the other.? The Trump campaign statement said during the meeting, ?Trump agreed that the military assistance provided to Israel and missile defense cooperation with Israel are an excellent investment for America,? amid the backdrop of speculation that Trump would support cutting U.S. military aid to Israel. Trump told Netanyahu that if elected, ?there will be extraordinary strategic, technological, military and intelligence cooperation between the two countries.? Trump added that Israel is a ?vital partner of the United States in the global war against radical Islamic terrorism.? The two also discussed the nuclear deal with Iran and the fight against ISIS. ? 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

"Monday night was Donald Trump's introduction to the general-election debate stage. On display was the Republican presidential nominee as a dichotomy; there was the, albeit briefly, measured Trump who forwent his usual ?Crooked Hillary? for ?Secretary Clinton? as he addressed his Democratic rival. And, defying expectations, he did not address her husband's marital indiscretions, later saying he abstained out of respect for Chelsea Clinton, who was in the room. In his second form, the businessman displayed his usual bombast and penchant for attacks, showcasing style perhaps over substance. Interested in Donald Trump? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Members of his campaign team were trying to lower debate expectations of Trump, leaking to reporters that he was shunning policy briefings and not standing at faux lecterns for 90 minutes at a time in preparation. They instead praised his freewheeling style and confidence and criticized Hillary Clinton for being overly prepared. ""I thought my prep was very good. I think my prep was very good. And I really enjoyed it,"" Trump told ABC News' Tom Llamas last night. Trump, while forceful in his attacks, appeared to miss key opportunities to contrast himself with his opponent. During the 90-minute debate, Trump never mentioned the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, even after Clinton invoked Libya and his comments about her private email server were sparse. Such attacks on key issues are typically practiced during debate prep sessions; according to his advisers, Trump never participated in a mock debate. During a phone interview this morning on ""Fox & Friends,"" the hosts asked Trump if he had any regrets about his performance. ""Do you regret not bringing up the emails as much? You brought it up at one point,"" host Ainsley Earhardt asked. She followed up by asking why he did not expand his attacks on Clinton's email server or the Clinton Foundation. ""I would have liked to have done that,"" Trump responded. ""But the question weren't ? I mean, don't forget you are asked a question as to progress or something, and it's hard to get off to Benghazi sometimes the way the questions were framed. You know, you start off open a totally ? the opposite of Benghazi, and so Benghazi can't get brought up, but it was a very interesting evening. I thought it was good."" He landed blistering attacks on Clinton on trade, one of his signature issues, effectively highlighting her weaknesses in supporting, then denouncing the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But he seemed to falter when questioned about his past actions. When asked what took him so long to accept the fact that President Barack Obama was born in the country, Trump reverted to the lie that the Clinton campaign pushed the birther issue before the Democratic primaries eight years ago. Trump's answer to the question caused some voters to lower their approval rating of him, according to a focus group hosted by veteran pollster Frank Luntz. ""I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job,"" Trump said during the debate. In another misstep, he admitted during a heated exchange with Clinton on tax returns that he did not pay federal taxes. ""Maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes,"" Clinton said. ""Because the only years that anybody has ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax."" ""That makes me smart,"" he retorted. But Trump, ever the showman, delivered several quick-witted exchanges that elicited laughter from the audience. ""Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, yes, is that OK?"" he asked, looking her for approval. As she nodded, he added, ""Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.""",0.032989691,0.012371133999999999,0.010309278,0.0041237109999999995,0.07628866,0.28865979399999997,0.0,2,-1,1

" The New York Times has announced that law enforcement have captured the man wanted in connection to thisweekend improvised explosive detonation in Chelsea, which injured 29. After a lengthy firefight which left one police officer with non-life threatening wounds, Ahmad Khan Rahami was taken into custody in Linden, New Jersey. The police said there was conclusiveevidence that Rahami was connected to several other devices that had failed to detonate. They were able to identify him from photos on a cellphone that had been used as a detonator but did not explode. Rahami is a naturalized citizen, born in Afghanistan in 1988. It is unclear whether or not he was a refugee or when he came to the United States. He lived in Elizabeth, NJ, where his family operated a fried chicken restaurant. Regulars at the First American Fried Chicken resturaunt described Mr. Rahami as ?friendly,? noting that he dressed in Western clothing and was obsessed with ?fast cars.? There are no connections as of yet to the any international terror or any indication of religious radicalization. While Republican nominee Donald Trump will surely use this as an excuse to double down on his anti-Muslim and anti-refugee platform, it should be noted that thanks to the vigilance of American citizens and the rapid response of law enforcement, there have been no deaths from the bombings and the suspect was captured extremely quickly. No change of our already lengthy vetting process would have prevented Mr. Rahami from entering the country; the parts of the IEDs are purchasable at any hardware store. We cannot allow the right-wing to use this as an evidence that their discriminatory isolationism would protect us better ? because itwon.

"A Louisiana deputy city marshal is in hot water after body cam footage revealed him shooting at a suspect who had his hands up in the air. This is, sadly, becoming too common a story in the news as awareness of problems with officers who have hair-trigger fingers grows. What makes this story sadly and horrifically unique, though, is that Deputy Derrick Stafford also shot and killed thesuspect six-year old son. And Stafford is claiming self-defense for that, because of course he is: ?Stafford, out of fear for his life and that of his fellow officers, began shooting at the vehicle to prevent any further actions by [Christopher] Few which would put the officers in imminent danger.? Officers went after Christopher Few after watching an argument between him and his girlfriend outside a bar just before the 2015 shooting. They claimed witnessing domestic abuse as the reason they decided to chase down Few, whose six-year old son, Jeremy, was in the front passenger seat. 18 rounds were fired although Few had his hands up, but no firearm was found in the car, and Few and Jeremy were both shot while still in the car. Stafford and his partner, Norris Greenhouse, said that after Few drove forward and then backed up, they were in fear for their lives, so they fired.That always the story, though. It makes us wonder just what police departments are teaching that so many officers shoot first and ask questions later, claiming they were in fear for their lives whenit obvious that their suspects were unarmed, and even had their hands in the air. Reports claim that neither Stafford nor Greenhouse knew Jeremy was in the car when they opened fire. Few was critically wounded, and Jeremy, who was autistic, non-verbal and in a special-needs first-grade class, was murdered.Stafford plea of ?self-defense? is a huge middle finger to Few and the rest ofJeremy grieving family.

"As the presidential campaign enters its home stretch, CNN's Steve Holmes will be scrutinizing political claims that ignore the facts with a reality check. (CNN) It was early Sunday morning when many Americans were having their breakfasts that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union"" with Jake Tapper -- serving up two whoppers. The issue was how long Donald Trump continued to ask whether President Barack Obama was born in the United States even after Obama produced his long-form birth certificate birth certificate in 2011. That document showed Obama was born in Hawaii. In the interview, Christie stretched the truth beyond recognition two times within 30 seconds, a kind of double Salchow of prevarication. First, his assertion that the so-called birther issue was first raised by the Clinton campaign. ""It was a contentious issue,"" Christie told Tapper, ""and, by the way, an issue that Patti Solis Doyle of the Clinton campaign in 2008 has recently admitted that it was an issue that Mrs. Clinton also injected into her campaign in 2008 in a very quiet, but direct way against then-Sen. Obama."" Really? Solis Doyle said that? Actually, here's what she said to CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""The campaign, nor Hillary, did not start the birther movement. Period. End of the story. There was a volunteer coordinator, I believe in late 2007, I think in December. One of our volunteer coordinators in one of the counties in Iowa, I don't recall whether they were an actual a paid staffer, but they did forward an email that promoted the conspiracy."" ""The birther conspiracy?"" Blitzer asked. ""Yeah. Hillary made the decision immediately to let that person go. We let that person go, and it was so, you know, beyond the pale, Wolf, and you know, so not worthy the kind of campaign that certainly Hillary wanted to run or that we as a staff wanted to run that I called David Plouffe, who was obviously managing Barack Obama's campaign in '07, to apologize and basically say this is not coming from us."" Funny, Solis Doyle's admission sure sounds an awful lot like a denial and there is no evidence that then-Sen. Clinton interjected this into her campaign in any way. Shortly thereafter, Christie took issue with Tapper for saying that Trump stayed on the birther issue for five years after Obama released his long-form birth certificate in April 2011. ""It's just not true that he kept it up for five years,"" Christie said to Tapper. ""It's simply not true. It wasn't like he was talking about it on a regular basis until then, and when the issue was raised he made very clear the other day what his position is."" Here is what CNN reported on what Trump said and did after the long-form birth certificate was released: -- ""He didn't know he was running for president, so he told the truth. The literary agent wrote down what he said ... He said he was born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia ... Now they're saying it was a mistake. Just like his Kenyan grandmother said he was born in Kenya, and she pointed down the road to the hospital, and after people started screaming at her, she said, 'Oh, I mean Hawaii.' Give me a break."" May 24, 2012, interview with The Daily Beast's Lloyd Grove, responding to an erroneous report about Obama -- ""A lot of people do not think it was an authentic certificate. ... Many people do not think it was authentic. His mother was not in the hospital. There are many other things that came out. And frankly if you would report it accurately I think you'd probably get better ratings than you're getting."" May 29, 2012, to CNN's Wolf Blitzer -- An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud. Follow Donald J. Trump ? @realDonaldTrump 4:23 PM - 6 Aug 2012 9,792 9,792 Retweets 6,844 6,844 likes -- a tweet more than a year after Obama released his long-form birth certificate. -- ""Was it a birth certificate? You tell me. Some people say that was not his birth certificate. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't. I'm saying I don't know. Nobody knows."" August 2013 to ABC News - ""How amazing, the State Health Director who verified copies of Obama's 'birth certificate' died in plane crash today. All others lived."" Follow Donald J. Trump ? @realDonaldTrump 4:32 PM - 12 Dec 2013 5,796 5,796 Retweets 3,709 3,709 likes -- in a tweet about the death of Loretta Fuddy. -- ""Well, I don't know -- did he do it? ... Well, a lot of people don't agree with you and a lot of people feel it wasn't a proper certificate."" May 2014, in an interview with TV3's Colette Fitzpatrick in Ireland, Trump first contested whether Obama had released his birth certificate, then questioned its legitimacy. -- ""There are three things that could happen. And one of them did happen. He was perhaps born in Kenya. Very simple, OK? He was perhaps born in this country. But said he was born in Kenya because if you say you were born in Kenya, you got aid and you got into colleges. People were doing that. So perhaps he was born in this country, and that has a very big chance. Or, you know, who knows?"" May 27, 2014, in remarks at the National Press Club -- ""Who knows about Obama? ... Who knows, who knows? Who cares right now?... I have my own theory on Obama. Someday I will write a book, I will do another book, and it will do very successfully."" January 6, 2016, in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer Sure sounds like Christie is wrong when he says that Trump is not keeping the issue alive.

"North Carolina Republicans are lamenting the unrest gripping theirstate largest city, but, quietly, they also see it as an opportunity for Donald Trump to gain ground in a critical swing state. Andthey asking him to take advantage of it. Story Continued Below ?North Carolina Republicans are sending the word to the Trump campaign that once this settles down, a visit to Charlotte, to the Mecklenburg police, to the sheriff and others, is something we really want to see,? said a high-ranking North Carolina Republican, granted anonymity to discuss political calculations during a sensitive moment for the state. ?Lawmakers and party officials are sending word to the Trump campaign.? The crisis in Charlotte was sparked by the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, an African-American man who police say was armed, though no video has been released and the family disputes that claim. Since then, the city has been the scene of violent clashes between police and protesters, with the clashes captured on live, national television. The tumult comes as HillaryClinton once-formidable lead in state polls has faded. A spate of polls out this week show either a tied race or give Trump a slightedge sharp contrast from last month, when Clinton was leading by anywhere from 2 to 9 percentage points. North Carolina political operatives are skeptical that, unless the chaos in Charlotte continues for weeks, the issue will make a substantial dent in the race. But Republicans and some Democrats do say that the dynamic creates an opening for Trump to further shore up and energize the GOPbase he has struggled todo voters will respond to hiscampaign law-and-order message and his staunch defense of police, even amid national concerns over institutional police racism. A senior adviser to the Trump campaign said only that Trump had been in the state earlier this week and ""we have not yet announced the date of our next trip back to the state."" ?I certainly think unrest feeds intoTrump narrative that ?America?s falling apart, we need to make America great again,?? said Tom Jensen, a Democratic pollster whose firm is based in North Carolina. ?My sense is, most white North Carolinians who would be really repulsed bywhat going on in Charlotte would be inTrump camp. I doubt it moves the needle a lot, but the race is just about tied ? something like that is never going to move the race by 3 or 4 points, but it can change the race on the margins, andwe on the margins.? Thus far, Clinton has largely stuck to tweeting in support of Scott, rather than commenting on the Wednesday night protests. And Trump was vague in a Fox News appearance Thursday morning, lamenting the ?lack of spirit between the white and the black,? and going on to assert that amid the chaos ?our country looks bad to the world? in a speech later in the day. But moving the needle even a little may be enough in a state where the polls are tight andthere a history of thin margins. North Carolina, a typically red state that went for Barack Obama in 2008 before swinging back to support Mitt Romney in 2012, is central toTrump path to victory, which is narrower thanClinton is.Clinton summer leads in the state were fueled by support from African-American and college-educated voters in a state that is home to the Research Triangle, the Raleigh-Durham area where universities and high-tech companies are based. But in North Carolina, as in a number of other swing states, her lead has diminished amid scrutiny of her email practices, her health and her overall commitment to transparency. And the protests, Republicans say, may mean more trouble, especially if there are additional nights of strife. ?Every time there is a riot, protest, or general disruption of civility it helps Donald Trump,? said Chris Wilson, a Republican pollster who was the director of data, analytics and digital strategy on TedCruz primary campaign. The Cruz primary campaign had firsthand experience with this: Protests at a Chicago Trump rally ahead of the March 15primaries a list of states that included North Carolinavoted the weekend coverage before those races. Wilson said the net effect was boosting Trump across the board in the final days before the Republican contests (though representatives from Sen. Marco Rubio's campaign, also watching their own internal numbers, have said theydidn see the same effect). ?We certainly saw this in the primaries as the riots [in] Chicago, prior to a scheduled Trump speech, created a significant lift forTrump candidacy,? Wilson said. ?Not just in Illinois, but also in Missouri and North Carolina.? The unrest also carries risks for Trump, as the charged racial questions surrounding the issue heighten the possibility of a misstatement, one that could undo a recent effort to fight charges thathe a racist candidate. That is a risk for the bombastic Trump, who has a record of horrifying moderate voters in the wake of tragedies (?Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism,? he tweeted, following a shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, though he said hedidn want the ?congrats?). And the Charlotte situation carries opportunities for Clinton as well. African-Americans, a crucial part of her base, have been outraged by the shooting, the latest instance of a black man dying in an altercation with police (in this instance, the police officer involved was also African-American). Clinton has been a champion of ?Mothers of the Movement,? a group of African-American mothers whose children died primarily in incidents involving law enforcement, and she is a vocal proponent of criminal justice reform. In North Carolina and nationally, her campaign is engaged in extensive outreach to the African-American community. A senior Democratic operative working in North Carolina said the incidents unfolding in Charlotte underscore the risks African-Americans see in a potential President Trump. ?It is further alienation, a further concern among African-American voters aboutTrump presidency,? the source said, noting that Trump has a long record of making incendiary comments about minorities. The strategist saidTrump best-case scenario, politically, is that calls for law and order help him solidify hisbase thatdoesn move the dial with independent and more moderate voters, the source insisted. ?I think Donald Trump continues to solidify his 43 percent of the vote,he not adding votes,he certainly alienating others,? the Democrat said, going on to add, ?It just confirms to his base all the thingsthey concerned about are real. But shoring up 43 percent of the vote you have is not the way to get to 50.? And Carter Wrenn, a longtime Republican strategist, said it is not a given thatTrump standing will rise on the other side of the aisle just because of the protests. ?Ifyou living in North Carolina, you turn on the TV andthere riots in Charlotte,there looting, it gets your attention, but itdoesn automatically help one candidate over another,? he said. ?It depends on how the individual candidate responds. People will watch that. If they think, ?Gosh,Trump got a lot of judgment, he knows how to solve this,' it will help him. If they think, ?Old Trump just poured gas on the fire,? itwon help him at all.?",0.045774648,0.007042254,0.003521127,0.01056338,0.072769953,0.302816901,0.01056338,2,-1,1

"Donald Trump spent Monday night making a total ass out of himself in the first presidential debate. We were all waiting to see just what would happen tonight, and it was quite the spectacle. From lies to self-incrimination, watching the GOPnominee performance was the equivalent of one facepalm after another. So here you go, a complete list of every batshit crazy thing that came out of DonaldTrump mouth during the first presidential debate: ?There?s nobody in our government to fight them [China], and we have a very good fight, and we have a winning fight.? ?They?re using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China and many other countries are doing the same thing.? ?We have to stop these countries from stealing our companies.? ?Ourcountry in deep trouble. Wedon know whatwe doing with devaluations? Especially when it comes to China,they the best.They the best ever at it. Whatthey doing to us is a very very sad thing.? ?That?s called business, by the way.? (referring to making money off of the 2007 financial collapse) ?I?m a great believer in all forms of energy? Our country is losing a so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.? ?I will bring back jobs. Youcan bring back jobs.? ?That?s about allyou got.?

You are going to drive businesses out.? ?I?m going to cut taxes, big-league. You are going to raise taxes, big-league.? ?And take a look at mine also.? (referring to his campaign website) ?She tells us how to fight ISIS on her website. Idon think Douglas MacArthur would like that too much?You telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonderyou been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.? ?Well,I really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going to create tremendous jobs.They going to expand their companies.They going to do a tremendous job.? (hahahaha) ?I?m getting rid of the carried interest provision, and if you really look,it really not a great thing for the wealthy,it really a great thing for middle class.? (methinks thou dost protest too much) ?These people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies. And whenthey going to bring 2.5 trillion dollars back from overseas, where theycan bring the money back because politicians like Secretary Clintonwon allow them to bring the money back because the taxes are so onerous and the bureaucratic red tape is so bad.? (or because those companies are greedy and un-American, just saying) ?So, whatthey doing is leaving our country, and believe it or not,they leaving our country because the taxes are too high. Because some of them companies have lots of money outside our country, and instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work because theycan work out a deal. And everybody agrees it should be brought back, instead of thatthey leaving our country to get their money because theycan bring their money back into our country, because of bureacratic red tape. Because theycan get together, because we have a President thatcan sit them around a table, and get them to approve something.? (maybe companies should just pay their taxes so wedon need to cut valuable public services) ?We have no leadership, and honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton? Why not [blame Clinton for everything]?? ?We?re in a bubble right now, and the only thing that looks good is the stock market.? ?We have a FED that is doing political things? the FED is being more political than Secretary Clinton? ?When we have a countrythat doing so badly,that being ripped off by every single country in the world,it the kind of thinking that our country needs.? ?We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.?

(referring to not paying people who worked for him) ?But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people thatdidn get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.

And we need law and order. If wedon have it,we not going to have a country.? ?Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.? ?We have to be ? we have to know whatwe doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.? ?No,you wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places whereit allowed.? (referring to racial profiling becoming outlawed as unconstitutional) ?We need law and order. And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected bywhat happening are African-American and Hispanic people.

These are very, very good people.? ?But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if theyshouldn be on there,we help them,we help them legally,we help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.? ?But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.? ?They?ve been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, becausethat what it is.They controlled these communities for up to 100 years.? ?You know,you seen me,I been all over the place. You decided to stay home, andthat OK. But I will tell you,I been all over. AndI met some of the greatest peopleI ever meet within these communities.? ?When I got involved, Ididn fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. SoI satisfied with it. AndI tell you whyI satisfied with it? But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job? Well, it was very ? I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing.? ?But let me just tell you. When you talk about healing, I think thatI developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community. I think you can see that. And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion? ?And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.? ?First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. Itdoesn work that way. You were after him.? ?Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into myfather company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country ? it was a federal lawsuit ? were sued. We settled the suit with zero ? with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do.? ?And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which Idon do on you. MaybeI trying to save the money.? ?But, frankly, I look ? I look at that, and I say,isn that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, andit just one of those things.? ?I?ll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. Andit a tremendously successful club. AndI so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. AndI very, very proud of it. Andthat the way I feel. That is the true way I feel.? ?In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE.They never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE.? ?As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhapswe not. Idon think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.She saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but Idon ? maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?? ?Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, wedon know, because the truth is, under President Obamawe lost control of things that we used to have control over.? ?We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet,they beating us at our own game. ISIS.? ?So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is ? it is a huge problem. I have a son.He 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers,it unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybeit hardly doable.? ?But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. Butthat true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better? and certainly cyber is one of them.? ?So she talks about taking them out.She been doing it a long time.She been trying to take them out for a long time. But theywouldn have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then youwouldn have had them.? (speaking about the creation of ISIS) ?Or, asI been saying for a long time, and I thinkyou agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil ? and we should have taken the oil ? ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil ? a lot of the oil in Libya.? WrongWrong. Wrong.? ?The secretary said very strongly about working with ?we been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest messanyone ever seen.? ?But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal,that another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And nowthey going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the waythey going.? ?Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of themaren paying their fair share. Number two ? and that bothers me, because we should be asking ?we defending them, and they should at least be paying us whatthey supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.? ?And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because ? and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest ? but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times.? ?And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I thinkthat great. And I think we should get ? because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.It a lot of money to protect other people. ButI all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also. Andthey going to do that. And that was ? believe me ?I sureI not going to get credit for it ? but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.? ?And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. Theycouldn believe it. They sat back probably and said, Ican believe it.? ?But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Nowit in over 30 countries. Andyou going to stop them? Idon think so.? ?That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she ? frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.? ?Well, I have much better judgment than she does.There no question about that. I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?? ?I have a much better ? she spent ? let me tell you ? she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising ? you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names ? oh, temperament,let go after ? I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not have a?? ?Wait. The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, Idon know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control. I said,there a person with a temperamentthat got a problem.? ?Wrong?It lies? Thatline getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like to?It not an accurate one at all.It not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of things ? and just to respond.? ?I agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your ? your president thinks. Nuclear is the single greatest threat.? ?Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us. But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service andwe losing a fortune.That whywe losing ?we losing ? we lose on everything. I say, who makes these ? we lose on everything.? ?All I said, thatit very possible that if theydon pay a fair share, because thisisn 40 years ago where we could do whatwe doing. Wecan defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million.? ?All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out.We a country that owes $20 trillion. They have to help us out.? ?Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia,she very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their ? they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint.? ?We are not ? we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike.? ?I think that once the nuclear alternative happens,it over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. Ican take anything off the table.? ?Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea,we doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.? ?Whydidn you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash.Nobody ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way. So you say to yourself, whydidn they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.? ?Andthey going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me,he not a happy camper.? ?But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place. Right now,it getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, becausethey in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.? ?And shedoesn say that, becauseshe got no business ability. We need heart. We need a lot of things. But you have to have some basic ability. And sadly, shedoesn have that.? ?All you have to do is speak to them. Wait. You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and Idon believe that Hillary has the stamina.? ?The world ? let me tell you. Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, butit bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the last ? soshe got experience, that I agree. Butit bad, bad experience.? ?I never said that? Ididn say that? Where did you find this?? Oh, really?? ?You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some ofit said in entertainment. Some ofit said ? somebodywho been very vicious to me, RosieO, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.? ?But you want to know the truth? I was going to say something? extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, ?Ican do it. I justcan do it.It inappropriate.It not nice.? Wow. In hindsight, it would have probably been easier to list the things Trump said thatweren completely and utterly ridiculous. When it finally came time to face off with Hillary Clinton on the debate stage, Trump failed miserably and totally embarrassed himself. As Hillary said Monday night, Donald ?lives in his own reality,? presumably a reality where he thinks he actually makes sense.

"Share Tweet Email address: Leave this field empty if you're human: Scott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert cartoon, wrote a blog post about switching his endorsement from Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump, andit a great read. Adams was ready to help make Herstory until Hillary proposed her most recent tax plan, which includes raising estate taxes, which Adams views (correctly) as ?robbery by government.? In case youhadn heard, Hillary wants to force people with a net worth of over $500 million to give the government SIXTY-FIVE PERCENT of their riches. Well over half, you guys. And worse, as Adams points out, the actual plan would result in increased taxes on lower value estates too. And these estate taxes would be ON TOP OF the income taxes that have already been paid. Adams paints the picture: In my case, a dollar I earn today will be taxed at about 50% by various government entities, collectively. WithClinton plan, my remaining 50 cents will be taxed again at 50% when I die. So the government would take 75% of my earnings from now on.There a good reason Adams opposes the estate tax, andthere a good reason you should too: I oppose the estate tax because I was born to modest means and worked 7-days a week for most of my life to be in my current position. (I?m working today, Sunday, as per usual.) And Idon want to give 75% of my earnings to the government. (Would you?) How does anyone defend such a proposition?It theft, plain and simple. As you might expect from a hilarious cartoonist, Adams also gives snarky reasonshe switching his vote. Like this one: It seems to me that Trump supporters are planning for theworld biggest party on election night whereas Clinton supporters seem to be preparing for a funeral. I want to be invited to the event thatdoesn involve crying and moving to Canada. Adams explainsTrump strategy in a way that evenTrump top strategists should be taking note of, becauseit perfect: Trump always takes the extreme position on matters of safety and security for the country, even if those positions are unconstitutional, impractical, evil, or something that the military would refuse to do. Normal people see this as a dangerous situation. Trained persuaders like me see this as something called pacing and leading. Trump pacesthe public ? meaning he matches them in their emotional state, and then some. He does that with his extreme responses on immigration, fighting ISIS, stop-and-frisk, etc. Once Trump has established himself as the biggest bad-ass on the topic, he is free to ?lead,? which we see him do by softening his deportation stand, limiting his stop-and-frisk comment to Chicago, reversing his first answer on penalties for abortion, and so on. If you are not trained in persuasion, Trump look scary. If you understand pacing and leading, you might see him as the safest candidate who has ever gotten this close to the presidency.That how I see him. Adams attributesTrump suitability for the role of president to his persuasive personality: Most of the job of president is persuasion. Presidentsdon need to understand policy minutia. They need to listen to experts and then help sell the best expert solutions to the public. Trump sells better than anyone you have ever seen, even if youhaven personally bought into him yet. Youcan deny his persuasion talents that have gotten him this far. No. You reallycan deny his persuasion talents. 41 more days,y. 41 more days.",0.014388488999999999,0.016786571,0.002398082,0.016786571,0.045563549,0.316546763,0.002398082,2,-1,1

"?We love you, buddy, but what are you here for, if youcan answer basic questions?? Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, was destroyed on Morning Joe Wednesday morning because he tried to tap-dance around the most basic questions about hiscandidate stands on issues. Things started to go downhill about two and a half minutes into the interview when Willie Geist asked Mook if Clinton had regrets about the way Syria was handled. Completely ignoring the question,Mook response was that Hillary left the State Dept. with a 70% approval rating. GEIST:What her biggest regret about the waySyria been handled? MOOK: Well, obviously,she been out of office for some time now. GEIST: But she was there when it started. MOOK: Well, right, but, but, uh, you know, she, I, I thinkshe well regarded for her leadership as secretary of state. She came out of that office with a 70 percent approval rating. In contrast to Donald Trump, she has released a clear and decisive plan to defeat ISIS. Donald Trump has said that he thinks he knows more about it than the generals and refuses to tell us what his secret plan is. GEIST: I understand, Robby. What about in Syria, though? She supported the drawing of the red line. Obviously, she was out of office when Assad used chemical weapons. Was it a mistake to draw the red line if the president was not willing to go ? to do something about it when it was crossed? MOOK: Well, as you pointed out, the decision regarding that was made after she was out of office, so I thinkyou have to ask President Obama ?

" Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are still hours away from squaring off in the first debate of the 2016 race, but the pre-debate spin between each campaign is already well underway. Here's a glimpse at the expectations game waged by campaign surrogates who made the television rounds Monday morning. Trump 'can't hide' - Clinton running mate Tim Kaine at a rally Monday ""The thing about 90 minutes is boy, you can't hide. Now Donald Trump likes to say, you know, 'I'm going to build this wall, then I'm not taking any questions,' but okay, when you've got 90 minutes and there's just a moderator and two of you on stage, you can run but you can't hide."" Moderators on notice - Trump running mate Mike Pence on Hugh Hewitt's radio show ""My confident hope in the debate tonight and our debate and the other two presidential debates (is that) the moderators will ask the questions and they'll allow the candidates to answer the questions. And the rest of you people afterwards can do all the commentating and let the American people decide."" Fact-checker - Clinton campaign press secretary Brian Fallon on CNN's ""New Day"" ""There is enough lies that Donald Trump tells consistently that everyone should be able to call him out -- (debate moderator) Lester Holt, Hillary Clinton will, too. But I think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching, that are grading the candidates' performances should take it into account."" He'll 'be himself' - Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller on CNN's ""New Day"" ""Mr. Trump is going to be very prepared for this evening, but the key point to make about Mr. Trump is that he's going to go in there with the clarity and conviction of a candidate who knows exactly what his vision is, exactly how he wants to help the country. And so he's going to go in there and essentially be himself. And that's something that's really easy to prepare for. Secretary Clinton has a much bigger challenge, she's trying to program all of her lines and figure out what poll-tested methods are going to work tonight."" Just the facts - Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, appearing on NBC's ""Today"" show: ""All that we're asking from Donald Trump is that he stick with the facts, that he give clear plans and that he have a command of the issues. That's how we think the candidates should be judged. ""That's how they've been judged in the past. What we don't want to have is some kind of double standard where Donald Trump can get the most improved award but Hillary Clinton is getting judged on the fine points of policy."" Lowering expectations - Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, appearing on NBC's ""Today"" show ""Robby and I are living in parallel universes. Donald Trump has been criticized all weekend long. I think that the Clinton campaign has clearly been talking to the media for a week now saying it's your job to make sure that Donald Trump is checked -- fact-checked in real time. I'm just surprised the campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate. ""Look, they know that campaign debates are not Hillary Clinton's sweet spot. Yes, she is experienced at doing them but the experience hasn't necessarily been beneficial. I've been asking voters formally, can you name anything from a debate that you've seen from Hillary Clinton that really moves you or that you remember and they can't. She's been in 34 of them."" 14 Season finales of ""The Apprentice"" - Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus on CNN's ""WOLF"" ""He's studying and he's preparing and they're going through hypotheticals and what scenarios might come up. But he's very comfortable, he did a great job in our primary debates. He's also been through 14 season finales, he will be prepared."" Season finales are ""showmanship"" - Mook responds to Priebus on CNN's ""WOLF"" ""You asked him about Donald Trump's qualifications in his approach tonight and he stressed he's had 14 season finales of the Apprentice, and I think they really are hoping to coast on style and his television showmanship."" Watch the women - Clinton supporter Rep. Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat, appearing on CNN's ""New Day"" ""Remember, Donald Trump has never gone one-on-one in a debate with anyone, much less a woman. So I think there's huge risk if he goes after her in that fashion that a lot of in particular women will say, 'holy smokes that's out of bounds.'"" Trump is unpredictable - Trump supporter Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican, appearing on CNN's ""New Day."" ""I'm confident he will adapt and say what he has to say or protect his style. Ted Cruz is different than Hillary Clinton and he sort of adapted his attacks to each opponent. I think you'll see a line of argument and attack, if you will, that is different. Again, we have to wait and see because I don't think anyone can predict what Donald Trump will do, but I think he will do very well.""",0.045234249000000004,0.009693053,0.006462036,0.009693053,0.06946688200000001,0.253634895,0.001615509,2,-1,1

"New Audio Evidence Revealed In The Case OfJonBen Ramsey That May Point To The Killer The JonBenet Ramsey case has plagued America for 20 years, now. Who would want to murder such a beautiful young girl? What would their motive be? How could they have pulled it off in a way that would stump law enforcement for two decades? In the last month, stories about the case, including a CBS special, A&E documentary and a Dr. Phil interview with thegirl brother, have come to the forefront. Have we finally evolved enough technologically speaking that we can now determine who murdered little JonBenet Ramsey? The biggest break in this case was the audio picked up by the 911 dispatcher afterJonBenet mother, Patsy Ramsey, tried to hang up the phone. At the time this occurred, technology was just not good enough to determine who was speaking or what they said. Now, however, the audio could be slowed down and we can finally hear this potentially critical piece of audio. Keep in mind as you read this thatJonBenet father John Ramsey was and perhaps still is considered a suspect in hisdaughter murder.

On top of that, it also sounds like, what specialists believe to be a small child, possibly nine-year-old Burke Ramsey, saying, ?What did you find?? After this point, a female voice can be heard saying, ?We?ve called the police, now what?? Additionally, the ransom note was determined to have taken approximately 21 minutes to write according to investigators and is said to have contained several lines from the movies Dirty Harry and Speed. Another odd coincidence was the fact that the ransom demanded was about equal to the amount that John Ramsey was given as a bonus that year. Perhaps the most bizarre finding of all was the ?maternal language? that linguistics experts say was noted in the letter. Not only this, but the misspellings that were included in the letter appeared to have been placed there on purpose, so suspicion would point to a person for whom English is not their native language.

"Trump  says he opposed the Iraq War. That's still false. ?Donald supported the invasion of Iraq? ? Clinton ?Wrong.? ? Trump Trump was supportive of the Iraq invasion as far back as 2002, according to interviews the Donald did with Howard Stern, which were first uncovered by BuzzFeed. Stern asks Trump if he agreed with the Bush administration trying to sell the war. He said, ?Yeah, I guess so.? The argument between Clinton and Trump then spilled over into a clash of words between Trump and moderator Lester Holt. Holt insisted Trump had supported the war, referencing the Stern interview. Trump then claimed he'd had arguments with Fox News televsion host Sean Hannity, in which he argued against the war. He also said the argument that he supported the war was a media ""lie."" He also cited a 2004 Esquire interview that mentioned his criticism of the Iraq invasion as proof of his opposition. That interview took place after the start of the war, and Esquire has since attached a note to the article arguing that Trump is misrepresenting its contents.",0.0546875,0.0078125,0.0,0.015625,0.140625,0.375,0.0,2,-1,1
"Rep. Robert Pittenger said Charlotte protesters ""hate white people because white people are successful andthey not."" | Getty North Carolina lawmaker: Charlotte protesters 'hate white people' North Carolina GOP Rep. Robert Pittenger said protesters in Charlotte are motivated by racism rather than anger over the fatal police shooting of Keith Scott, an African-American man. ""The grievance in their mind is the animus, the anger,"" Pittenger said during an interview with the BBC. ""They hate white people because white people are successful and they're not."" Story Continued Below Pittenger -- who is under investigation by the FBI and IRS over his ties to his former real-estate firm -- insisted that the ""welfare state"" has turned American citizens into slaves. ""We have spent trillions of dollars on welfare, where we put people in bondage so they can't be all that they're capable of being,"" Pittenger added. ""America is a country of opportunity, of freedom, of liberty. It didn't become that way because of a great government that provided everything for everyone."" When asked later about the comments, Pittenger's office sent a statement apologizing for the incident. ?What is taking place in my hometown right now breaks my heart,"" Pittenger said in a statement. ""My anguish led me to respond to areporter question in a way that I regret. The answerdoesn reflect who I am. I was quoting statements made by angry protestors last night on national TV. My intent was to discuss the lack of economic mobility for African-Americans because of failed policies. I apologize to those I offended and hope we can bring peace and calm to Charlotte.? Scott's death has triggered several days of rioting in Charlotte. Republican Gov. Pat McCrory has declared a state of emergency and the National Guard has been called in to assist local police. Charlotte police officials have refused to release a videotape of Scott's shooting, calling it not ""definitive.""

"It was only a matter of time before the military would start reeducating servicemen (or is it ?servicepeople??) about how to behave around others who are born with one set of sex organs but identifyas a member of the opposite sex. All troops will be required to be trained in how to behave around transgender people by July of 2017, coinciding with the date that the Navy will begin accepting transgender recruits. Military.com reported: In an all-Navy message published Tuesday, Chief of Naval Personnel Vice Adm. Robert Burke said a three-pronged training approach will equip senior leaders and rank-and-file personnel for the changes. ?This training will emphasize policies and expectations of personal behavior,? the message states. Beginning Nov. 1, mobile training teams composed of Navy fleet representatives and subject matter expects will be dispatched to deliver face-to-face briefs to senior leaders, including commanding officers, executive officers, command master chiefs, and chiefs of boat. These sessions will also be open to equal opportunity advisers, ombudsmen and other command-designated representatives who will have a role in training the tenant commands on policies governing transgender troops. [?] Along with permitting transgender troops to serve openly, the military is creating procedures for troops to change their ?gender marker? in the administrative Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, and laying out rules to govern how troops might undergo medical gender transitions while in uniform. Transgender troops will be required to use the bathroom and berthing facilities associated with their preferred gender, Navy officials have said. And service leaders will be on alert for those who seek to single out or mistreat their transgender counterparts. The Military Times reported that transgender troops are now eligible to receive sex-reassignment surgery paid for by the Pentagon (taxpayers) as long asthey active-duty, and there is approval from their doctors and military health officials. The surgical procedure to rearrange the active duty militarymember genitals to vaguely resemble those of the opposite sex can be performed at a military hospital, or ifit not available at the time ? or ifthere a long wait time ?

" Just one point separates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in two states that are critical to both candidates' chances of becoming president, according to new CNN/ORC polls in Pennsylvania and Colorado . In Colorado, likely voters break 42% for Trump, 41% for Clinton, 13% for Libertarian Gary Johnson and 3% for Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Pennsylvania's likely voters split 45% for Clinton, 44% for Trump, 6% for Johnson and 3% for Stein. Those divides are well within each poll's 3.5-point margin of sampling error. The new results in two battleground states underscore the closeness of the race and come as the candidates prepare to square off Monday night in their high-stakes first debate at Long Island's Hofstra University. In both states, sharp divisions among whites by education are evident, with white college graduates choosing Clinton over Trump by 11 points in Pennsylvania and 16 points in Colorado, while whites who do not hold four-year degrees break in Trump's favor by 19 points in Pennsylvania and 22 points in Colorado. In Colorado, that education gap is a bigger divide than gender or age, and is even larger than the racial gap in the state. Pennsylvania's likely voters are more divided than Colorado's along gender and racial lines. Johnson's appeal among younger voters appears to be working to Clinton's detriment in both states. While Trump's numbers are significantly lower among voters under 45 than among older voters, Clinton's are roughly the same across age groups, while Johnson's support multiplies among younger voters. Clinton fares better in two-way matchups in both states, topping Trump 50% to 47% among likely voters in Pennsylvania and 49% to 47% in Colorado. Though both results are within the polls' margin of sampling error, the finding suggests she could fare better in each state if third party candidate support dipped. The two polls come alongside tight national polls and neck-and-neck poll results in several other key battleground states including Ohio, Florida, Nevada and North Carolina. In both Colorado and Pennsylvania, the economy stands out as far and away the top voter concern. About half of registered voters in each state, and a similar share of likely voters, call the economy most important out of a list also including terrorism, illegal immigration and foreign policy. And when asked which candidate would better handle the economy, Trump comes out on top in both states, though within each poll's margin of error. JUST WATCHED Can GOP turn Pennsylvania red in 2016? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Can GOP turn Pennsylvania red in 2016? 03:42 Clinton holds broad advantages for handling foreign policy in both states, and she tops Trump by 8 points on handling immigration in Colorado, a state where a Pew Research Center analysis recently estimated that about a quarter of the state's sizable Latino population is foreign born. In Pennsylvania, the two candidates run about even on that issue. And in the wake of terror attacks in New York and New Jersey, voters in both states are about evenly split on who would better handle terrorism. The poll suggests Clinton has made an effective case that Trump does not have the temperament to be president -- she is viewed as better suited for the presidency by a nearly two-to-one margin in each state on that score -- and she holds smaller advantages as the better candidate to be commander-in-chief. But Clinton continues to lag behind Trump when voters are asked which of the two is more honest and trustworthy. Trump's contention that Clinton lacks the stamina for the job splits voters in Colorado, 48% see him as having the better stamina, 45% choose Clinton. In Pennsylvania, Trump holds a larger advantage on that, 50% to 45%. Democrats have a narrow edge in the race for Pennsylvania's U.S. Senate seat, with Katie McGinty topping incumbent Pat Toomey 49% to 46% among likely voters, just inside the poll's margin of error, and a broad lead in Colorado's Senate contest, with incumbent Michael Bennet up 53% to 43% over Republican challenger Darryl Glenn. The CNN/ORC Polls in Colorado and Pennsylvania were conducted by telephone Sept. 20-25. The Colorado poll included interviews with 1,010 adult residents of the state, including 784 who are likely to vote in November. In Pennsylvania, interviews were conducted with 1,032 adult residents of the state, including 771 likely voters.

"A video capturing the moments leading up to and following the fatal police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, which has sparked days of protests across the city of Charlotte, was released by theman family today. Interested in Keith Lamont Scott? Add Keith Lamont Scott as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Keith Lamont Scott news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest A woman identified as Scott's wife, Rakeyia Scott, recorded the incident with her cellphone. The footage was provided to ABC News by attorneys for the Scott family today. In the cellphone video, an SUV is seen parked in the street as police repeatedly yell at Scott to ""drop the gun."" Scott's wife, who is standing several feet away from the scene, pleads with the officers not to harm her husband. ""Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him,"" she says. ""He has no weapon. He has no weapon."" Police continue to scream at Keith Lamont Scott: ""Drop the gun! Drop the f---ing gun!"" Rakeyia Scott yells back at police, insisting her husband is harmless and doesn't have a gun. ""He doesn't have a gun,"" she says. ""He has a T.B.I. [traumatic brain injury]. He's not going to do anything to you guys. He just took his medicine."" One officer can be heard saying, ""Let me get a f---ing baton over here."" Rakeyia Scott then yells to her husband anxiously, ""Keith, don't let them break the windows. Come out the car!"" Police order Keith Lamont Scott to ""drop the gun"" several more times as his wife screams, ""Keith! Keith! Don't you do it!"" That's when multiple gunshots ring out. The actual shooting is not shown on the video as Rakeyia Scott points her cellphone at the ground and screams, ""Did you shoot him?"" She then runs closer to the scene, angling the cellphone camera again at the spot where her husband was shot. ?He better not be f---ing dead. He better not be f---ing dead,? she yells at police. ?He better live. I swear, he better live.? Scott's body is seen lying in the street surrounded by several officers. ""Did you all call an ambulance?"" Scott's wife asks, before the video cuts out. According to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, Scott was treated immediately and later pronounced dead. The video is the first footage of Scott's encounter with police to be publicly released. Investigators have not released the dashboard and body camera videos. The footage is ""not great"" for investigative purposes because you don't see the officers and you don't know whom Scott's wife is speaking to or what she is referring to when she says, ""Don't do it,"" said former FBI Special Agent In-Charge Rich Frankel. ""You need a lot of information before you can make an informed decision,"" Frankel told ABC News. ""You have a lot of people putting out their opinions on what happened. Until you more information, it's all hyperbole and guesses."" One of the attorneys representing the Scott family, Charles G. Monnett, said they released the video ""in the name of truth and transparency."" ""The family is still hopeful that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department and city of Charlotte will release all available video of the incident to the public so that people can draw their own conclusions about Keith's death,"" Monnett said. ""We encourage everyone to reserve judgment until all the facts are known. This is simply one step in our quest to find the truth for this family."" Police say Scott was holding a handgun, which investigators recovered from an apartment complex in Charlotte, and posed a threat because he was not obeying police orders to remain in his vehicle and drop the weapon. An officer subsequently fired his gun, striking Scott. Police have identified that officer as Brentley Vinson, who has been employed with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department since July 21, 2014, and is currently assigned to the metro division. He has been placed on paid administrative leave as the investigation continues. Vinson was not wearing a body camera at the time, but the other officers who responded to the incident were, police said.Scott family has said he was not armed and was holding a book while waiting for his son to be dropped off from school. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said the video evidence alone does not establish probable cause. But the ""intent"" is to publicly release the video along with other supporting evidence once it's been fully gathered. Still, the timing has to be right, he said. The probe into Scott's death has now been officially handed over to North Carolina's State Bureau of Investigation, which will be in charge of providing updates and releasing further information on the status of the investigation, according to Putney.

He just came out and spoke on the Charlotte riots and it was exactly what I expected? lame and in support of violent radicals.

Is the right way killing police officers across the nation? What a reprehensible statement and by the way, the exact opposite of what he said over the Baltimore riots.

From Breitbart: President Barack Obama dismissed the recent violence and destruction in Charlotte, North Carolina by rioters reacting to the shooting of an armed African-American man by an African-American police officer. ?The overwhelming majority of people who have been concerned about police-community relations [are] doing it the right way,?

Add Syria as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Syria news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest The convoy was delivering wheat flour, health supplies and other emergency aid to some 75,000 people in Urum al-Kubra in rural Aleppo, according to the U.N. Of the 31 trucks in the convoy, at least 18 were hit. A Syrian Red Crescent warehouse was also destroyed and a health clinic severely damaged, the U.N. said. About 20 civilians and one SARC staff member were killed as they were unloading the trucks, according to a joint statement from the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. ""The convoys that we had hoped to move across the border to Syria as well as aid inside Syria have been temporarily put on hold. As a result, millions of people across Syria run a very real risk of not receiving the assistance they need because of this callous attack,"" David Swanson, a spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told ABC News. He noted that all parties to the conflict were notified about the convoy and that it was marked with aid signs. ""Obviously, we are absolutely outraged that such an attack can take place,"" he said. The U.N.'s aid coordinator said the attack on the aid convoy could amount to a war crime. ""Let me be clear: If this callous attack is found to be a deliberate targeting of humanitarians, it would amount to a war crime. I call for an immediate, impartial and independent investigation into this deadly incident,"" StephenO, the U.N.'s undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, said in a statement after the attack. The Red Crescent in Aleppo confirmed in a statement that Omar Barakat, SARC's director in Urum al-Kubra, was among those killed. Yousef Houran, a lawyer and activist in Syria, said he witnessed aid trucks burning after the attack in Urum al-Kubra. ""Bodies of Red Crescent volunteers are still burning inside the cars and no one can get close to them because of repeated airstrikes on the same spot,"" he told ABC News last night following the attack.

These trucks will remain parked until the U.N. re-evaluates the situation on the ground. Today, the four besieged towns of Madaya, Zabadani, Foua and Kefraya were supposed to receive humanitarian assistance, but the U.N. has also put these deliveries on hold indefinitely.

""It's brutal what is going on right now and there has to be accountability for what happened last night. This is not the first time that we have seen aid being attacked in Syria.

After yesterday's attack on the aid convoy, the U.S. Department of State released a statement yesterday saying it would now reconsider the prospect of cooperating with Russia. ""The United States is outraged by reports that a humanitarian aid convoy was bombed near Aleppo today,"" the statement read. ""For more than a week, we have urged Moscow to fulfill the commitments it made in Geneva to facilitate the unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid to the Syrian people. And for more than a week, the Syrian regime repeatedly denied entry to these U.N. convoys, preventing them from delivering urgent food, water and medical supplies to desperate Syrian citizens. Only today did the regime finally grant permits for some convoys to proceed. The destination of this convoy was known to the Syrian regime and the Russian federation and yet these aid workers were killed in their attempt to provide relief to the Syrian people.

And I'm confident that over the next month we will see a sharpening, if you will, of the differences of the arguments between the candidates."" But Kerry declined to weigh in on specifics of the tight race between Hillary Clinton, his predecessor at Foggy Bottom, and Republican nominee Donald Trump. In the interview Kerry was also sharply critical of Russia for failing to enforce a ceasefire agreement in Syria, calling on Russia to ""stop the grandstanding, stop the showboating and get the humanitarian assistance going."" Kerry's comments come as convoys carrying humanitarian aid are blocked from reaching some of Syria's hardest-hit areas. ""It is now Sunday morning. This started Monday night of last week -- this past week. And the humanitarian assistance is supposed to be flowing,"" Kerry said. He pinned the blame on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is at war with insurgents. The United States and Russia are split on who they back in the Syrian civil war, but are attempting to work together to combat terror groups in the country. Kerry complained that Assad's government is blocking the aid and has continued the violence, and said Russia must pressure Assad. ""The regime, once again, is blocking it. So Russia's client, Russia's supported friend, is the single biggest blockade to the ability to move forward here,"" Kerry said. ""So let me just say this clearly: Russia signed up to a cessation of hostilities. Assad said he would live by it. Then he needs to stop and let the joint implementation center get set up so Russia and the United States can coordinate in order to avoid the kind of terrible thing that happened yesterday that we all acknowledge and regret,"" Kerry said. His comments come the day after the US-led coalition fighting ISIS admitted it struck Syrian forces rather than a terror target. Kerry also issued a broader call for Russia to pressure Assad. ""The biggest judgment they need to make is to stop Assad from bombing people indiscriminately, which he continues to do,"" the secretary of state said. ""And if you are serious about having a ceasefire, and they say they are, then they should keep Assad from flying right now and prove their sincerity about a ceasefire,"" he said. ""But to allow Assad -- who is a spoiler; he doesn't want a ceasefire -- to allow him to continue to go after opposition, pretending that they are Nusra, is in and of itself a huge challenge to this effort."" Kerry said ""there are no good options"" to stop the crisis in Syria, and that the options that do exist are ""ugly."" ""One option is trying to move toward a ceasefire and trying to get to the table to have a negotiation. But the other option moves to more arms in the area, more fighting, more destruction, more migrants, more refugees. More children, women, schools, hospitals hit. Literally, possibly the destruction of Syria as an entire nation and state. And it is getting close to that even now,"" Kerry said. ""So the options are not pretty. But you've got to put to test the seriousness of purpose of a nation."" He acknowledged that Defense Secretary Ash Carter and others at the Pentagon have expressed reservations about a ceasefire agreement and in trusting Russia to help enforce it. ""Nothing in this agreement is based on trust,"" he said. ""It is based on very specific steps that each side has to take. And that includes pulling back from this key access road in the north near Aleppo. It includes restraining both sides, Assad, and for us, the opposition, from engaging. And then it includes the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and delivering a real cessation of hostilities."" Kerry also weighed in on the explosion Saturday night in New York City, saying ""the security in the city of New York will be unparalleled as it always is"" in the wake of the incident. ""I'm not concerned about that. But I think we need to be concerned for every American and for the folks in New York on a day-to-day basis. Understand what's going on. The teams are doing that and as I said, they could not be more qualified or capable,"" he said.",0.046367852,0.00618238,0.021638331,0.00618238,0.06336939700000001,0.261205564,0.004636785,2,-1,1

"AP Photo McConnell, Pelosi, Ryan seek deal on government funding impasse A total of $170 million for the Flint water crisis is added to the WRDA bill. Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi are trying to hash out an agreement to break an impasse over government funding as the Sept. 30 budget deadline fast approaches. In a series of three-way discussions on Tuesday night, the trio of party leaders were forging a compromise to extend government funding until Dec. 9. In turn, Republicans would provide an ""iron-clad commitment"" that funding to address the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, will be included in the Water Resources Development Act, which covers hundreds of federal water projects. Story Continued Below Late Tuesday, congressional leaders made headway on at least one part of the multi-layered discussions: Pelosi and Ryan agreed to incorporate an amendment to the sweeping waters legislation that would add about $170 million in federal aid for Flint. ""The amendment represents a bipartisan agreement between Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi to allow germane authorization language to be added to WRDA as an amendment that will, at the end of the day, provide the necessary funding Flint needs in the final WRDA conference report,"" a Pelosi aide said late Tuesday night. The water resources legislation could head to the House floor as early as Wednesday. Pelosi and other Democrats had refused to support any continuing resolution, or a CR, to keep the government open without the Flint funding. Ryan, for his part, faced problems rounding up GOP votes for a short-term funding bill. With Ryan and Pelosi holding direct talks, a deal was expected soon to break the impasse. McConnell and Pelosi had also held discussions on the Flint-WRDA issue, said GOP and Democratic sources. McConnell had been pushing to include Flint funding in the WRDA package. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) had been making his own insistence for Flint aid clear with Republicans. Earlier, Senate Republicans had been considering stripping Louisiana disaster aid money from the stalled stopgap spending bill, which in theory could have resolved Senate Democratic objections to the legislation and ultimately stave off a government shutdown at the end of the week. That proposal had come after Democrats voted Tuesday to reject the stopgap spending measure ? which would keep the government open until Dec. 9 ? because the package provides money for Louisiana and other states but did nothing to address Flint. McConnell had been expected to unveil a revised legislative text with no Louisiana disaster relief, one senior GOP leadership aide said, but any formal action will now wait until Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican floated the idea at a news conference Tuesday shortly before the procedural vote failed 45-55, far short of the 60-vote threshold. ""We keep hearing that their position is no Flint, no floods,"" McConnell said. ""That's certainly an option worth discussing."" Informed of that comment, Reid told reporters he wanted to see exactly what McConnell would do, and again said Democrats wanted relief for both Louisiana and Flint. But other Democrats suggested the move would pave the way to a resolution. ""If Louisiana were not in there, it would reduce the profile of disaster aid in this bill. And that would be helpful,? said Senate Minority Whip Richard Durbin. ?There's still really deep felt feelings by our Michigan senators and many others that this is just fundamentally unfair to the victims in Flint and we don't trust the House to help at all,? Durbin added. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer also said Democrats wanted assistance for victims in both communities, but that they would likely back a so-called continuing resolution that included aid for neither. ?I doubt that we would turn that down,? he told reporters. Hoyer said Democrats would insist the legislation still contain $1.1 billion to combat the Zika virus, which has long been stalled on Capitol Hill. The measure also includes popular provisions to fund veterans programs and implement a July law to curb prescription opioid addiction. Senate Republicans had argued that the proper place for Flint aid is water infrastructure bill moving through Congress. The Senate passed the Water Resources Development Act, which includes $220 million for Flint and other communities with failing infrastructure, on a 95-3 vote earlier this month. ?Why do you feel as if you have to punish people in Louisiana who are digging out from a flood ? sounds kind of crazy, but they have mud in their home they have to dig out ? for Flint whenthere a pathway forward on Flint through the WRDA bill?? argued GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy, who has repeatedly pressed the need for flood aid for his home state of Louisiana. Still, despite vows from some Senate Republicans that Flint aid will be included in any final bill negotiated by the House and Senate in a lame duck session, Democrats had been skeptical. Meanwhile, Democrats also objected to language in the stopgap bill that continues a prohibition on the Securities and ExchangeCommission ability to require corporate disclosure of political spending. But that provision has been a secondary issue to the fight over Flint. McConnell and Reid each accused the other of bringing the federal government to the brink of a shutdown, but few think such a politically-damaging scenario would take place just weeks before the presidential election. If the Senate is able to pass a funding bill, the House would be expected to follow suit relatively quickly. Among the 45 votes in favor of the bill were four Democrats, including those representing conservative leaning states, like Jon Tester of Montana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, as well as Bill Nelson of Florida, where the Zika virus is spreading quickly. Thirteen Republicans joined most Democrats in voting against the bill, including conservatives Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, and SouthCarolina Lindsey Graham. Cruz led a failed fight to include language blocking the Obama administration from relinquishing oversight of the Internet domain system to an international body. Graham promised to oppose the bill because it would not lift financing restrictions on the Export-Import Bank.

"Clinton warns against getting 'distracted' by Trump's terror talk Hillary Clinton on Monday urged Americans not to get ?diverted and distracted? by Donald Trump's inflammatory words as the United States combats the threat posed by the Islamic State. ?Let?s not get diverted and distracted by the kind of campaign rhetoric we hear coming from the other side. This is a serious challenge,? Clinton told reporters after delivering a statement from White Plains, New York. ?We are well equipped to meet it. And we can do so in keeping with smart law enforcement, good intelligence and in concert with our values.? Story Continued Below Clinton addressed the recent string of attacks in New York, New Jersey and Minnesota on Monday, remarking that the terrorist threat of the Islamic State is real while also casting herself as the only candidate with the experience necessary to handle such threats. ?This threat is real but so is our resolve. Americans will not cower. We will prevail. We will defend our country and defeat the evil, twisted ideology of the terrorists,"" said Clinton, who implicitly contrasted her role as head of the State Department andTrump inexperience in politics and government as she declared, ""I?m the only candidate in this race who has been part of the hard decisions to take terrorists off the battlefield.? Clinton also presented herself as a longtime advocate of ?tough vetting? and called for an improved visa system. Her response Monday contradictedTrump message. While the Republican presidential nominee seemingly encouraged racial profiling to help law enforcement stop future attacks during a phone interview with ?Fox and Friends,? Clinton talked up her bona fides. ?I was part of the national security team that worked with President Obama, developed strategies to fight the terrorists ? sometimes that involved direct kinetic action, sometimes that involved working with allies and partners, sometimes that involved capture,? she said. ?Iwon get into classified information, but I have sat at that table in the Situation Room, I have analyzed the threats, I have contributed to actions that have neutralized our enemies. I know how to do this and I understand how wedon want this to get even bigger than it already is.? As forTrump contributions to the terrorism conversation, Clinton cited his rhetoric as ammunition for the other side. ?We know that DonaldTrump comments have been used online for recruitment of terrorists,? she said. ?We?ve heard that from former CIA Director Michael Hayden, who made it a very clear point when he said Donald Trump is being used as a recruiting sergeant in and for the terrorists. We know from the former head of the Counterterrorism Center, Mike Olsen, that the language that Mr. Trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries.? Trump on Monday again criticized President Barack Obama and Clinton for refusing to go after ?radical Islamic terrorism.? But Clinton brushed off the real estatemogul criticism of her record. ?Well,it like so much else he says:It not grounded in fact.It meant to, you know, make some kind of demagogic point,? Clinton said. ?And the facts are pretty clear that, you know, we still have challenges.That what I have been talking about throughout this campaign. I am prepared to, ready to actually take on those challenges, not engage in a lot of, you know, irresponsible, reckless rhetoric, but to do the hard work asI done before, to put into place the strategies for local and state law enforcement for an intelligence surge, for the kind of preventive actions we need to take here at home and to intensify our efforts to defeat ISIS.? Clinton suggested Americanswon hear heropponent plan, and not because it's secret. ?He keeps saying he has a secret plan. Well, the secret is he has no plan,? she said. ?Solet focus on what we really can do, and what I've laid out is a path forward that will keep us safer, protect our country and go after the terrorists to finally destroy them.?",0.040685225,0.012847966,0.019271949,0.002141328,0.064239829,0.336188437,0.032119914,2,-1,1

" Donald Trump Jr., the candidate's eldest child, emerged early on as one of his father's most ferocious advocates and polished surrogates. But the shine is coming off after a series of damaging missteps -- the latest coming when he likened Syrian refugees to Skittles candy. Trump Jr.'s lightly filtered Twitter account has at times appeared to be a clearinghouse for particularly unsavory media and commentary. On Tuesday, for instance, he retweeted a Breitbart story titled, ""Europe's Rape Epidemic: Western Women Will Be Sacrificed At The Altar Of Mass Migration."" Here are a few the son's latest stumbles: Compared Syrian refugees to Skittles ""If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem."" At least, that's how Donald Jr., among others , would describe it. This image says it all.

Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) September 19, 2016 While many Trump supporters offered their support, the tweet provoked a broader backlash. Mars Candy eventually chimed in to distance themselves from the message. ""Skittles are candy; refugees are people,"" the company said in a statement. ""It's an inappropriate analogy. We respectfully refrain from further comment, as that could be misinterpreted as marketing."" JUST WATCHED Donald Trump Jr. compares Syrian refugees to Skittles Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Donald Trump Jr. compares Syrian refugees to Skittles 01:00 The moral question aside, Washington Post reporter Philip Bump pointed out a math problem. According to a recent Cato Institute report , the odds ""that an American would be killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee was 1 in 3.64 billion a year."" As Bump explains, the tweet could -- with the framing only slightly altered -- be interpreted as an argument for letting in more refugees. Still, the campaign insists Trump Jr. has been ""a tremendous asset"" all the way through. ""Speaking the truth might upset those who would rather be politically correct than safe,"" Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller told CNN in an email. ""But the American people want a change, and only Donald Trump will do what's needed to protect us."" Gave a new reason why Trump hasn't shared his taxes Donald Trump is on track to be the first modern presidential candidate withhold his tax information. The candidate and the campaign have for months said their reason for keeping a lid on the returns was an ongoing audit. But in an interview last week with the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review , Trump Jr. gave a very different explanation. The decision was made, he said, because Trump has ""got a 12,000-page tax return that would create ... financial auditors out of every person in the country,"" and have them ""asking questions that would distract from (his father's) main message."" While there is no law preventing Trump from making the returns public, audit or not, Trump Jr.'s comment reflected what critics have been saying for months: that this is and always has been a political calculation. 'Gas chamber' reference Complaining about media coverage is part of almost every campaign's playbook. References to ""the gas chamber"" are not. During an interview with Philadelphia-based conservative talk radio host Chris Stigall, he first described the press as the Clinton campaign's ""number one surrogate."" But then, this: ""They've let her slide on every indiscrepancy (sic), on every lie, on every DNC game trying to get Bernie Sanders out of the thing. I mean, if Republicans were doing that, they'd be warming up the gas chamber right now. It's a very different system -- there's nothing fair about it."" The campaign denied that Trump Jr. was making a Holocaust reference -- the Nazis used gas chambers as a tool of their World War II-era genocide -- and that the comment, a bit of hyperbole, was really about capital punishment more generally. ""The liberal, dishonest media is so quick to attack one of the Trumps that they never let the truth get in the way of a good smear,"" Trump spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement. The Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish advocacy group, was less sure. ""Trivialization of the Holocaust and gas chambers is NEVER okay,"" they tweeted at Trump Jr. .@DonaldJTrumpJr: Trivialization of the Holocaust and gas chambers is NEVER okay. https://t.co/jL2ZC9Z8pH ? ADL (@ADL_National) September 15, 2016 Clinton's campaign was especially biting, turning its response into an attack on Trump the candidate, with chairman John Podesta saying the son's language is ""probably pretty consistent with the type of rhetoric he heard around the house growing up."" Posting image of alt-right mascot 'Pepe the Frog' with Trump As Clinton was feeling the fallout from her ""basket of deplorables"" comment -- in which she initially suggested that half of Trump's supporters fit in a group composed of the ""racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it"" -- Trump Jr. made headlines with a controversial Instagram post. The photoshop composition featured his father leading a band of ""deplorables,"" with political allies and the cartoon ""Pepe the Frog"" by his side. What Trump Jr. later said he did not know, was that ""Pepe"" has been appropriated as a mascot and preferred meme of the white supremacist alt-right movement. Asked about the post by ABC News on Sunday, Trump Jr. pleaded ignorance. ""I've never even heard of Pepe the Frog,"" he said. ""I had no idea there was any connotation there."" Promotes anti-Clinton conspiracies His father's feed might get more attention, but Trump Jr. is just as active -- and sometimes more controversial. He often retweets the actor James Woods, who frequently shares suspect anti-Clinton media. ""What is wrong with her?"" Woods asked in a recent tweet, shared by Trump Jr., that quoted another user who wrote: ""BREAKING!!! Collapsing Hillary Clinton Heavily Sedated as she responds to Donald Trump comment & #Chelsea !! #Valium"" What is wrong with her? https://t.co/VErndznK3D ? James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) September 18, 2016 After a recent NBC News forum, Trump Jr. retweeted a post from right wing radio host John Cardillo, who was among the conspiracy theorists saying Clinton had been wearing an earpiece during the event.

But since the Balkan states closed their borders in March, the thousands of refugee children marooned in Greece have had little or no access to education, despite having reached Europe. They join an estimated 3.5 million refugee children across the globe who are missing out on school. Starting this month, the Greek government is hoping to change that by enrolling refugees in public schools ? but for the past seven months, children in camps have only had access to casual volunteer-run classes. The [Greek] ministry of education hopes to enrol thousands of refugee children in Greek schools, starting by the end of the month. Of the 27,000 children stranded in Greece, at least 18,000 are thought to be of school age. ?It?s not really a school, just a class,? Foual says of the education project in Kara Tepe. His elder sister, 11-year-old Melek, interrupts: ?It?s not like in Lebanon where we had a system and a curriculum. Here,it a little Greek, a little English, just one class for an hour a day.? A lost generation Rights organisations have long warned of a ?lost generation? of refugee children missing out on education. The crisis is particularly dire among Syrians: 1.5 million children who have fled to neighbouring Turkey, Jordan or Lebanon are not in school, creating a surge in child labour and early marriage. In Greece, the average refugee child has been out of school for a year and a half, according to the NGO Save the Children. Initially, education was not a priority for the Greek government, which has struggled to provide even basic services to the 60,000 asylum-seekers now marooned in the country. Yet with registration and relocation programmes moving at asnail pace, there is a growing realisation that the tens of thousands of asylum-seekers will remain in Greece for some time. ?Things change every week, but we assume they are going to be stuck for a while,? says Naoko Imoto, an education specialist for UNICEF in Greece. ?We?re thinking about years, really.? Accordingly, the Greek government has begun planning for the long term. The ministry of education hopes to enrol thousands of refugee children in Greek schools, starting by the end of the month. Of the 27,000 children stranded in Greece, at least 18,000 are thought to be of school age. A segregated school system For the current school year, refugee children will be taught separately from Greek students. These so-called ?reception classes? will take place in the afternoon, four hours a day, focusing on Greek and English, mathematics and IT. The aim, the government says, is to prepare the refugee students to join normal classes in the coming year ? either in Greece or elsewhere in Europe. For younger children, kindergartens are planned to be opened in camps. Even though asylum seekers will initially be taught separately from Greek children, the move has been met with opposition. On Tuesday, a parents? association in the northern Greek town of Filippiada complained about the plan, voicing fears about diseases and arguing that their children would be unable to ?coexist with migrant children?. Refugee children, the parents? association states, had ?different perceptions on the role of family, the place of women and religion to Greek children whose parents have made sacrifices to offer their children the best education.? The Greek education ministry earlier this month dismissed a complaint from a parents? association in Oresteiada, another town on the northern mainland, which had threatened a sit-in protest if children from camps were admitted into their school. Nikos Filis, the education minister, says the integration of refugee children would be ?gradual,? and that pupils would be vaccinated before attending public schools. ?Hence, there is no serious justification? for the parents? protests but ?only prejudice,? Filis says. Until the official programme comes into effect, however, volunteers and refugee teachers continue to plug the gap. Makeshift schools have popped up in most camps, but attendance is voluntary, and teaching refugee children come with challenges. ?Some of them never went to school,? says Corien Tiemersma, a Dutch volunteer who has taught English in the Malakasa camp north of Athens, home to nearly a thousand mostly Afghan refugees. ?And at the beginning, theyweren used to sitting down.? VolunteersUNICEF Imoto hopes that formal education will introduce stability to the lives of children living in limbo in Greece. ?It?s urgent that we get these children into school, so that they have an education but also a sense of normalcy and hope,? she says. Imoto said they were also planning to train refugees who were teachers in their home countries to give classes in thechildren mother tongues, something Greek schools cannot provide. ?They are the biggest resource we have,? she says. Education for her children was her prime motivation for making the perilous crossing to Greece, [Amal Ismail] explains, pouring the tea into glass jars that serve as cups. In Nea Kavala, a military-run tent camp north of Thessaloniki, refugees and volunteers work side-by-side in thecamp community centre. Mahmoud Mohammad, a former tailor fromSyria Kurdish-majority Afrin area, is using his English skills to teach children in the camp. The school, he says, ?is the most important achievement in the camp.? He works alongside five others, including Ragda, a Syrian teacher from Idlib, who has been giving Arabic classes for four months. ?I began volunteering because there are a lot of kids here and they should go to school,? Ragda says. There have been some difficulties, she admits. ?There are some Yazidi and Kurdish children whodon speak Arabic, so I had to teach them Arabic first.? ?I want to study? But with limited resources and few trained teachers, the Nea Kavala school is unable to provide formal education. Classes run for only two hours a day. ?I want to study. I dropped out at eighth grade in Syria,? says Rewan, a 15-year-old refugee from Afrin who has been in Nea Kavala for six months. ?Butthere no real school.It an hour a day plus language classes, and the first level includes everyone from first to eighth grade.? A few tent rows away, Amal Ismail, a Kurdish woman from Aleppo, boils water for tea in a rusty tin. Her children, three girls and a boy, have missed out on years of school; her 11-year-old son worked with her husband in a clothing factory inTurkey Izmir for two years to support the family. Education for her children was her prime motivation for making the perilous crossing to Greece, she explains, pouring the tea into glass jars that serve as cups. They had been in Nea Kavala for seven months. ?We lived in fear in Syria,? she says. ?We thoughtwe be free of fear in Europe.

"The stated reason the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Departmentdidn release their body cam and dash cam footage of the shooting was that by doing so, it might interfere with the investigation. Amid calls from the public and KeithScott family to release the footage of the shooting, the police have now decided to comply with those demands. Police chief Kerr Putney had been saying that the video footagedidn show conclusive evidence that Scott was holding a gun. Neither footage from the dash cam and one of the officers body cams showed it, and the officer who fatally shot Scott ? Brentley Vinson, a black man ?wasn wearing a body camera. So, the footage has now been released, but itdoesn make the incident any clearer. Scott is seen very briefly and from no angles that show whether or not he was holding a weapon. What is seen in the video, however, is Scott inching backwards right before he got shot. Hedidn appear to be pointing anything at anyone. So, if he had a gun in his hand, hewasn aiming at any of the cops. Was it necessary for the police to shoot Scott?It hard to say at this point, since all we have are bits and pieces, and the police report.

"UK Begins Construction On ?Great Wall? ? Meant to Keep Illegal Migrants OUT (VIDEO) The United Kingdom began construction on what is being called their ?great wall? near the border at Calais, France. The wall is being built to prevent illegal migrants from jumping onto vehicles preparing to cross the English Channel. The wall will cost an estimated two million pounds ? about $2.5 million ? and will be approximately 13 feet high.

"Story highlights Clinton said people with disabilities are ""invisible, overlooked and undervalued"" Clinton added that as president, she would do away with the subminimum wage Orlando, Florida (CNN) Hillary Clinton's aides wanted their candidate to start talking more about policy and less about Trump. On Wednesday, Clinton did just that. The Democratic presidential nominee forcefully argued in favor of giving people with disabilities an equal chance at success during an event here, saying defending the disabled would be ""a vital aspect of my presidency."" The speech offered implicit contrast with Trump -- who last year memorably mocked New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, whose arthrogryposis impairs the movements in his arms. But Clinton entirely ignored the Republican nominee during the event, never using his name in the roughly 30-minute speech. Wednesday's speech was Clinton's fourth in a series of addresses where the former first lady is attempting to talk more about her values and proposals and less about Trump. Clinton's past ""Stronger Together"" speeches on faith, community service and children and families have been far more focused on Trump. Wednesday's address, instead, lived up to what Clinton's aides had hoped the series of speeches would be: More policy than politics.

I am not sure I would have been able to exercise it myself, but restraint is a virtue andit a presidential virtue,? Conway toldMSNBC Morning Joe Tuesday. ?To tell Hillary Clinton after she accused him of being terrible with women, to tell Hillary Clinton ?I was prepared to go rough tonight and I am not going to do it because your husband and daughter are here.? That is going to grow in importance in the next couple of days in a moment of great temperance and restraint.?

After the debate, Trump told CNN that ??I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, I can't do it,? indicating that he was uncomfortable leveling such an attack withClinton husband and daughter in the audience.

"On the night of September 26, as the house lights dim in the Mack Complex at Hofstra University and the TV cameras go live, millions of Americans will be riveted to the scene. Will Donald Trump seem well prepared? Will HillaryClinton commanding grasp of policy and nuance dazzle viewers? Will either candidate rise to the challenge and show voters that they have what it takes to be president? Experience suggestsit hard to make a positivebreakthrough with two candidates so well known and so widely disliked. But what is possible is a serious unforced error. Story Continued Below Over the 56 years that presidential debates have been televised, one of their great legacies has been the sudden, publicgaffe mistake live on TV that permanently cements the way voters see the candidate. Despite the hopeful aspirations of those voters who welcome a few hours of substantive deliberation on the major issues of the day, the truth is that these are televised performances. What the candidates say often matters less than how they look and what they do with their bodies: Every breath they take, every expression they make, and every emotion they convey can play a major role in determining how Americans evaluate their performances. And although debatesdon usually transform how most voters think of the candidates, they do confirm voters?impressions matters on Election Day. For both candidates, this will be a particularly big challenge. Donald Trump is a larger-than-life presence who likes to intimidate, cajole and verbally bully his opponents by saying things long considered out ofbounds could lead to an unforced error by Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton, who sometimes betrays an aversion to letting too much emotion show, has a steely temperament and stinging wit that could easily get underTrump skin, instigating him into losing control with the cameras rolling. If either of these happens, it will join the long line of memorable, campaign-changing moments that candidates fumbled into. 1. 1960: Nixon sweats while debating JFK Famously, the very first televised presidential debate offered early evidence that all future debates would be visual affairs. After eight years as vice president, Richard Nixon was running to inherit the White House from the enormously popular Dwight Eisenhower. His challenger was John F. Kennedy, the charismatic young Massachusetts senator whose eloquence and matinee-idol looks captivated much of the nation. On September 26, at the candidates? first debate, Nixon proved to be in strong command of policy. But he looked terrible. Famously, prior to the debate, he declined to have any makeup applied to his face. But that decision was made worse by the fact that for much of the previous two weeks, Nixon had been away from the campaign trail nursing a knee infection. As a result, he looked peaked. Video: The Biggest Unforced Errors in Debate History From Richard Nixon sweating on camera during the first presidential debate to George H.W. Bush checking his watch before an audiencequestion are some of the most prominent debate gaffes in U.S. history. During their televised rumble, Nixon could be seen sweating and, on camera, wiping his brow with a handkerchief. His pale color and five o'clock shadowdidn help. All of which undercut his performance against Kennedy, who was a vision of youthful vigor. 2. 1976: Ford and Carter freeze in a moment of crisis A more dramatic moment occurred on September 23, 1976, when the sound system malfunctioned inPhiladelphia Walnut Street Theater, forcing a 27-minute delay during the debate, during which President Gerald Ford and then-Governor Jimmy Carter awkwardly stood still on stage. The broadcast continued as the television crew worked furiously to fix the technical problems. Neither candidate wanted to move, fearing that it would somehow look bad to audiences at home, so instead they stood frozen in a comic parody better than anything that ?Saturday Night Live? could imagine. Moderators Robert McNeil and Jim Lehrer kept talking as the candidates ?stood helplessly like two Hollywood stand-ins,? wrote Jules Witcover in the Washington Post. Years later, Ford admitted that ?I suspect both of us would have liked to sit down and relax while the technicians were fixing the system, but I think both of us were hesitant to make any gesture that might look like weweren physically or mentally able to handle a problem like this.? In the end, both men were diminished; they seemed less like leaders than deer caught in headlights. 3. 1980:Carter grim-faced critiques seem too self-serious In politics, brevity can be a virtue. During his only debate with Ronald Reagan in the fall of 1980, Jimmy Carterdidn get that lesson. In front of a record-breaking 80.6 million viewers, Carter was hoping to paint Ronald Reagan as a creature of the farright like Barry Goldwater, the GOP nominee whom Lyndon Johnson so successfully branded as an extremist some 16 years earlier. As Reagan sought to present himself as a more moderate, relatable Republican, Carter tried to forcefully punch back in the form of a lengthy and detailed monologue about health care and how Reagan had opposed Medicare in 1964. While Carter looked grim on the attack, Reagan grinned like a mildly disappointed father and shot back with just one phrase: ?There you go again,? he said with a laugh. The line undercutCarter entire argument, making Reagan look like the bigger man. 4. 1984: Mondale letsReagan one-liner negate a serious weakness During1984 first debate, Reagan, then 73, aroused concern when he seemed to have trouble remembering his answers or following the questions. He stumbled over his words and lacked clarity with each statement. His opponent, former Vice President Walter Mondale, was crisp and sharp. In contrast, Reagan rambled through his closing statement to the alarm of his advisers. Lou Cannon wrote that Reagan left the stage admitting to campaign adviser Stu Spencer ?that he had flopped.? The Wall StreetJournal headline the next morning captured the zeitgeist: ?New Question in Race: Is Oldest President Now Showing his Age?? Fortunately for Reagan, he came back with a vengeance. In a later debate, when Baltimore Sun journalist Henry Trewitt asked Reagan if his age would prevent him from fulfilling the rigors of the presidency, Reagan had a quip for the ages: ?I will not make age an issue in this campaign. I will not exploit, for political purposes, myopponent youth and inexperience.? The audience erupted in laughter, including Mondale, which completely undercut the seriousness of the underlying charge. 5. 1988: Dukakis seems cold in the face of a deeply personal question Perhaps the most shocking and controversial opening question in any presidential debate was posed by CNN anchor Bernard Shaw to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis at the second debate of 1988. Dukakis was widely seen as a technocrat, a man whose inner character remained a mystery to many voters. The night before the debate, at 2 a.m., Shaw thought of the question that could crack that shell and elicit passion from the candidate. And so he began the debate with it: ?Governor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?? Reporters were shocked, but Dukakis seemed unperturbed. In a clinical and dispassionate manner, Dukakis simply said ?No, Idon Bernard, and I think you know thatI opposed the death penalty during all of my life. Idon see any evidence thatit a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.? It was as though Dukakis was talking about a stranger, answering in the same tone that a professor might use to explain a basic point of fact in the classroom. Voters were taken aback by how little passion the candidate seemed to have. ?It was a question aboutDukakis values and emotions,? his campaign director, Susan Estrich, later recalled. ?When he answered by talking policy, I knew we lost the election.? 6. 1992: Bush checks his watch while an audience member asks a question During the 1992 campaign, few moments were more devastating to George H.W. Bush than his decision to look at his wrist watch in the middle of a town-hall debate with Bill Clinton and Ross Perot. Right before an audience member asked the candidates how the national debt personally affected the lives of the candidates and how they could relate to the economic challenges of average Americans, Bush was seen looking down to figure out how many minutes were left. ?Only 10 more minutes of this crap,? Bush would later say he was thinking at the time. Checking the timewould been unflattering in a normal debate setup, but coming as itdid a debate in which ordinary Americans posed questions to the presidentialcandidates seemed like Bush was bored and uninterested in hearing what real people had to say. For a candidate already under attack for not being concerned about domestic policy, his glance seemed to confirm everything that was said about him. 7. 2000: Gore sighs, eye-rolls and miscalculates in a confrontation with Bush Entering the debates in 2000, Vice President Al Gore and his supporters were pretty confident that they were up against a political lightweight in George W. Bush. Gore had been in high-profile debates before, and his team was confident that the debates would show American voters that Bush, a relative lightweight known to stumble over his words, lacked the clarity and gravitas needed to be president. During the first debate,Gore overdramatic attempts to emphasize how exasperated he was with Bush backfired big time. At several points, microphones caught Gore loudly sighing in response toBush answers, which played into Republican arguments that he was arrogant and condescending. And as Bush criticized theDemocrat plans for their ?fuzzy math,? Gore was seen on the split screen rolling his eyes and shaking his head in frustration. At the third debate, a town-hall-style affair, one of the oddest moments of this or any other debate happened: Gore walked right up to Bush as he was speaking, as if to physically intimidate him. Looking up with an annoyed glance, Bush seized the moment, nodding his head with a smirk, and continuing on with his statement, makingGore action look odd as the audience laughed. Donna Brazile, who ranGore campaign, believed that Gore won the debates on policy but ?on mannerisms and the takeaway, he ended up losing ? many of us remember the split-screen, and Al Gore was sitting there, rolling his eyes, perhaps, looking at George Bush, and basically he started to sigh.? 8. 2004: Bush cannot contain his irritation at Kerry After the first debate of the general election in 2000, President Bush came under criticism when hecouldn contain how annoyed he was by some of the comments his opponent, Senator John Kerry, made aboutBush record. Though Bush had benefited from the visuals of his 2000 debates against Vice President Al Gore, the criticsweren so kind to Bush in 2004, when cameras caught him scowling, clenching his jaw and leaning tensely over his lectern, as he listened to Kerry speak. The Democratic National Committeedidn wait long to pounce on the president. In their online video, ?Faces of Frustration,? viewers were treated to a repeat of the split screen showing Kerry calmly speaking on the left side of the screen withBush angry looks on the right side. *** Appearances are not the only thing that matters in the debates, of course. What the candidates say will be endlessly scrutinized with the media, while the quality of the one-line zingers, particularly in the viral age of Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, are important in shaping perceptions of the event. And on September 26, 56 years to the day since Nixon awkwardly sweated his way through the debate with JFK,we see what happens. Julian E.

"The State Department has refused to make public that and other emails Hillary Clinton exchanged with Barack Obama. | Getty Obama used a pseudonym in emails with Clinton, FBI documents reveal President Barack Obama used a pseudonym in email communications with Hillary Clinton and others, according to FBI records made public Friday. The disclosure came as the FBI released its second batch of documents from its investigation intoClinton private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. Story Continued Below The 189 pages the bureau released includes interviews with some ofClinton closest aides, such as Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills; senior State Department officials; and even Marcel Lazar, better known as the Romanian hacker ?Guccifer.? In an April 5, 2016 interview with the FBI, Abedin was shown an email exchange between Clinton and Obama, but the longtime Clinton aide did not recognize the name of the sender. ""Once informed that the sender's name is believed to be a pseudonym used by the president, Abedin exclaimed: 'How is this not classified?'"" the report says. ""Abedin then expressed her amazement at the president's use of a pseudonym and asked if she could have a copy of the email."" The State Department has refused to make public that and other emails Clinton exchanged with Obama. Lawyers have cited the ""presidential communications privilege,"" a variation of executive privilege, in order to withhold the messages under the Freedom of Information Act. The report doesn't provide more details on the contents of that particular email exchange, but says it took place on June 28, 2012, and had the subject line: ""Re: Congratulations."" It may refer to the Supreme Court's ruling that day upholding a key portion of the Obamacare law. It's been known since last year that Obama and Clinton corresponded occasionally via her private account, but the White House has insisted Obama did not know she relied on it routinely and exclusively for official business. A report on the FBI's June 7, 2016 interview with ""Guccifer"" confirms FBI Director James Comey's claim that Lazar falsely asserted that he'd surreptitiously accessed Clinton's server. ""Lazar began by stating that he had never claimed to hack the Clinton server. [An FBI agent] then advised that Fox News had recently published an article which reported that Lazar had claimed to hack the Clinton server. Lazar then stated that he recalled the interview with Fox News, and that he had lied to them about hacking the Clinton server."" Additional FBI interviewees whose reports were made public Friday included Jake Sullivan, Clinton's policy planning director; Bryan Pagliano, a former Clinton technology aide; Monica Hanley, a veteran Clinton aide who worked for her in the Senate and at State; and Sidney Blumenthal,Clinton longtime confidant. Hanley revealed in her FBI interview that she had no idea where a thumb drive she used to store an archive of Clinton's emails had gone. Hanley searched for the thumb drive, which the FBI described as ""something she happened to have laying around the house,"" several times but was unable to find it. The interviews provide more insight into Clinton's lack of technical acumen. According to the FBI's Abedin writeup, she ""could not use a computer""; Hanley said Clinton had no idea what her own email password was, and had to rely on aides. The so-called ""302"" reports also detail FBI interviews with former Secretary of State Colin Powell, former CIA acting director Mike Morell, State Department official Pat Kennedy, State Department Inspector General Steve Linick, Bill Clinton aide Justin Cooper, former diplomatic security chief Eric Boswell and longtime diplomat Lewis Lukens. Some of the interview reports had the subject's name removed on privacy grounds before the records were released. Many of those people seem to be computer technicians or lower-level State Department officials. The FBI published 58 pages of documents earlier this month that revealed Clinton had relied on others? judgment to not send her classified material during email correspondences. ?Clinton did not recall receiving any emails she thought should not be on an unclassified system,? the FBI said in its Sept. 2 report. ?She relied on State officials to use their judgment when emailing her and could not recall anyone raising concerns with her regarding the sensitivity of the information she received at her email address.?",0.05805243400000001,0.011235955,0.001872659,0.014981273,0.099250936,0.25093633,0.0,2,-1,1
"Confusion aboutTrump strategy runs beyond the scale of his advertising ?it the unpredictable nature of where and when he is advertising. 2016 Trump's bizarre ad strategy It's less than 50 days until the election and the GOP nominee's television advertisements have all but vanished.It seven weeks before Election Day, five days before the highly anticipated first debate, and DonaldTrump television advertisements have all but vanished.Trump ads last ran nearly a week ago in four battleground states: Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Since then, the GOP presidential nominee has ceded the airwaves to Hillary Clinton ? and is only poised to launch a limited, less-targeted ad campaign in the days before nextweek debate. Story Continued Below While his campaign announced a new ad on Tuesday,it only going to run on national cable news stations and during two Sunday morning public-affairs shows, according to data from The Tracking Firm, a company that monitors media buys. And even with that seemingly modest buy ? the full extent of which wasn't clear on Wednesday night ? Clinton is still outspending him this week many times over. ?It?s unprecedented for a major-party nominee in this century to have such an on-again, off-again TV buy,? said Elizabeth Wilner, a former TV-network political director who, until last month, monitored political advertising for Kantar Media/CMAG. The strategy has perplexed political media buyers whoaren affiliated with the campaign.Trump campaign is underfunded compared to HillaryClinton ? his campaign had only $50 million on hand as of Aug. 30, according to documents filed with the Federal Election Commission Tuesday night ? butTrump failure to advertise consistently threatens the efficacy of his entire paid media campaign, limited as it is. The political media buyers, including Republicans who declined to be named in criticizing the nominee, warned that the effects of television ads are fleeting, and any benefit Trump might get from putting his paid advertisements in front of voters can be undone with time if those messagesaren reinforced. The GOPnominee absence is also compoundingClinton domination of the airwaves. Last week, Smart Media Group, a media buying firm that works with the Republican National Committee, wrote in a memo to the Trump campaign that through Sept. 12, Trump had spent just $17 million on TV ads, compared to $126 million for Clinton. If outside group spending is counted, the disparity is even more stunning: $244 million for Clinton versus $33 million for Trump. The highly unusual decision to go mostly dark in advance of the debate is emblematic ofTrump approach to television advertising in the general election, a patchwork effort that has engaged in swing states only in fits and starts. Of the 20 days thus far in September, Trump has advertised in Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania for 11 days, and for 12 in Ohio.He also run one-week flights in a number of other states beginning over Labor Day weekend, only to let those expire more than a week ago and decline to rebook. A Trump campaign spokesman declined to reply to inquiries on Tuesday and Wednesday about thecampaign strategy. Clinton, meanwhile, is continuing to blanket eight states in ads. Confusion aboutTrump strategy runs beyond the scale of his advertising ?it the unpredictable nature of where and when he is advertising. When Trump first launched his TV ads in mid-August, they were focused on four core states: Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Together, those states will award 82 electoral votes ? and Trump will win the election if he carries those four and holds all the other states Mitt Romney won in 2012. Trump went on the air in those states on August 19, and he kept advertising in them through September 6 or 7, depending on the state. While those ads were on the air, Trump expanded to six new states: Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire and Virginia. Ads began in those states in early September and ran for roughly one week ? including an eye-popping, $2.2-million buy in Virginia, where the Clinton campaign stopped advertising last month after pulling comfortably ahead in the polls. But the Trump ads ended between September 7 and September 10, depending on the state. Trump has been off the air in those places ever since. Meanwhile, he reengaged in his four core states ? Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania ? on September 12. (Both campaigns abstained from airing ads on the 15th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks.) After nearly a week off the air in those four states most central to his candidacy, Trump last Monday rolled out a combined $2.5-million ad buy over five days. But those reservations ended last Friday. In their place,Trump campaign is planning a limited ad campaign, buying time on four cable stations: Fox Business Network, Fox News Channel, MSNBC and CNBC.He also planning to run national ads during at least two of the national Sunday morning public affairs programs on broadcast TV: ?Fox News Sunday? andNBC ?Meet the Press.? For political purposes,it a relatively inefficient buy. The 11 states that make up POLITICO's Battleground States project hold roughly 29 percent of the population. That means, roughly speaking, that seven-in-10 Americans reached by a national ad buy live outside the battleground states. The Clinton campaign, on the other hand, continues to advertise heavily in eight targeted states: Arizona, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania, while also, at times, running national advertisements. (Thecampaign investments in Arizona, which has voted Republican in 15 of the last 16 presidential elections, are much smaller than in the other states.) Just this week ? from Tuesday through next Monday, the day of the first debate ? Clinton is poised to spend nearly $6.8 million on TV ads, backed up by another $5.6 million from pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA Action in those states, minus Arizona.Trump air cover from outside groups is also far more limited thanClinton. Rebuilding America Now, a pro-Trump super PAC, is spending $635,000 in Pennsylvania this week. And an anti-Clinton super PAC based in Wisconsin, Reform America Fund, is spending $332,000 in that state, where neither campaign has advertised thus far. There are some signsTrump campaign may be focusing on its seemingly haphazard ad efforts. GOP ad-maker Rex Elsass met with Trump campaign officials last week, POLITICO reported on Tuesday . The campaign has already reserved about $2.8 million in satellite TV ads slated to air beginning on Tuesday, Sept. 27, through the day before Election Day in eight states: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. For Trump,there risk in continuing to delay: Booking ads at the last minute, asTrump campaign has been doing, sometimes means spending more money for the same spot as a campaign that makes its reservations earlier. And there are some signs that some of the late decision-making is driven by the candidate: The New York Times reporte d earlier this month that Trump himself has been selecting the media markets in which the campaign has been advertising. Since research suggests the effects of television ads are short-lived ? and with the race tightening in the battleground states in recent weeks, Trump can ill-afford to regress. ?It has to be consistent,? said one GOP ad-buyer, ?because the recall on these just evaporates when you go dark.?

"Police robots are all over the news. Early Monday morning, FBI agents and New Jersey police officers used a bomb-squad robot to try to defuse the makeshift bombs found near a train station in Elizabeth. (The explosives ended up detonating after police used the machine to try to cut a wire.) Earlier this month,sheriff deputies from Los Angeles used a robot to disarm a violent suspect who had barricaded himself inside a berm in a Southern California desert. And last Friday, another robot was used to force doors open as police searched for a gunman hiding out in an Amtrak train. But perhaps the most ground-breaking?and potentiallyunnerving of robot-enabled policing took place in July when officers in Dallas used a robot to subdue a gunman, and ended up killing him. The man, later identified as Micah X. Johnson, had shot and killed police officers at a protest in thecity downtown. His rampage left five officers dead and at least nine other people injured. The suspect fled into a local community college (not a parking structure, as had initially been reported) where he barricaded himself in an alcove at the end of a corridor. The police on his tailcouldn approach because Johnson was still firing at them periodically, and there was nowhere to take cover in the corridor. During the standoff, Johnson told the officers he wanted to kill more people, and he said he had planted bombs in the area. With about 58 students and college staff still locked down inside thebuilding eight people sheltering in a room on the floor below theshooter officers decided they could not wait Johnson out. Instead, they placed plastic explosives on a robot and sent it down the corridor. When it got to the alcove, they detonated the explosives, ultimately killing Johnson. Story Continued Below The news that the Dallas police department had killed a suspect using a robot shocked the country. It struck many as ruthless and excessive, if not downright illegal. To many, the killing seemed like an extra-judicial execution. It has provoked new fears at a time when police across the United States are being accused of excessive use of force, especially against blacks, including recent incidents just this past week in Tulsa, Okla, and Charlotte, N.C. For some critics, the idea of using bomb-enabled police robots to kill suspects could make matters only worse, calling to mind images of Terminators run amok or military drones taking out wedding parties. It has also reignited debates about ?militarized policing.? ?When things get easy, they tend to get overused,? said Jay Stanley, an American Civil Liberties Union policy analyst who studies the civil-liberties implications of new technologies. He is concerned that the Dallasincident experts say is the first known case of police using a robot to deploy lethalforce be the beginning of a slippery slope. ?The kind of incident where there is a clear and present danger represents the tip of a very large pyramid,? he said. There is evidence the Dallas police resorted to plastic explosives only because there were no other viable options. Thor Eells, chairman of the National Tactical Officers Association, told POLITICO that the Dallas police were hoping to take Johnson alive, going so far as bringing a trauma surgeon to the scene to begin treating Johnson if he survived the blast. The plastic explosives were necessary, experts say, because the officers needed to make sure Johnson would be incapacitated immediately (and thus unable to trigger his bombs). Both tear gas and pepper spray, as painful as they are, would have left him functional, and a ?flash-bang? grenade ran the risk of detonating any bombs Johnson might have on him. Still, Dallas? robot-enabled killing raises a host of questions that the wider society is still grappling with. ?Does this remain something that is only used in extraordinary circumstances?? asked Stanley. ?Or do police departments start clamoring for robots specifically designed to use force?? Stanley believes armed robots could make police officers quicker to pull a trigger, an unnerving prospect at a time when civil liberties activists say too many police are still too quick to do that already. ?Let?s saythere a protest, and therearen any police on the scene,? he said, ?and a robot starts spraying pepper spray, or tear gas, or rubber bullets, on the crowd, and they do it with poor situational awareness??the cameras on robotsdon provide the same visual acuity to their operators that a human on scene would have organically??and they hit people who are not involved, or they do it whenit not necessary.? SWAT experts push back against such fears. They point to existing laws that currently govern the situations in which law enforcement agencies may use force. ?I am still legally responsible for having to explain and justify [any] level of force,? said Eells. ?The mechanism of how the force is delivered is irrelevant to the courts.? And unlike firearms, which are distributed to all officers, only specialized SWAT teams own the large, expensive robots capable of killing a person. ?You?re not going to see a plethora of these things in the future,? said Sid Heal, president of the California Association of Tactical Officers who, while serving in the Los AngelesSheriff Department, was a national leader in assessing and pioneering new technologies. Stanley counters, however, that every new technology introduces gray areas in which new kinds of abuse can seep in. He points to Tasers. Laws concerning use of force govern Tasers the same way they govern robots or pistols. ?As it happens, [Tasers] are vastly overused,? Stanley said. ?They?re often used to get recalcitrant suspects to cooperate with the police [or] as a punishment for dissing a cop.? Plus, though they were promoted as ?less-than-lethal? alternatives to guns, they have nevertheless killed people. ?Often, the way new technologies play out on the ground is not the way you would expect,? Stanley said. All of this raises questions about whether new laws are needed to govern robots and drones. Some states, including Oregon, Virginia and Wisconsin, have outright banned law enforcement agencies from arming drones. Only North Dakota, so far, has explicitly permitted police to put weapons on drones, though only with less-than-lethal munitions, such as tear gas, bean bags and Tasers. In states with no such laws, police departments simply operate as they see fit, within the context of existing law. Ryan Calo, a professor at the University of Washingtonwho a leading expert on the intersection of robots and law, said making law enforcement agencies draft policies about how and when they can use robots and drones forces them to think through scenarios in advance. ?If you want to put a Taser on a drone and tase a mentally ill person,? Calo said, ?or if you want to follow someone around with a drone,that where you need to have a process in place thatyou properly vetted with the leadership.? *** Robots are not new to policing. Most people are familiar with the bomb-squad versions, which have been in use for about 20 years. The large machines are maneuvered by remote control to inspect suspicious objects, and sometimes detonate them, while keeping humans out ofharm way.What less well known is that SWAT teams are also increasingly using robots. The most common application is reconnaissance. In the middle of a standoff, where a suspect is barricaded in a room or a building, SWAT officers can toss small, camera-bearing devices, nicknamed ?throwbots,? into a building to assess the situation. Robots can be used to deliver phones to people police are negotiating with. They can be used to search a parking lot for a suspect hiding under acar of having an officer lower their head and risk getting it blown off. Robots have been used in more creative situations as well. In one case, a SWAT team used a robot to reach through a window and pull a blanket off of a suicidal person to check whether he had a weapon. (Hedidn.) In other cases, robots have swept homes for booby traps, andthey often used to toss tear gas or pepper spray into rooms, to disable suspects before officers enter. In the California desert earlier this month,sheriff deputies used a robot to creep up behind the suspect and take away his rifle while he was distracted by helicopters and police officers yelling at him through loudspeakers. Police argue that these kinds of robots actually help save lives. Officers who are executing a search warrant in a volatile situation can send a robot in first. Send in an armed human, and the situation could quickly escalate into a shooting match. Send in a robot, and police can get a lay of the land and even start communicating with a suspect before putting an officer into the mix. Using a robot to approach the suspect in the desert earlier this month kept everyone safe, said Capt. Jack Ewell, head of the Los Angeles County SheriffDepartment Special Enforcement Division. As soon as the suspect realized his weapon was gone, he surrendered. ?It prevented a potential shooting in which he could have been harmed, we could have been harmed, or a stray bullet could have been gone somewhere,? Ewell said. But using a robot to kill?That something new. The SWAT experts POLITICO spoke with said theydidn know of a previous situation where a police department had used a robot to deploy lethal force. But they addedit not likelywe suddenly see police departments regularly using robots this way. For one thing, robots like the one in Dallas are expensive. Most SWAT teamscan afford them. The machines are large and unwieldy, weighing 400 to 800 pounds. Police departments need trailers just to move them about. Theyaren particularly mobile. While they can roll down a simple corridor or street, theycan maneuver through a building as quickly a human can. (The robot used in Dallas, a Remotec Andros Mark V-A1, weighs nearly 800 pounds, and it can go only 3.5 mph.) And while robots can be outfitted with a firearm, the robot is never going to have the same agility in handling a dynamic situation as a well-trained SWAT officer. We alsowon soon be seeing autonomousmachines-style ?killer robots? that act on their own. Even the militarydoesn give its robots independent shooting power. Military drones do perform certain actions on theirown flying to a specific location or circling a target. But when it comes to pulling a trigger, the military still insists on keeping a ?man in the loop.? Police departments are no different. ?We recognize the grave responsibility we have with making the decision to use force,? saidNTOA Eells, who is also commander of the Colorado Springs SWAT team. ?There?s a tremendous reluctance to give that up.? As for the controversial kinds of drone killings that the U.S. has committed overseas, the laws governing the military use of force abroad are different from those that govern law enforcement agencies at home. ?Domestic law is based on the Constitution,? Heal said. ?Everything we do has to be traced back to that rock.? *** As much as anything, thepublic reaction to the Dallas robot underlines the gulf between police departments and the public in their understandings of the new devices. In a news conference immediately following the standoff, police Chief David Brown said the department had used a ?bomb robot.? The shorthand was clear to him; he meant the department had used a robot belonging to the bomb squad. But many in the public understood those words differently: that there was a robot designed to be a bomb. This, as much as anything, might be what many found so upsetting. And while it was clear to law enforcement officers across the country that the Dallas SWATteam primary goal was to subdueJohnson killhim lack of detail released by Dallas police about the challenges it faced in apprehending Johnson, especially in an age when so many people are already up in arms about police killings of black men, left many in the public with the impression that the police simply sought to execute him. Even those who study this subject were left confused about thepolice objectives. ?I was surprised that they did purposely kill someone with a robot,? said one expert. Police departments naturally view new technologies just as additional tools thatdon fundamentally change the parameters in which they operate. The public, however, often sees new devices as potentially threatening. Take Seattle, for example. Several years ago, thecity police department bought two Draganflyer X6drones hand-held mini-copters?as reconnaissance tools for use during hostage standoffs and search-and-rescue operations. Seattle residents, however, immediately became alarmed about the ways the devices could threaten personal privacy, and they rose up against them. The backlash might have surprised the Seattle police, knowing as they did that any surveillance inside a private space would require the same kind of warrant as an inspection done in person. In the face of the outcry, however, thecity mayor shut the program down. (The copters were gifted to the LA police.) The implications, according toUW Calo, are potentially unfortunate. ?Now, if a kid gets lost in a park,? he said, ?the Seattle police departmentcan roll out their drone to find them.? In a 2012, Lt. Anthony Martinez of the Fresno police department wrote a thesis forCalifornia Law Enforcement Command College that pinpointed this very problem. The paper examined how new types of robots could potentially save police lives by removing humans from scenarios in which robots could perform equally well. Martinez surveyed representatives from law enforcement and civic groups about what they saw as the potential challenges. Costs and legal questions certainly came up, but the top concern wassociety acceptance. Take the example of a robot performing an initial house search. ?From a law enforcement perspective, it seems like a no-brainer,? Martinez said, becauseyou reducing the chance an officer will get hurt. ?But if you flip that around, people might not be ready to have a robot come into their house and tell them what to do.? In order to get the public to accept the use of robots, Martinez wrote in his paper, police departments first need to get the public familiar with them. That makes the Dallas operation a potential game-changer. Now that the public has seen a robot deploy force, previous institutional reluctance to use the devices this way might start to break down. ?Public perception is an important part of this,? Heal said. Commanders who before might have been reluctant to authorize the use of force by a robot, he said, ?now see that their careers are survivable.? The fact that we might see novel uses of robots in critical situations is why theACLU Jay Stanley thinks there needs to be more discussion of what communities are willing to accept, especially intoday incendiary environment. ?This has started a whole new conversation,? he said. ?It?s worth pausing to think about what it means for us as a society.?",0.03220339,0.006779661,0.009039548,0.023163842,0.047457627,0.26666666699999997,0.0,2,-1,1
"Story highlights Boy sent letter to Barack Obama, offering to take in five-year-old Syrian refugee Omran. After posting the letter on Facebook, the US President urged readers: ""We should all be more like Alex."" (CNN) A six-year-old boy from New York has won the respect of US President Barack Obama and thousands of others after he offered to take in Omran Daqneesh, a little boy who was injured after his home in Aleppo, Syria, was bombed. The image of five-year-old Omran sat alone in an ambulance, covered in dust and blood, shocked the world and inspired six-year-old Alex, from Scarsdale, New York, to take action. In a handwritten letter sent to the White House, Alex asked Obama to go and collect Omran and bring him to his house where ""we will be waiting for you guys with flags, flowers, and balloons."" In his letter to Obama, Alex offered to teach Omran how to ride a bike. Alex said that Omran could be part of his family, and offered to be his brother. He said he would teach him how to speak English, to ride a bike and added that his sister Catherine would share her toys with him. Obama read Alex's words aloud in a speech he gave at the United Nations earlier this week, before posting a video of Alex reading the letter himself to Facebook.

" Over 375 of theworld leading scientific minds published an open letter on Tuesday warning America about the dangers that a Donald Trump presidency presents to the environment. The Republican nominee, who believes that global warming is a hoax created by the Chinese, has stated his intention to pull out of the historic Paris climate change treaty that President Obama signed a few months ago with all 194 other countries in the world. That agreement, expected to be implemented by at least 61 of theworld worst polluters (accounting for 47% of all emissions), is set to be ratified by the end of the year. The letter, signed by such notable names as Stephen Hawking and over 30 Nobel laureates, paints a bleak picture for our nation if Trump is elected and reneges on our international climate treaty obligations. From studies of changes in temperature and sea level over the last million years, we know that the climate system has tipping points. Our proximity to these tipping points is uncertain. We know, however, that rapid warming of the planet increases the risk of crossing climatic points of no return, possibly setting in motion large-scale ocean circulation changes, the loss of major ice sheets, and species extinctions. The climatic consequences of exceeding such thresholds are not confined to the next one or two electoral cycles. They have lifetimes of many thousands of years. The political system also has tipping points. Thus it is of great concern that the Republican nominee for President has advocated U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Accord. A Parexitwould send a clear signal to the rest of the world: ?The United States does not care about the global problem of human-caused climate change. You are on your own.? Such a decision would make it far more difficult to develop effective global strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change. The consequences of opting out of the global community would be severe and long-lasting ? for ourplanet climate and for the international credibility of the United States. The United States can and must be a major player in developing innovative solutions to the problem of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Nations that find innovative ways of decarbonizing energy systems and sequestering CO2 will be the economic leaders of the 21st century. Walking away from Paris makes it less likely that the U.S. will have a global leadership role, politically, economically, or morally. We cannot afford to cross that tipping point. Donald Trump, in a nod to the fossil fuel oligarchs that pull the strings of the Republican Party, complains that the Paris Agreement ?gives foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we use right here in America.? That assertion is of course ludicrous; under the Paris Climate Agreement, each country develops its own plan; while countries openly share their progress towards their emission reduction targets with each other, no country can tell another what to do. But what Trump is really defending is the ability of multinational energy companies to extract every last ounce of value out the environment and reap as much profit as they can before the consequences of their pyromaniacal carbon frenzy catches up to them. They know the end of their gravy train is coming soon ? but if they succeed, it will be far too late for the rest of us. Anyone with half a brain can see that month after month brings the highest temperatures ever recorded. Only a fool would refuse to acknowledge how storms hit with more fury than they did before; that droughts are longer and wildfires deadlier. Natural disasters will increase in intensity and frequency if we continue to pollute as quickly as we do. The wrath of Gaia is the biggest threat facing the human race ? and we must confront it head on if we want human civilization to survive as we know it. Electing Donald Trump would be the absolute worst thing that we could do for our nation and for the world as a whole. You can read the full letter here.

Conway said, ?Yes, andhe be happy to offer those specifics without telling the enemy exactly whatwe going to do.? ?So just to put a button on it,we get the ISIS plan tonight in the debate??

"It was just over a year ago, at a nationally televised debate, when Donald Trump chided Jeb Bush for speaking another language on the campaign trail. ?This is a country,? Trump said standing at the lectern next to Bush, ?where we speak English, not Spanish.? The crowd at the Ronald Reagan presidential library applauded. Ever since, Trump has stayed true to his word. Story Continued Below With 46 days until the November elections, and as early voting begins in a handful of states, Trump is on the precipice of becoming the only major-party presidential candidate this century not to reach out to millions of American voters whose dominant, first or just preferred language is Spanish. Trump has not only failed to buy any Spanish-language television or radio ads, he so far has avoided even offering a translation of his website into Spanish, breaking with two decades of bipartisan tradition. ?He?s not willing to give into anything that shows that he wants to cater to us,? said Juan Hernandez, a Hispanic Republican and former adviser to President George W. Bush. ?And he believes that hedoesn have to. He believes he can still squeeze out a few more white, over 50 [year-old] votes.? While the majority of Latino voters are English-speaking,Trump refusal to campaign in Spanish is a powerful symbol of how little heed Trump has paid toAmerica shifting demographics. Latinos now make up about 10 percent of the national vote, with electorally potent concentrations in crucial battlegrounds such as Florida, Colorado, Nevada and even North Carolina. Adolfo Franco, a veteran Republican strategist who served as a top Hispanic surrogate for Mitt Romney and John McCain, said he had ?a more cynical view? ofTrump studied avoidance of campaigning in Spanish. ?I thinkthey made a calculation that going on Spanish TV in a more concentrated fashion and also placing ads in Spanish would upset his base,? Franco said.Trump bid for the White House has been powered by working-class white voters and summed up by his slogan ? Make America Great Again ? that appeals to a bygone era of prosperity whose disappearance is blamed on immigration and globalization. Trump called illegal Mexican immigrants rapists and drug-dealers in his announcement speech, and chants of ?Build that wall!? are among the loudest at his rallies. That has left a growing number of prominent Latino Republicans on the sidelines in 2016, backing Hillary Clinton or even Libertarian Gary Johnson, whom Hernandez has endorsed. Multiple members ofTrump National Hispanic Advisory Council resigned after his heated anti-immigrant rhetoric following his trip to Mexico. And one of the co-chairs ofRomney Hispanic outreach operation, former Bush Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez, has starred in a Spanish-language ad this cycle ? for Clinton. ?Votar por Trump? No puedo,? Gutierrez says. (Translation: ?Vote for Trump? Ican.?) Romney, McCain and Bush all operated Spanish-language versions of their websites. Romney dispatched his Spanish-speaking son, Craig, as an ambassador in TV ads and on the trail (?Somos unanaci de inmigrantes,? the younger Romney said in one ad). McCain and Bush, who both hailed from border states, ran Spanish-languages ads. Bush himself narrated some, memorably beginning them, ?Soy George W. Bush? with his distinctive Texas accent. Four years ago, a total of $23 million was spent on Spanish-language ads in the 2012 presidential race by Obama, Romney and their backers; so far in 2016, Trump has spent zero.Trump campaign declined to comment for this story. The Trumpcampaign most notable dabbling in Spanish consisted of a single word ? and it was misused. At the Republican convention in Cleveland, officials handed out signs that read ?Hispanics Para Trump,? which bothdidn translate Hispanics and used the incorrect Spanish word for for(para instead of por). In recent weeks, Clinton has begun airing hundreds of thousands of dollars in Spanish-language ads in Nevada and Florida. A trio of supportive super PACs, meanwhile, have announced a $3 million Spanish-language buy, so far in those same two states, as well as Colorado. In addition,Clinton running mate, Tim Kaine, spoke in Spanish at both his vice-presidential announcement and convention speeches. Her website prominently features a half-dozen buttons atop the homepage; one of them ?Enespa? is the portal to her Spanish-language site. ?We have some voters that really want to communicate in Spanish,? said Lorella Praeli, the Clintoncampaign Latino outreach director, describing a three-pronged approach to wooing Hispanic voters ? in English, Spanish and a blend of both languages OfTrump approach to Latinos, Praeli said, ?He has insulted us and he has tried to demonize our community from the beginning.? In a sign ofTrump toxicity among Hispanic voters,he already being attacked in Spanish by a fellow Republican. Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois unveiled an ad last week touting that, ?Yo no apoyo a Trump,? which translates as ?Idon support Trump.? Behind the scenes,Trump campaign has done some quiet outreach to Latino Republicans ? and been repeatedly rebuffed. Several top Hispanic Republicans, including Hernandez and Franco, told POLITICO they were recruited to join Trump Tower as surrogates or advisers. They refused. Franco said he turned them down because ofTrump ?gross generalizations, xenophobia and a number of comments that have absolutely crossed the line.? ?Ididn even answer,? Hernandez scoffed.Trump Hispanic outreach has been run mostly by Helen Aguirre Ferr? of the Republican National Committee, who is respected by her peers, many of whom were surprised to see her take the job. She replaced Ruth Guerra, who reportedly resigned over objections to working on behalf of Trump. (Unlike Trump, the RNC has produced some materials in Spanish.) But few other prominent Hispanic Republicans have come on board. That has hurt the Trumpcampaign presence on Spanish-language television programs, where the surrogate program has been weak, said Alfonso Aguilar, who mobilized Hispanic supporters for Trump in July before rescinding his endorsement in protest overTrump immigration speech after his Mexico visit. Aguilar said he told the campaign, ?You?re leaving a vacuum for the opposition to define the narrative in Spanish-language media andthat exactlywhat happening.? When he was a surrogate, Aguilar said, there were no talking points or fact sheets, as there had been in the Romney, McCain and Bush campaigns. ?You can run a campaignthat different,? Aguilar said. ?But you still need a professional operation.? Lionel Sosa, who cut ads targeting Hispanic voters for Ronald Reagan, including in Spanish, said he was among those contacted byTrump team this year. He said he told them he would only help the campaign if Trump apologized for his past offensive remarks. ?I justcan stomach Donald Trump,? Sosa said. Instead,he backing Johnson. Sosa predicted Trump would win no more than 22 percent of the Latino vote ? worse thanRomney much-maligned 27 percent and far short ofBush high-water mark of 44 percent in 2004. (A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released on Thursday put Trump at 17 percent among likely Hispanic voters.) The path to the White House via an overwhelmingly white coalition is a narrow one. Romney won the highest share of the white vote in three decades, 59 percent, and still lost in 2012. And whites are expected to comprise a smaller share of the electorate in 2016 than 2012, due to the faster demographic growth among minorities nationwide.Trump team recognizes the difficult math they face, given theircandidate rhetoric and narrow coalition.It one of the reasons the Republican nominee has begun publicly appealing to black voters, appearing at African-American churches and talking about the plight of black America at many of his rallies. The Latino community has been mentioned far less often by Trump. ?In a way,he being smart,? said Alex Nogales, president of the National Hispanic Media Coalition and a Trump critic. ?Why waste his money on a communitythat not going to vote for him?? CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said Aguilar had joinedTrump Hispanic advisory council. He had independently organized support of Latino Republicans for Trump.",0.027531957000000003,0.0009832839999999999,0.003933137,0.004916421,0.044247787999999996,0.229105211,0.0019665679999999997,2,-1,1
"""This funding measure does not contain a single penny for Flint, Michigan,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said. | AP Photo Congress Democrats dig in with shutdown days away They feel like they have leverage and are pushing for money for Flint. As Congress careens toward a potential government shutdown, Democrats are dragging the funding fight to the brink and hoping to squeeze the GOP. The smart bet is still that Congress will pass some sort of stopgap bill to keep the government running past Friday. Neither party wants to risk being blamed for a shutdown just weeks before the presidential election. Story Continued Below But Democrats are driving a hard bargain: They say any government funding bill must include federal aid to address the water crisis in Flint.It a potentially risky move, but Democrats are betting they can either force Republicans to bend, or paint the GOP as indifferent to the people of Flint and responsible for CapitolHill deepening dysfunction. ""This funding measure does not contain a single penny for Flint, Michigan,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said on the Senate floor Monday. ""The people of Flint, Michigan have been waiting for emergency assistance to clean their poisoned water for more than a year."" The Senate is scheduled to hold a key procedural vote Tuesday on a proposal introduced by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. But that measure, which would fund the federal government through Dec. 9, is expected to fall short of the 60 vote threshold needed to advance. The biggest complaint from Democrats is that the bill includes $500 million to address flooding in Louisiana and natural disasters in other states, but no money for Flint, which is still dealing with the consequences of lead-contaminated drinking water. Top Democrats think it's a political miscalculation for Republicans to be excluding assistance to a largely African-American community with high rates of poverty. Reid said it was ""callous"" of Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) to refer to the calamity in Flint as ?otherpeople grief.? One potential resolution to the impasse is for McConnell to remove the money for Louisiana. ""Is their solution now to remove help for flood victims?"" McConnell asked on the floor Monday. ""If their solution is to remove help for flood victims, they should say so."" But Democrats might accept that, reasoning that they could return in the lame duck and press for aid for both communities. In recent weeks, Democrats have insisted that any aid for floods be coupled with aid for Flint. McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have been eager to show voters that Republicans can govern responsibly and have downplayed the latest skirmish. Ryan told CBS? John Dickerson in an interview that aired Sunday that there would be no government shutdown. ?I?m not worried about that,? he said. ?This is the typical drama.? And top Democratic strategists argue that the public has blamed Republicans for past shutdown showdowns ? giving them an advantage in this latest fight. ?We see our leverage in getting Flint aid as being the fact that Republicans lose every shutdown fight,? said a senior Democratic Senate aide. ?We know it. They know it.? White House press secretary Josh Earnest has said the president may not signMcConnell bill and urged Congress to act ?without putting the American people and the American economy through another cliffhanger related to a government shutdown.? The White House Office of Management and Budget has begun the earliest stages of preparing for a shutdown, holding a planning call with agencies last Friday ahead of the end of the fiscal year. ?The administration strongly believes that a lapse in appropriations should not occur,? said an OMB spokesperson. ?However, at this time, prudent management requires that the government plan for the possibility of a lapse and OMB is working with agencies to take appropriate action.? A senior GOP Senate aide said Senate Democrats were intentionally trying to foment chaos. ?They want to talk about shutdowns. They want to create chaos right before the election,? the aide said, adding that it was no coincidence the clash comes as Republican chances of holding on to the Senate majority have improved. Republicans note there is much in the legislation for Democrats to like. It includes $1.1 billion to combat the Zika virus without language that would exclude Planned Parenthood-affiliated clinics from accessing federal grant dollars ? a key Democratic demand that had long snarled Congress? effort to counter the mosquito-borne virus. The bill also funds veterans programs and provides some money to implement a popular law signed in July to curb prescription opioid addiction. And despite a strong push from conservatives like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and the backing of GOP nominee Donald Trump, the bill does not include language to block the Obama administration from relinquishing oversight of the Internet domain system to an international body.It a cleanbill, McConnell boasted, with no controversial policy riders. Democratsdon fully agree. They are irritated that the legislation prohibits the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring corporations to disclose political spending. That provision simply maintains current law, making it harder for Democrats to demand its removal since they permitted it in lastyear omnibus, but it offers them a chance to slam the GOP as beholden to corporate interests. Ahead ofTuesday procedural vote to end Senate debate on the package, aides were predicting the parties would remain largely united. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, has said he would support the so-called continuing resolution since it provides money to take on Zika, which has spread quickly in the Sunshine State. Other Democrats from states that would receive disaster aid in the bill, like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, might also buck party leaders. But McConnellcan count on keeping all Republicans on his side; Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he will oppose the bill because it would not lift financing restrictions on the Export-Import Bank. Cruz and other conservatives might also defect. Ryan and other Republicans argue that any debate on Flint aid should take place on water infrastructure legislation moving through Congress. The Senate passed that bill, which includes $220 million for Flint and other communities with failing infrastructure, on a 95-3 vote earlier this month. But the House version of the Water Resources Development Act, which is set for floor action this week, does not include any money for Flint. Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) has promised that any final negotiations on the bill, which would conclude in a December session, will end with Flint aid. But Democrats are skeptical after months of GOP resistance. ?I?m not going to accept, on faith, that if we leave Flint behind in the CR, somehow there will be an epiphany between now and December, and what they oppose today, they will suddenly embrace then,? said Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.). ?Nobody would buy that. Itdoesn make sense.? Kildee noted that Democrats will be crucial to helping House GOP leadership carry any stop-gap spending bill approved by the Senate across the finish line; many conservative Republicans wanted a long-term CR to avoid a lame duck budget battle and are likely to oppose whatever the Senate passes. The conservative group Heritage Action is opposed to the CR and is warning lawmakers it will include a vote on the bill on its influential scorecard. ?Harry Reid is playing dangerous and irresponsible games with military pay, national security and critical services as he aims to shut down the federal government,? said Rep. Bill Flores of Texas, chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee. Flores added that McConnell was ?caving in to this irresponsible behavior by surrendering important conservative policies.?

Debate crunch time, and questions about Trump's prep The first presidential debate is a week from Monday, and Donald Trump has made time on his Sunday schedule for prep sessions with senior advisers. But the unconventional nature of his candidacy extends to his study habits, and some on his team are a bit worried. How Trump is prepping (or not) for the debate How Trump is prepping (or not) for the debate 00:34 How Trump is prepping (or not) for the debate Maggie Haberman of the New York Times shared her reporting on Trump's aversion to holding mock debate sessions, among other things. ""He's playing it a little bit loose and in his sort of free-form style,"" said Haberman. ""But a lot of people around him are concerned that won't translate quite as well in a general election debate."" 2. Obama skipping Clinton Foundation event The Clinton Global Initiative, an offshoot of the Clinton Foundation, will hold its annual -- and final -- gathering Monday and Tuesday in New York.

Julie Pace of the Associated Press notes that the Clintons' initiative has come under fire this election year. ""Hillary Clinton would be happy if she could get through the rest of the campaign without having to talk anymore about the foundation, but she's going to have to grin and bear it for a few more days,"" said Pace. ""This is a three-day gathering with lots of celebrities, lots of big donors -- but there's some speculation it might not be as glitzy as in past years. And there's going to be one very notable absence headlining this meetings, and that's President Barack Obama."" 3. Clinton targets millennials in Ohio It's no secret Hillary Clinton has issues with younger voters, and she is looking to turn the tide. On Monday, Clinton will travel to Ohio to make her case to millennials by retracing some of her early work as a lawyer. Abby Philip of the Washington Post says trying to get younger voters to relate more to Clinton is the big goal. ""The focus of the speech is going to be about her early years -- what she did after she left college -- the focus on idealism and reminding young voters that she was kind of like them,"" said Phillip. ""And also like someone else, a young community organizer from Chicago, Barack Obama."" Will this humanize her? Make her seem more like a real person and less like a politician? Stay tuned. 4. Signs of progress for Trump in swing state Ohio is always a giant presidential battleground, and the GOP primary candidacy of its governor, John Kasich, adds another interesting wrinkle this year. Kasich is no Donald Trump fan -- far from it -- but some Ohio Republicans see signs that even former Kasich primary voters are turning to Trump in the general election. There's a lot of talk about the influx of newly registered Republican voters and CNN's Sara Murray reports that GOPers surveying those new party members in the Buckeye State are finding firmer-than-expected Trump support. ""They're finding Donald Trump has strong support from Democrats who are now Republicans, Independents who are now Republicans,"" Murray said. ""People who registered to vote for John Kasich in the primaries are now backing Trump. And what should be particularly worrisome for Democrats in Ohio is that they (the GOP) are finding far more support than they expected among female voters."" 5.

Do you take time -- and resources -- to follow up with that voter to make sure they cast their ballot? Democrats privately concede that Portman appears to be on an easy path to re-election, so it is less of a conflict for them. Ohio is a tough state, and the Clinton campaign will try to motivate every last potential voter to turn out, no matter who they support for the Senate. But what about the Republican Party's ground-game efforts? Ostensibly such efforts are on behalf of all Republicans, but GOP candidates who don't have the best relationship with Trump don't all trust the RNC to fight on their behalf. So Portman is relying on his own get-out-the-vote effort. Those who have seen recent GOP polling in the state say this is one good reason why: Some 20% of Clinton voters in Ohio say they are planning to vote Republican for Senate.",0.030744337000000004,0.004854369,0.003236246,0.008090615,0.051779935,0.279935275,0.0,2,-1,1
"The North American Free Trade Agreement was first negotiated by President George H.W Bush, but Bill Clinton was in the White House when the deal was finally signed. | Getty Bill Clinton accuses Trump of being ignorant on NAFTA Bill Clinton on Tuesday defended his own economic legacy and accused Donald Trump of being woefully ignorant when it comes to trade deals and keeping jobs in the United States. At an event in Ohio, the former president conceded that not all trade deals have worked. But he went after Trump in a wonkish and detailed manner, especially when it came to one of the examples the Republican nominee singled out during the primetime debate Monday night.

During the debate, Trump called the North American Free Trade Agreement the ?single worst trade agreement ever approve in the country.? The treaty was first negotiated by President George H.W Bush, but Clinton was in the White House when the deal was finally signed. Trump singled out the example of Carrier closing the Indiana plant and shipping jobs to Mexico as one of the reasons the U.S. has been ripped off by the pact. Not so, said Bill Clinton. ?Her opponent blamed NAFTA, butthat not really what happened. You want to know what happened?It really important you understand this, because any president who wants to trade with other countries has got to take this into account.? Clinton said Carrier wanted to break the union in a rush toward profits and in turn blew off an offer from employees to try to save the Midwestern plant from going to Mexico. ?They wanted to break the union, make the money in a hurry and give it to their activist shareholders, we used to call them raiders, and give it to their CEO. So an American president, until we go back to being a stakeholder country, where corporations take account not just their most active shareholders, but their workers, their communities and their customers and their future, we have to be a lot more careful,"" Clinton said.

"The Latvian diplomat said the next U.S. president should stand united with Europe against Russian aggression. | Getty Latvian foreign minister says next U.S. president must combat Russian aggression NEW YORK ? Regardless of who wins this November, the next U.S. president should stand united with Europe against Russian aggression, including Moscow's interference in other countries' elections, Latvia's foreign minister said Monday. EdgarsRink?s' comments to POLITICO come as Americans face two stark choices in the White House race: Republican Donald Trump, who has spoken in friendly terms of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Democrat Hillary Clinton, who has pledged to get tough on the Kremlin.

""The choice of the American people will be made this November,"" he said. ""Whatever that choice is it must be respected."" But he emphasized that U.S. willingness to join Europe in standing up to Russia in recent years through sanctions and other means was a policy that should continue. ""We should understand the kind of values we all share across both sides of the Atlantic are under attack from many actors"" including ""countries that really want to challenge the current state of the world, the revisionist countries,""Rink?s said.

Russia is believed to be quietly supporting far-right parties in some European states, including through financial aid. Kremlin-backed hackers also are suspected of staging digital attacks on the U.S. election infrastructure this year. And Russia's state-supported media clearly favors Trump. Trump has said that, if he's elected, the U.S. may not come to the military aid of Baltic states (Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia) if they are attacked by Russia if the three small countries have not paid their fair share to NATO. The Baltics have protested such comments, saying they are increasing their defense spending and pointing out that a common defense is at the heart of the NATO alliance.

"KALLSTADT, Germany ? Few places in Germany are as representative of thecountry heartland as Kallstadt, the village in which U.S. Republican presidential candidate DonaldTrump grandfather was born ? and from which he was later deported. The hamlet of 1,200 people lies nestled among vineyard-covered hills, about an hour-and-a-half?s drive southwest of Frankfurt. It has one bakery and one butcher. Every year, Kallstadt holds the Saumagenkerwe in celebration of the eponymous local delicacy:pig stomach filled with pork, herbs, bratwurst and diced potatoes. Trump may have captured a large swath of the American electorate with his signature blend of populism, nativism and brazenness. And yet, in the hometown of his forefather, he remains distinctly unpopular. In fact, few politicians are less popular in Germany than Trump. A study by the Pew Research Center found out that only 6 percent of the country finds him trustworthy. Since a local newspaper discovered that Johannes Steiniger, a member of the German parliament, was distantly related to Trump, the 29-year-old has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate. ?With his statements about gay people and foreigners, or with the language he uses, and with his derogative statements about Hillary Clinton, Trump seems to do everything he can so that we get a negative image of him,? Steiniger tells POLITICO.Trump rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities is especially unpopular in Kallstadt. ?He stands for everythingthat bad,? says SarahB, yelling to be heard over the 20-person brass band celebrating the Saumagenkerwe in thetown main square.B is a former local ?wine princess,? the 2009 victor of a beauty pageant to promote the local wine industry. This year, a new dish appeared in thetown annual festival: Saumagen-D?ner, a fusion of the local specialty with a Turkish kebab. ?Everyone is welcome to join us here, no matter what color they are,? saysB. ?Pink, purple,doesn matter.? Tanja Huber, the 24-year-old incumbent regional wine princess, nods her head in agreement. Since the prospect of a Trump presidency first became evident late last year, reporters have descended on Kallstadt, seeking a bit of local color, a quote or two, and perhaps some hometown pride. ?Theydon get that we reallydon give a damn about Trump,? says Huber. ?He?s never been here, and he apparentlydoesn care about us, either.? * * *Donald grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was born in Kallstadt into avintner family on March 14, 1869. Previous generations of the Trump family used variant spellings of the name, including ?Trump,? Dromband ?Trumpff,? according to local historians, or even ?Drumpf,? according to a 2000 family history by Gwenda Blair; but by the time Friedrich was born they had settled on ?Trump.? Germany did not yet exist as a nation; Kallstadt was part of the province of Palatinate in the Bavarian Kingdom. The region was going though rough times. Unemployment was high. Those who had the courage, left.Friedrich father died when he was eight years old, and his mother struggled to make ends meet. At 16 years old, Friedrich decided to follow his sister Katharina, who had emigrated to the United States two years earlier. He arrived in New York on board the Eider on October 19, 1885. He entered the U.S. through official channels, but he had left Bavaria illegally. ?Both he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid a bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service,? said Roland Paul, the recently-retired director of the Institute for Palatinate Regional History and Folklife Studies in the city of Kaiserslautern. According to documents uncovered by Paul, Friedrich was stripped of his Bavarian citizenship ?as his own request? four years after arriving in the U.S. But Friedrich was not done with Palatinate. Seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn, he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister, according to the 2000 family history by Blair. Five years after that, he returned once more to Kallstadt, where he met 20-year-old Elisabeth Christ; they were engaged, and Friedrich came back a third time to marry her in August 1902. But while the couple moved back to New York soon after the marriage and had a daughter, Friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the U.S. and return to the land of their birth. ?My grandmother said, I will marry you, but I will not go back to America with you,? DonaldTrump American-born cousin John Walter told German filmmaker Simone Wendel in 2012. Friedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise. In 1904, he applied for permission to travel to Kallstadt. And although he claimed in his application that he intended ?to return to the United States within a year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein,? he took all his savings from the U.S. with him, according toBlair family history. Back in Kallstadt, Friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back. But though he secured the support of local authorities, the district government put a halt to his plans. On February 27, 1905, a deportation notice was sent to the town office of Kallstadt declaring that Friedrich was ?to be told he has to leave Bavarian state territory by May 1 of this year, at the latest.? Friedrich was able to obtain a three-month grace period because his daughter had fallen ill. But eventually, he and his wife ? pregnant once more ? had no choice but to board the ship Pennsylvania on July 1, 1905, and return to New York. Shortly after that,Donald father, Fred Trump Junior, was born. ?[The authorities] said, ?You are not a German citizen, you gave up your citizenship, you have to leave,? says Walter. ?So they left and they went back to America, andthat why Donald and I are here.? Friedrich ? now named Frederick ? died in May 1918 of the Spanish flu. His widow survived her first husband by 48 years and visited Kallstadt many times during her life. * * * In February 2012, Simone Wendel, the German filmmaker from Kallstadt, was given an audience with Donald Trump. Roughly two years earlier, she had begun work on ?Kings of Kallstadt,? a documentary about the two most famous sons of her tiny hometown: Donald Trump and Henry John Heinz, the inventor of Heinz Ketchup. For months, Wendel had tried to arrange a meeting with Trump, but his office had not replied to her letters. She was only able to secure a visit with the help of Walter,Trump cousin, who had visited Kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history. On the day of her visit, Wendel stood nervously next to Walter in a conference room on one of TrumpTower top floors. She had brought a Linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screw-on tops. Her plan was to sit down with Walter and Trump for coffee and cake, the traditional afternoon snack in her home region. But when she askedTrump staff to make some coffee, the only reaction she got was irritated faces. ?His assistant justcouldn be bothered,? she says. ?Hello, John,? Trump said, when he entered the room, shaking hiscousin hand and looking confused at Wendel in her loose turtle neck and the lonely cake on the huge table in front of her. Trump sat down in front of a one-meter-long model of his Boeing 757-200 airliner and a panoramic window overlooking NewYork Central Park. Wendel, trying to remedy the situation, pushed the cake in his direction and asked him to smell it. ?Afterwards, I just kept on thinking, ?What on earth did I do??? she says. ?The cake looks really good,? Trump said, and he and Wendel ended up talking for almost an hour. Until 1990, Trump still claimed his family was Swedish, a version of his family history first introduced by his father in reaction to the anti-German sentiment in the U.S. during the two World Wars. But by the time Wendel visited, he had become proud of his German roots. ?They grow them well in Kallstadt,? he told her during their meeting. ?They grow them very well. Believe me.It good stock.? ?Wow,it beautiful,? Trump said when she handed him a picture of the house where his grandfather was born, an inconspicuous one-story building with a gable roof. ?That?s fantastic. See how well-maintained it is? Everything is perfectly maintained.It great.? When their interview was over, Walter took Wendel on a tour of Trump Tower. On one of the floors, they ran intoTrump son, Eric Trump. ?Have you ever heard the word Kallstadt?? Wendel asked him. ?Kallstadt?? Trump Junior replied, ?No, what is it??",0.022222222000000003,0.0037037040000000004,0.008333333,0.009259259,0.02962963,0.234259259,0.0,2,-1,1
"KENT,OHIO lonely Hillary supporter stood with a sign outside the rec center at Kent State University on Saturday, a gray and muggy afternoon for a rally. ?INSECURE, SMALL PENISED WHITE GUYS FOR TRUMP!!!? his sign read. Near him, grizzled men in fatigues and sunglasses and a fraternity brother held pro-Trump signs. But the main swirl of activity ahead of Bernie Sanders? speech in this Ohio college town was the dozen fervent Jill Stein supporters, formerly fervent Bernie supporters, holding signs and signing up volunteers. ?We have a better choice,? onesign paint on rumpled printerpaper. ?The two-party system is messed uuuup!? sang Patty Friedrich, a local Green Party organizer, as she pranced around, handing out fliers to people going to the rally. ?Embrace the suuuuuck!? Story Continued Below ?I think our democracy is over after this election,? said Kristyn Nye, who works in marketing. ?Itdoesn matter who wins.? Bernie had opened her eyes, she said, and when he left the race, she was bereft of choice and angered by his speech at the Democratic National Convention in July. ?Heshould just dropped the mic,? Nye said. ?I wish hewould just stuck it to them. What does he have to lose? People in Vermont love him!? After a rally in Akron, Bernie Sanders had arrived in Kent on a mission that might be critical to the election: coaxing disaffected Ohioans not just to vote, but to vote for the woman whomhe been calling corrupt just a few months ago. With Donald Trump moving up in thepolls even, according to some polls, leading in this crucial swingstate Clinton campaign sent in the reinforcements: Bernie Sanders. Hillary for America, which organized the event, was evidently hoping that Sanders, with his anti-establishment appeal and image of fiery authenticity, could bring hisherd maybe a fewstragglers securely into the fold. But it was not clear how well it was working: Nye had internalizedBernie message so fully that she had decided to vote for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate. She was for Jill mostly because she disliked Hillary, who voted for the war in Iraq, is constantly surrounded by scandal and, inNye view, ?doesn?t stand for anything.? She also may or may not haveParkinson. ?But I know a person withParkinson, and Idon know how she would be able to control the shakes,? Nye muses out loud. ?She would have to be on so many drugs thatshe be so out of it, but she seems sharp. How does she do it?? Maybe she justdoesn haveParkinson? I offered. Nye blinked at me, not understanding. ?She?s just so untrustworthy, that I justdon know,? she finally responded. ?Is it pneumonia?? And another thing, Nye said. Clinton wants to start a war with Russia, which she heard on Russia Today. When I pointed out that this was a channel paid for exclusively by the Kremlin, she wondered how that was any different from, say, NPR. Shewasn going to the rally inside the rec center to hear Bernie speak, and neither were the other Bernie diehards there that day. WhyTo hear a man who sold his soul?? said Michele Bline, 54, a disabled veteran of Desert Storm. ?Bernie sold ooouuuut!? sang Friedrich nearby. ?They threatened his familyyy!? ?We?ve heard it all before,? Bline went on. ?We know where he stands,? ?He?s not going to sway me,? a grad student named Gwen West chimed in. Inside, past the humming treadmills and clanging weights, on the far edge of the basketball courts, walled off from the dribblers and dunkers by a wall of semi-transparent white netting, Sanders stood slouching over the lectern, his rumpled pants falling on clunky black shoes, holding forth to a crowd of about 300. A Sanders rally of yore this was not. Earlier that day in Akron, only about 150 came out to hear the old prophet of political revolution. Here, he tried to fulfill his promise to do whatever he could to prevent Trump from being president. To cheers and finger snaps, he talked about theman bigotry and ?the so-called Bertha movement.? ?Now let me be very clear about what the Bertha movement really is,? he went on in his Brooklyn accent about the faux controversy Trump spawned aboutObama provenance. ?It?s not about disagreeing withObama can disagree any time you want. What they were trying to do, led by Donald Trump, is to delegitimize the presidency of the first black president we have ever had. ... What an outrage! What a racist attack!? ?This is an enormously, enormously, enormously important election,? he pressed on, the crowd beaming up at him. ?And for those of your friends who say, ?Well, Idon like anybody,I not going to vote? ... ask your friends why the Koch brothers are spending hundreds of millions of dollars if this election is not important.? It took him a while to get around to saying it, but he did: ?Hillary Clinton believes as I believe? that the minimum wage must be raised, that women should control their own bodies, that ?our gay brothers and sisters have the right to get married.? ?You have to do everything you can to make sure that Secretary Clinton and [Democratic Senate candidate] Ted Strickland win in this state!? Afterward, he was mobbed for handshakes and selfies. ?Did you get to shake his hand?? Lorie Sewell, a local teacher, asked her husband Jim. ?Twice!? Jim grinned. They had voted for Bernie in the primaries and were still fans, but, said Jim, who teaches at Kent State, ?there was no convincing necessary? to get them to support Clinton. He went on, ?Wewould rather voted for Bernie, but the choice is pretty darn clear.? Three freshmen, Samantha, Quincy and Molly, were exhilarated by the various media interviews they had given after the rally, and theirparents was parents?weekend patiently until they could get a bite to eat. The girls were all ardent Berniesupporters one of their dads was,too they liked Clinton fine, too. Their parents had supported her, and it was a natural switch for them. ?I was always going to vote for Hillary if Berniedidn win,? Samantha said. Nearby, three young female students, two of them black, told me they had voted for Bernie but were willing to support Hillary in order to keep Trump from beingelected, one of them laughed, would usher in ?World War 17.? Theyweren huge fans of Hillary and her sketchyhistory, but they understood the stakes andSanders lobbying for her was compelling. ?Bernie?s supporting her,? Kelyanne, a junior, said, ?so there must be a side of herthat good that we justdon see.? There was a small commotion in thewings student volunteers were meeting privately with Bernie, who thanked them for their support and took a group photo with them. Afterward, two of them, both College Democrats who had voted for Bernie in the primaries, gushed about that moment. ?He had his hand on his shoulder!? Brian DiPaolo said, pointing to his comrade Anthony Erhardt. They still loved Bernie, but the switchhadn been wrenching for them either. ?I was never a Bernie-or-Buster,? said Erhardt. ?It was not hard? to watch Bernie concede in Philadelphia and pass the baton to Clinton. ?It was a celebratory moment,? he said. There are still some things on which Erhardt disagreed with Clinton, but ultimately, he said, ?the pros outweigh the cons.? ?I?m voting for her becauseshe more qualified,? DiPaolo said matter-of-factly, clearly proud of the maturity of his reasoning. ?I like to say thatwe not selling out,we buying in.? Sure, they had some friends who were holding out and planning on sitting out theelection the students I talked todid they justhadn bothered to even come see Bernie that afternoon. This struck them all as selfishand ?self-centered? and the people outside, the Jill Stein supporters, are ?just doing harm toBernie image.? Or, as Erhardt put it, ?I love Bernie, I still do.

"Trump adviser denies climate change is manmade Donald Trump believes that ""global warming is naturally occurring"" and humans are not the cause, his campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Tuesday morning on CNN ? a stance that flies in the face of the vast majority of mainstream climate science. Conway was trying to walk back the Manhattan billionaire's previous dismissals of climate change as a ""hoax"" driven by China. But while her remarks Tuesday might seem less extreme on the surface, they still did nothing to assuage climate activists' fears that a President Trump would attempt to bring a wrecking ball to the Obama administration's efforts to head off the most catastrophic effects of global warming. Story Continued Below ""He doesn't believe it's manmade,"" CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota said to Conway, referring to climate change. ""Correct,"" Conway responded. Camerota suggested: ""So he believes the idea that it's manmade is a hoax."" ""No, I didn't say that,"" Conway said. The Sierra Club tweeted afterward: ""Trump's campaign manager confirmed this morning that he doesn't understand science."" Hillary Clinton had drawn attention to Trump's beliefs on climate science during Monday night's presidential debate, saying, ?Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.? Trump interrupted to reply that ?I did not, I do not say that."" But in fact, Trump has repeatedly made such remarks on Twitter, writing in 2012 that ?the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.? And in 2013, he posted that ?Ice storm rolls from Texas to Tennessee ? I'm in Los Angeles and it's freezing. Global warming is a total, and very expensive, hoax!? Presented with those posts Tuesday morning, Conway said Trump believes ?that climate change is naturally occurring, that there are shifts naturally occurring,? but added that the GOP nominee does not believe that those shifts are manmade. The vast majority of scientists disagree, saying carbon emissions from power plants, automobiles, agriculture and other human activities are driving climate change, although natural factors have an effect as well. Conservatives often explain their opposition to cutting U.S. emissions by claiming nonetheless that global warming is an entirely natural phenomenon, even if they sometimes argue that warming has halted or is cyclical. Conway also dismissed the notion that it is possible to graspTrump policy positions, be they on climate change or his stance on the U.S. invasion of Iraq, from the non-traditional media he wields so frequently. ?I think that's based on a tweet,? Conway said when asked aboutTrump previous statements that climate change is a hoax. ?I just love that, that this whole man, whether he's giving a, ?Yeah, I guess so,? answer to Howard Stern about invading Iraq as a private citizen on an entertainment radio show, or through a tweet, we're supposed to understand all of his policies.? However, Trump also described climate change as ""a hoax"" and ""a money-making industry"" at a December rally in South Carolina, during his run for president. Later, Conway suggested that it is Clinton, not Trump, who has been unclear on the issue of climate change. ?We don't know what Hillary Clinton believes because nobody ever asks her,? Conway said, to which Camerota replied that the former secretary of state had addressed the issue quite clearly at Mondaynight debate. Clinton also has repeatedly promoted her climate change agenda on the campaign trail. ?Oh, she gave us the canned, scripted responses, Alisyn, about ?Somebody's going to be the clean energy super power,?? Conway said. ?Look, I can't blame her. She obviously was overprepared and wanted to make sure we heard every single scripted moment, including the snarky ones that she had prepared to say.? GOP vice presidential candidate Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, in a separate CNN interview, tried to recast his running mate's hoax comments as aimed at the notion ""that bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., can control the climate of the Earth,"" and he blasted the Obama administration's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And Pence also broke from both Trump's stance and the earlier comments from Conway in acknowledging that human activity was changing the climate. ""Well, look, there's no question that the activities that take place in this country and in countries around the world have some impact on the environment and some impact on climate,"" he said.

"Washington  Russia might be behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee, according to US officials and lawmakers -- but not Donald Trump. The Republican presidential nominee came up with many alternative possibilities at the first general election debate on Monday night. ""It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people,"" he said during the first presidential debate. ""It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds."" He also devoted a portion of his answer about cyberattacks to the precociousness of his 10-year-old son. ""So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is a huge problem. I have a son. He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly doable,"" he said. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said maybe Trump is confused about where the hacker's ""bed"" lies. ""My guess is if this guy weighs 400 pounds he's sitting somewhere in Russia right now,"" Schiff told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room"" Tuesday. ""I just find this, like his statements about ISIS that played into Russian propaganda, really deplorable."" And cyber experts say the remarks seem unaware of the seriousness of the threat. ""I was pretty surprised during the debate -- there is no ambiguity here,"" former Obama administration cybersecurity official Chris Finan said. ""Everybody knows who did it. So to suggest it was an individual -- and the other thing is -- these intrusion sets are fairly sophisticated,"" said Finan, now CEO at Manifold Technology. ""To say it was an individual or lone actor or small group, that to me shows a lack of appreciation about the threat and how sophisticated and pernicious it is."" So how on-target was Trump with his cybersecurity comments? Here are some expert perspectives. Could a 400-pound hacker have pulled the DNC breach off? The short answer is no, said Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm that investigated and responded to the hack of the DNC. It's nearly impossible to know any hacker's weight. But one thing that is clear to experts like Alperovitch is that government-backed hackers are well-staffed and well-resourced, using very particular software, break-in tactics and cover-up techniques that act as a signature of each group. In the case of the DNC, CrowdStrike discovered two groups inside the system, working unbeknownst to the other, which are well-known as Russian-linked hacking operations and have breached dozens or even hundreds of high-value targets like government agencies, high-level officials' offices and think tanks. Alperovitch said it was ""pretty unlikely"" an individual could have mimicked all the various ways that these groups are distinct, from the software to the ""tradecraft."" Let alone the other targets bearing the same signatures. There has been some official talk of Russian involvement, hasn't there? US officials have only pointed at Russia anonymously, not wanting to ruffle the delicate Moscow-Washington relationship at this point.o But US officials from President Barack Obama on down have warned about Russia efforts to interfere in the election through hacking. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has been one of the more forward-leaning. ""They see a US conspiracy behind every bush,"" Clapper said a few weeks ago when asked if the Russians wanted to disrupt the presidential vote. ""They believe that we are trying to influence political developments in Russia, and so their natural response is to retaliate."" Could an individual hacker still do damage? Most definitely. Beyond Russia and other nation-state attackers and financially motivated criminal operators, often organized in mafia-like gangs, there are also lone-wolf hackers. Experts divide them into categories like ""hacktivists"" and ""script kiddies,"" opportunistic hackers motivated by notoriety or fame. Examples include Guccifer, a now-convicted Romanian hacker who recently pleaded guilty to hacking the accounts of the family of President George W. Bush and former Secretary of State Colin Powell. (A character claiming credit for the DNC hack surfaced online going by ""Guccifer 2.0,"" but Alperovitch said that was just an attempt to divert suspicion from the Russians as the Guccifer redux"" has been proven to not natively speak Romanian."") In another case, two North Carolina men were arrested for allegedly breaking into the email accounts of CIA Director John Brennan and National Intelligence Director James Clapper. How do individuals go about their hacking? While carrying out an attack the level of the DNC hack requires skill and manpower that individuals don't possess, attacks like breaking a few email accounts is within the realm of a single hacker. Often the perpetrators use what's known as social engineering -- gathering clues about a person from their public life online and then using it to guess passwords or security questions to get into accounts and release the contents online. But that's still probably beyond the abilities of most 10-year-olds.",0.036666667,0.006666666999999999,0.005,0.023333332999999998,0.053333333,0.246666667,0.0,2,-1,1

Obama said. ?My hope is that as people are seeingwhat happened in Tulsa or Charlotte on television, and perhaps are less familiar with not only the history of the African-American experience but also how recent some of these challenges have been, upon visiting the museum may step back and say: ?I understand. I sympathize. I empathize. I can see why folks might feel angry, and I wanna be part of the solution, as opposed to resisting change.??Obama references to Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina, highlight the most recent officer-involved shootings of black men that have captured thenation attention.

Obama, flanked by first lady Michelle Obama and themuseum director, Lonnie Bunch, used a sampling of letters he said he read on Thursday to illustrate the divide among Americans when it comes to policing and talks of racial bias. ?I?d say about half of them said, ?Mr. President, why are you always against police, and whyaren you doing enough to deal with these rioters and the violence??? he said. ?And then the other half were some black folks [who] said, ?Mr. President, whyaren you doing something about the police, and when are we actually gonna get justice?? And I understand the nature of that argument because this is a dialoguewe been having for 400 years.? A key challenge Obama cited in ?generating a constructive discussion about how to solve these problems? is rhetoric on TV and the radiothat ?bereft of context and ignores history.? ?So people are just responding as if none ofwhat represented in this museum ever happened,? Obama said, ?adding, ?That?s true for all of us, not just some of us.? ?My hope is, is that this, this complicated, difficult, sometimes harrowing but I believe ultimately triumphant story, will help us talk to each other,? he continued. ?And more important, listen to each other.

"Ifyou spent much time on social media, you might notice that almost regardless of the subject, a string of anti-Hillary memes seems to just automatically show up.That not a coincidence.It all part of a highly coordinated shitpostingdesigned by billionaire and Oculus founder, 24-year-old Palmer Luckey. Luckey is best known as a boy genius who invented his version of virtual reality goggles, called the Oculus Rift. Facebook boughtLuckey company in 2014 for $2 billion. Forbes estimates thathe worth about $700 million. The epicenter of his trolling seems to come from Reddit, where he uses the pseudonym ?NimbleRichMan.? Luckey is a backer, likely the key backer of a pro-Trump 501(c)(4) charitable ?social welfare? organizationthat dedicated to backing Trump. If you think that sounds seriously sketchy,you be right. According to the IRS, a 501(c)(4) is not supposed to have politics as its primary activity, and any politicking it does is not tax exempt. The Daily Beast published an expose on Thursday, which says in part: Nimble America saysit dedicated to proving that ?shitposting is powerful and meme magic is real,? according to thecompany introductory statement, and has taken credit for a billboard its founders say was posted outside of Pittsburgh with a cartoonishly large image ofClinton face alongside the words ?Too Big to Jail.? ?We conquered Reddit and drive narrative on social media, conquered the [mainstream media], nowit time to get our most delicious memes in front of Americans whether they like it or not,? a representative for the group wrote in an introductory post on Reddit. People on Redditaren happy. In fact, the biggest pro-Trump subreddit, r/The_Donald, refused to believe that Luckey was NimbleRichMan, but Luckey insisted thathe just the money behind the idea and well, he did it for a lark ? because, you know, screwing with the future of the free world is fun! ?I?ve got plenty of money,? Luckey added. ?Money is not my issue. I thought it sounded like a real jolly good time.? He prides himself on putting out memes that are so bad that even the Trump campaignwouldn promote them. Before you thinkhe a Millennial who is still angry that Bernie Sandersdidn win, think again. He has zero problems with money in politics. ?The American Revolution was funded by wealthy individuals,? NimbleRichMan wrote on Saturday. Luckey confirmed to The Daily Beast he penned the posts under his Reddit pseudonym. ?The same has been true of many movements for freedom in history. Youcan fight the American elite without serious firepower. They will outspend you and destroy you by any and all means.?

" The WashingtonPost intrepid reporter DavidFahrenthold investigation into the Trump Foundation and the finances of Republican nominee Donald Trump have found yet another instance of foul play by the avaricious real estate mogul. It turns out that Trump has been using his tax-exempt charitable foundation as a vehicle for tax evasion by having companies that owe his money funnel it through the Foundation, allowing him to dodge the taxes on nearly $2.3 million in income. For instance, the Trump Foundation received payments ?totaling nearly $1.9 million from a man in New York City who sells sought-after tickets and one-of-a-kind experiences to wealthy clients.? Anonymous sources within the Trump organization indicate that the man, Richard Ebers, was instructed to pay Trump for goods and services to the Foundation instead. This helps explain why people kept on donatingto the Trump Foundation after it became clear that not even the man it was named after cared enough to put any money into it ? his last donation was in 2008. Senior Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn said that ?what Trump did was provide a service, renounce any fees, and then merely suggestthat the other party make a donation to a charity of their choosing.? Which is the exact definition of shady business dealing. The Head of the Internal RevenueService non-profit watchdog agency, apparently extremely negligent in his monitoring of the Trump Foundation, was absolutely dumbfounded by whatFahrenthold investigation is uncovering. ?This is so bizarre, this laundry list of issues.It the first timeI ever seen this, andI been doing this for 25 years in the IRS, and 40 years total? said Marc Owens. It is absolutely clear that Trump is violating the rules surrounding tax-exempt foundations, rules that were written to stop this exact kind of dishonest money laundering. The consequences of those violations bring monetary penalties, the loss of tax-exempt status, and possibly ? ifwe lucky ? criminal charges. Trump has claimed innocence when queried on the issue. ?Are you confident that the Trump Foundation has followed all charitable rules and laws??asked journalist Sharyl Attkisson. ?Well, I hopeso mean, my lawyers do it? shrugged the Republican nominee. The Trump Foundation has no paid staff, let alone lawyers, so draw your own conclusions from that. It is absolutely astonishing that the Trump campaign would have the nerve to go after the Clinton Foundation when his own charityis literally a money-laundering organization that is being used to perpetrate tax fraud, pay political bribes to unscrupulous Republican politicians investigating his other fraudulent businesses, and purchase $10,000 paintings of himself. The polar opposite of charitable, DonaldTrump greedy schemes border on the comical in their pervasiveness and extension. Corruption is his modus operandi, and we cannot allow him to turn our nation into a giant kleptocracy.

"Demonstrators against the arrival of refugees stand guarded by policemen near a refugees camp on August 22, 2015 in Heidenau, Germany | Matthias Rietschel/Getty Images Hate crime ?threatens peace? in eastern Germany: report Violence against foreigners in the region peaked in 2015, the report said. Violent acts targeting foreigners and migrants have sharply risen in the eastern part of Germany in recent years, the German government warned in a report to be published on October 3, marking thecountry national unity day. The report cites ?countless attacks on refugees and their shelters? in the past year as well as outbursts of violence in Heidenau and Freital, two cities located near Dresden in the state of Saxony. Such attacks are ?symbols of a growing hate of foreigners.? Excerpts of the report were published on Wednesday in the Handelsblatt newspaper after the business daily obtained a copy of it. The ?worrying trend? could ?threaten the peace of the Eastern German society,? said Iris Gleicke according to Handelsblatt. Gleicke is a member of the government in charge of thecountry former Eastern bloc that was under communist rule. Areas in former East Germany remain poorer than former West Germany, with a GDP about a quarter lower than in the West, the report said, adding that differences have largely disappeared since the reunification in 1990. According to statistics, hate crime in the East is well above the rest of the country. In the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where the far-right Alternative for Germany registered an unprecedented electoral success earlier this month, attacks on foreigners and migrants reached 58.7 per million inhabitants. The average for the western part of the country is 10.5, according to Handelsblatt. Authorities started tracking violence against foreigners in 2001. It reached its peak in 2015, according to the report. The report also warned that far-right groups have been gaining strength from rising hatred against foreigners, saying that one such terror organization known as the National Socialist Underground has killed 10 people in recent years. The report noted that there are fewer foreigners in eastern Germany than in other parts of the country, underlining the fact that violence and hatred are not the result of the influx of migrants, but rather due to emigration from the East to other, richer parts of the country and a lack of social structures. The report also noted an increase in violent incidents from left-wing radicals in the former East. Left-wing militants ?misuse demonstrations [against the far-right] and committed a number of criminal acts, sometimes associated with extreme violence, especially against the police,? it said.",0.056105611,0.00990099,0.0,0.00660066,0.08250825099999999,0.32673267300000003,0.00990099,1,-1,1
"That DonaldTrump campaign has had more returns from the dead than a soap opera villain is hardly a novel observation. What is noteworthy is the manner in whichhe bounced back. Time and again, Trump has survived what only a few years ago would have been considered career-endinggaffes calling women ?pigs,? to boasting about his sexual prowess, to repeatedly insulting war heroes, to offending Mexicans during his off-the-cuff announcement speech, to misspelling basic vocabulary words like lightweightand honoron his Twitter feed. This is a man, after all, who forged his political identity by questioning loudly, without any real evidence, on multiple occasions, and in defiance of every rule of politics, the place of PresidentObama birth. And yet here hestands or two battleground states away from the White House. This defies all the rules of public life aswe come to understand them. For decades, a single spontaneous outburst (JohnKerry ?I was for it before I was against it?), a pompous proclamation (whatever Al Gore intended to say about his role in the Internet), a cuckoo pronouncement (GeorgeRomney claim to have been brainwashedabout the Vietnam War), or even an embarrassing misspelling (DanQuayle infamous attempt to correctly write the word potatoon a blackboard), caused irreparable, often campaign-ending damage. Trump has done all thesethings of them multiple times in the same day. The gaffehasn destroyed Trump;it made him stronger. The reasons for this are instructive, and they will change the way politics is practiced forever. Story Continued Below At one level,Trump survival, so far, is less a testament to hisshrewdness it is a disservice to claim hehasn beenshrewd it is toWashington studied cowardice. Trump is not only making gaffes,he brashly owning them, daring the political gods to smite him in what has become an epic rebuke to the dull, predictable, cautious political culture that everyone outside the Beltway has learned to recognize and abhor. In terror of the gaffe, candidates have increasingly immersed their true selves behind carefully vetted talking points, anodyne scripts, and cynical consultants, all with the primary purpose of suffocating in its cradle anything approaching a cavalier statement, never mind a surprising or provocative thought. The culmination of this effort is before us: the enthusiasm-starved campaign of Hillary Clinton, who over her decades in politics has perfected the talent of making even the most cutting-edge idea immediately sound like a cliche. Set against this apotheosis of safe, gaffe-free politics, millions have delightedly embraced a man who seems to recognize their appetite for something recognizably real, even ifit vulgar and offensive. His gaffesaren a sideshow:they integral to his pitch. For this cohort, a vote for Trump is a vote to make the safe, protected, consultant-scripted lives of everyone in D.C. miserable every single day, becausethey earned it. The larger explanation for the Trump phenomenon is even more unsettling forWashington political class, especially the media. They have lost their power. Only a decade or two ago, the media world was confined to a group of people in D.C. and NewYork group that largely knew each other, mingled in the same places, vacationed in the same locales. The most influential members of the group routinely defined what constituted a gaffe, others echoed that view, and it became the conventional wisdom for the rest of America. In the age of the Internet, with bloggers spread out across the nation, and multiple platforms across the political spectrum,that no longer possible. The growing divergence between these insidersand the new outsidershas played toTrump benefit, every single time he made what was once conceived as a ?game-changing? error. The first test of this new dynamic arrived on Trump Day One, when the candidate tossed aside a prepared announcement speech that would have made him sound, well, normal, in favor of a stream-of-consciousness ramble that began with an anecdote about candidates ?sweating like dogs,? who were somehow incapable of beating ISIS to claiming that Mexico, in some diabolical frenzy, was shipping rapists and ax murderers to America by the dozens. Commenting that ?the U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems,? he quickly trained his ire on the influx of illegal immigrants across the Mexican border. He claimed that Mexico, presumably the government of Mexico, was ?sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.? Most candidates, of course, know as a general rule thatit rarely a good idea to include the name of an ethnic group and the word rapistsin the same sentence. Trump eitherdidn know this rule,didn appreciate what he was saying in the midst of a full ramble, ordidn care. The insidermedia went to work, claiming that Trump had insulted not only all Mexicans, but all immigrants. (This was an exaggeration.) Boycotts ensued. Trump lost his deals withMacy and NBC. The outsiderview was very different. Time and again, Republican voters have told their political leaders that illegal immigration was a major concern. The issue led to a rare uprising against George W. Bush during his second term when he pushed what many of his base considered ?amnesty,? almost derailed JohnMcCain presidential campaign in 2008, and haunted Marco Rubio throughout 2016. But most GOP leaders, believing ?comprehensive immigration reform? was the key to attracting Hispanic voters,didn get it. They ignored their core voters on the issue. Trump sounded as perplexed and angry as they were. What he saidwasn a gaffe, not to them. It showed he waslistening skill Washington lost many election cycles ago. This pattern has repeated itself ever since. If you were a campaign consultant looking to the future, it would be worth studyingTrump ?gaffes??not to avoid them, but to figure out just why they work so well. If you list them and pick them apart, you could start to see them as a playbook for a new kind of anti-Washington politics, one in which the candidate speaks right past the old insideraudience of media and Beltway elites, and delivers an outsider electorate exactly what it had been waiting to hear.Here how it works, in three examples: 1. Ben Carson the PsychopathOn the campaign trial, Trump cites BenCarson acclaimed memoir, which discussesCarson violent temper during his youth. (Carson is currently threateningTrump front-runner status in polls.) ?It's in the book that he's got a pathological temper,"" Trump tells an interviewer. ""That's a big problem because you don't cure that ... as an example: child molesting. You don't cure these people. You don't cure a child molester. There's no cure for it. Pathological, there's no cure for that."" Insider: Trump destroys himself and permanently alienates Carson and his supporters by comparing Carson to a child molester. (Which Trump, arguably,didn exactly do.) Outsider: Trump is a fighter, willing to useCarson own words directly against him. The media does this to politicians all the time.What the big deal? Outcome: Trump overtakes Carson in polls. Carson ultimately forgives Trump, endorses him for president and serves as a surrogate forhim when Carson needs to find his luggage. TRUMP WIN 2. McCain the CapturedWar Hero At an Iowa event in June 2015, Trump outrageously questions JohnMcCain war hero status (after McCain went after Trump supporters as ?crazies.?) ?He?s not a war hero,? said Trump, before immediately reversing himself. ?He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people whoweren captured.? Insider View: We all know JohnMcCain guy, war hero, very quotable. Who in their right mind would take on a POW who endured torture for more than five years in hisnation service, especially a guy who never served in uniform himself? Proof positive thatTrump nuts. Outsider View: Trump probably went too far on this, but many of usdon like amnesty-supporting McCain all that much anyway. Besides, McCain was taking cracks at Trump. Whyshouldn he respond? Outcome: Eventually, after much resistance, Trump quasi-apologizes by claiming hedidn say what he obviously meant to say. McCain endorses Trump for the presidency. TRUMP WIN 3. Bush the Warmonger Fresh off of his victory in New Hampshire, Trump heads to South Carolina, the alleged Bush firewallwhere his brother, George W. Bush, is going to campaign for his brother Jeb. During a televised debate in the veteran-thick state, Trump says W. liedabout weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in order to go to war: ?They said there were weapons of mass destruction, there were none. And they knew there were none.? He is greeted with boos from the audience. Insiders: South Carolina veterans will not forgive Trump for insulting the Bushes or repeating theleft claims that Bush lied the country into war.We been assured all year long by Bush campaign people that Jeb was going to win in South Carolina, a state with nostalgic love for the Bushes. Trump made a huge miscalculation with his latest outburst. Outsiders: The Bushes areyesterday news. And, come to think of it, why did we go into Iraq? Outcome: Trump wins the South Carolina primary by about 10 points. Bush comes in fourth and drops out of the race. TRUMP WIN Care to continue? Ididn think so. And I stillhaven gotten to how Trump wondered aloud whether TedCruz dad may have been in or near the grassy knoll the day of the Kennedyassassination toTrump brilliant response when called on his epic troll: ?Theydidn deny it.? By the time Trump gaffed his way to the Republican nomination, furious and frustrated media outlets had been grappling for months with how to hold him to account, asthey managed with other candidates in the past. A journalist asked Trump to identify the ?five sources? that he claimed had told him Mexico was deliberately sending criminals across our border. The brilliance, of course, was in the number. Not one. Not two. But five people. Who would make up a number like that? In any event, Trump refused to disclose their names. Were they business colleagues? Informants from the Mexican government? Did all of them have the last name Trump?We left to wonder. Most peopledidn seem to care.He probably making it up, they think, but whatever. Multiple Web pages and assorted news articles have devoted themselves to chroniclingTrump habit of making an outrageous statement, and then later denying such statement was ever made. Examples abound: that Marco Rubio was the personal senator for Mark Zuckerberg, that the pro-free-market Trump had supported health care mandates, that he ever told supporters to ?knock the crap? out of protesters, after some did just that.Trump infuriating ability to wiggle out of all sorts of statements has left fact-checkers?who have labeled him among the biggest fibbers in recent politicalhistory a state of distress. After all, a decades-long pattern of denying clear and unequivocal statements is the kind of audacity usually reserved for the Clintons. Which, come to think of it, may be whyTrump dalliances with deceptionhasn seem to outrage people whodon work in the media. The latest effort is the Instant FactCheck which cable news channels, such as CNN, note in real-time whether a candidate is making a truthful claim, as in ?Trump (falsely) claims X.? Onedoesn get the impression that these instantfact-checks have been applied quite so forcefully to Hillary Clinton. And this, too, seems to have blown up in their collective faces, signaling to outsiders that the mainstream media, as they suspected, is just in the tank for the Democrats. In the years-long battle between Trump and his Javert-like media interlocutors, nothing has led to more perfectly justified hysteria than his pirouette over the Obama birther business. As far as conspiracy theories go, the rock-solid contention that Barack Obama was not born in the United States was always of the nonsensical variety. After all, even if he had been born someplace else, no fault of his own, the president still would have been born to an American citizen, his mother. That alone would qualify him for the presidency, just as much as it does Cruz, or McCain, or George Romney (all of whom were not born in the U.S.) But the dark and daffy corners of the so-called alt-right is no place for logic. Last week, as he began passing Clinton in many polls, Trump seemed to have fallen prey to the birthergaffe again by refusing to say whether he believed the president was born in the United States. Media outlets could not believe theirluck was stepping into it again. Or was he? At a news conference devoted to promoting his new D.C. hotel, Trump finally announced his (latest) position: ?Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period.? This was Trump at his most fiendish. Not only had he repudiated his own long history as a ?birther,? not only had he lured the national news media into giving wall-to-wall coverage of a hotel opening, he blamed his opponent for the whole thing. No other activity in recent political history engendered as much of an outcry from the insider media, with the possible exception of SarahPalin nomination for the vice presidency of the United States. To the insiders, no single moment in the campaign was more appalling, or revealing ofTrump singular mendacity. His pirouette not only made fools of the press by getting them to cover an infomercial disguised as a news conference, it was a brazen effort to shift blame for a controversy that Trump did more than any other prominent American to promote. Surely, the press assumed, the public would see this? They saw it, allright not in the same way. To an outsider, a savvy businessman had just engineered a brilliant ad for his latest venture, while efficiently backing away from a controversy he probablydidn take all that seriously anyway. And as he did it, he left the media caught just a bit in a trap of its own. As they rushed to attack Trump on his latest ?lie,? most outlets conveniently omitted to mention that in fact there was some truth inTrump contention. The Clinton campaign may not have startedthe birther controversy. But it was circulated by her supporters, and Clinton world definitely had a hand in it. According to a former editor with the McClatchy News Service, one ofClinton closest confidants, Sidney Blumenthal, personally spread the birtherstory himself. (Blumenthal flatly calls this ?false,? leaving the story in ?his word against mine? territory.) What an unbiased observer might conclude from all of this is that many mainstream media outlets, so blinded in their distaste for Trump and so determined to unmask him as an unprecedented liar, have now compromised themselves in the process. Which is one more lesson from the Trump playbook: If you make enough gaffes, pretty soon your crazed critics will start making gaffes of their own.

"Kaine to Trump on debate: 'You can run but you can't hide' LAKELAND, Fla. ? In a bruising pre-debate series of attacks, Tim Kaine compared Donald Trump unfavorably to Richard Nixon, suggested Trump pays little in taxes and said Hillary Clinton will do ?very well? as Trump struggles with the truth. About eight hours before Clinton and Trump take the stage in Hempstead, N.Y., Kaine predicted Trump will crumble when confronted with any questions that touch specific policy areas. Story Continued Below ?You can run but youcan hide.We going to see tonight: Can he give any details about anything? Can he answer questions like:where your tax return?? Kaine said, noting that presidents since Nixon have released their returns. ?If youcan be as ethical as Richard Nixon, folks, I mean come on.? At the airport in Lakeland, Kaine was greeted by Michael Phillips, a campaign volunteer with a disability who works on technology to allow people with disabilities to better communicate. Kaine read aloud a note from Phillips at a rally in this Central Florida town about an hour later, quoting Phillips as saying: ?I?ve been waiting my entire life for a candidate like you and Secretary Clinton.? Kaine then held up a copy ofTrump recent book, titled ?Crippled America.? Phillips ?has a severe disability. He said, ?That?s not limiting me,?? Kaine recounted. ?Donald Trump has a very different vision.? While Kaine repeated many familiar attacks on Trump as a poor steward of the military for his rhetoric aimed at the likes of Sen. John McCain and Khizr Khan, he also dinged Trump for promoting ?stop and frisk? policies while tensions between police and black Americans persist in places like Charlotte and Minnesota, saying it would ?widen the gap? between police and the community. Kaine spent most of his pre-debate comments on Trump and questioned his relationship with facts as a partisan argument rages over whether moderator Lester Holt should fact-check the debate. ?Donald Trump thinks he can get this over on you,? Kaine said. ?He?s got to answer the questions. And the last thing we get to see [at the debate] about Donald Trump is whether he can tell the truth.? Kaine did predict Clinton will do ?very well? on Monday, a bit more cautious than his ?A-plus? prediction at a rally Sunday night in the Miami area. And he saidhe be doing his homework in preparation for the debate of his own in eight days in Farmville, Va. ?I?m real interested in this debate.

" Hillary Clinton forced Donald Trump onto defense over his temperament, refusal to release his taxes and his past comments about race and women during a fiery debut presidential debate Monday -- a potentially pivotal moment in a tight election campaign. Clinton, who has seen her dominance of the presidential race fade in the weeks since the Democratic convention, delivered a strong performance in which she demonstrated a command of policy and a sense of humor, smiling through some of Trump's strongest attacks. She delivered the best zinger of the night in response to criticism from Trump for staying off the campaign trail recently. ""I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,"" she said. ""And yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be President. And that is a good thing."" Trump came out swinging at the beginning of the debate, and made some effective points on the economy and jobs -- some of the aspects of his outsider presidential campaign that have struck a chord with many Americans. But the debate highlighted Trump's tendency to make false claims as he made inaccurate statements on everything from laws regarding policing, his support for the Iraq War and his contention that Clinton was behind the so-called birther conspiracy. Appearing in the ""spin room"" after the debate to talk to journalists, Trump said he was happy with his performance. JUST WATCHED Trump speaks out on taxes, birther movement Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump speaks out on taxes, birther movement 03:19 ""It went better than I ever thought,"" he told CNN's Dana Bash. A CNN/ORC poll of debate watchers released after the event found 62% felt Clinton won compared to 27% for Trump. The poll suggests the debate audience was a bit more Democratic than the public as a whole, about on par with the Democratic tilt in the audience that watched the first debate in 2008 between Obama and John McCain. One of the most powerful moments of the debate came when the conversation focused on the so-called birther debate following Trump's recent acknowledgment that President Barack Obama was born in the US -- a fact that has been evident for years. With Trump standing just a few feet from her, Clinton blasted him for perpetuating a ""racist lie."" ""He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior,"" Clinton said as Trump shook his head. Trump hit back, noting Clinton's tough critiques of Obama during their bitter 2008 primary battle. 'Holier than thou' ""You treated him with terrible disrespect and I watch the way you talk now about how lovely everything is ... it doesn't work that way,"" he said.

Clinton repeatedly sought to correct Trump's statements -- going so far as referring viewers to fact checks on her website -- as she aimed to portray him as out of touch with the complexities of the American economy. ""I know you live in your own reality,"" she told Trump. Clinton and Trump opened the debate on a positive note by shaking hands before stationing themselves behind their podiums at Hofstra University on New York's Long Island.

Campaign at a critical point Trump and Clinton are facing off with the campaign at a critical point, as the race is a dead heat just 43 days before Election Day. A CNN/ORC poll released Monday found Trump edging Clinton 42% to 41% in the crucial battleground state of Colorado among likely voters in a four-way race.

"Donald Trump speaks at the Shale Insight Conference on Sept. 22 in Pittsburgh. | AP Photo Trump blames 'drugs' for Charlotte unrest Thecandidate planned outreach to black voters hit a snag when he went off script to suggest drugs were fueling chaotic protests after a police shooting. PITTSBURGH ? Attempting to strike a unifying, presidential tone while commenting Thursday about urban unrest in Charlotte, Donald Trump veered temporarily off-script and attributed the violence ? without offering any evidence ? to drugs. ""If you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television,"" he said. Story Continued Below Following a night of wall-to-wall cable coverage of the violent protests in response to another police shooting of an African-American man, the Republican presidential nominee aimed to square his law-and-order philosophy with his eleventh-hour outreach efforts to the country's African-American communities. Trump, who trails Hillary Clinton by approximately 80 percent points among African-American voters, explained that his promise to restore order to cities plagued by racial tensions is an effort to protect disproportionately affected minority communities. ""There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration,"" he said at the beginning of remarks to the Shale Insight Convention. ""Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disrupter, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and to get their children a great education. We have to cherish and protect those people."" Trump's stated concern is of a piece with his recent visits to African-American churches in Detroit and Flint and his stumping in Ohio Wednesday with boxing promoter Don King, who vouched for the candidate's character. But his ad-libbed comment blaming drugs for these violent uprisings seemed to validate stereotypes about black communities ? seemingly supporting the criticism that Trump's larger outreach effort to African-American voters is really an attempt to convince moderate Republican women that he isn't a racist. As he often does, Trump praised police officers for risking their lives but acknowledged, as he did on Wednesday, that their judgment in pressure situations is not infallible. ""Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed,"" Trump said. ""But our men and women in blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude. They are the line separating civilization from total chaos.""",0.029801325,0.0,0.009933775,0.006622517,0.059602649,0.324503311,0.006622517,2,-1,1
"If Republicans and Donald Trump really care about our military veterans, they will tell this douchebag to shut the hell up. Ohio GOP Rep. Warren Davidson has outraged the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the House Veterans Affairs Committee by referring to veterans as moocherswho are just pretending to be hurt or sick when they show up to get medical care from the VA. ?Just like workers comp outhere got moochers, I wish that there were no vets that were the same sort of problem on our society,? Davidson said during a town hall event on Monday. ?But part of the problem is there are some vets that are moochers andthey clogging up the system, and we do as taxpayers want to make sure the VA filters out these folks that are pretenders. Just like we wish there were no people out there with stolen valor, butthat a problem in the vet community, too.? Davidson, who won a special election to replace John Boehner and is a supporter of Donald Trump, has drawn a shitstorm of criticism ever since. Veterans of Foreign Wars spokesman Joe Davis slammed Davidson for insulting the men and women who have served this country. ?Honorably discharged veterans with service-connected wounds, illnesses and injuries, or who are indigent due to circumstances beyond their control, are not moochers,? he said in a statement. House Veterans Affairs Committee chairman Jeff Miller said he hopes that Davidson merely misspokeand called upon him to clarify his remarks. AndDavidson remarks are particularly outrageous because Davidson is a veteran himself. But when given the chance to back down, Davidson did the opposite. ?Any effort to suggest I have anything other than asoldier passion for providing our veterans with the care they deserve is dishonest,? he said before his spokesman presented four case of VA fraud to somehow prove his claims that veterans are ?moochers.? The problem is that these cases involve people who pretend to be veterans. In other words, the people in these cases are NOT veterans. But Davidson called veterans moochersanyway. It would have been so simple for Davidson to just clarify his remarks, but hedidn because, like Donald Trump, Republicans are incapable of admitting when they are wrong. SoDavidson insult of veterans stands in the record as a testament to how Republicans really feel about the men and women who fought for our country.

"Trump clarifies stop-and-frisk: I only meant Chicago Donald Trump doubled down on his call for implementation of stop-and-frisk Thursday ? but only in Chicago. The Republican presidential nominee suggested the controversial stop-and-frisk policy to mitigate violent crime inAmerica inner cities during an interview with Fox News? Sean Hannity broadcast Wednesday evening. Story Continued Below On Thursday, he clarified that he was only referring to enacting it in Chicago, where he said more than 3,000 shootings have taken place this year. ?I was really referring to Chicago with stop-and-frisk,? he told ?Fox and Friends? during a phone interview Thursday morning. ?They asked me about Chicago and I was talking about stop-and-frisk for Chicago.? But while Trump scaled down where stop-and-frisk should be deployed, the self-proclaimed law-and-order candidate hardly softened his stance on the policing practice that studies have shown is biased. He cited New York, where a federal court ruled the practice unconstitutional in 2013 because it disproportionately impacts people of color (though an appeals court overturned the ruling, and the city eventually settled), as evidence that it works. ?I mean, the numbers were unbelievably changed,? he said of crime statistics before and after New York implemented stop-and-frisk. ?Idon mean just a little bit. It was massively changed, and it became a safe city. It went from an unsafe city to a safe city.? Trump highlighted Chicago as a citythat ?out of control? right now but where stop-and-frisk is a necessity that can save the city from itself, suggestingit more dangerous to be there than in war-torn nations like Afghanistan. ?I think Chicago needs stop-and-frisk,? Trump said. ?Now, people can criticize me for that or people can say whatever they want, but they asked me about Chicago, and I think stop-and-frisk, with good, strong, you know, good, strong law and order. But you have to do something. Itcan continue the wayit going.?

Trump said. ?They?ll stop,they frisk, andthey take the gun away, and theywon have anything to shoot with. I mean, howit not being used in Chicago is, to be honest with you,it quite unbelievable.

Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a Trump surrogate, hailed the practice as a strategy that reduced crime and is the solution to reducing gun violence. ?Because it takes the gun right out of your hand,? said Giuliani, who added that no one is taking guns away in New York or Chicago ?because bad guysdon go register? guns. ?You know, ?Fat Tony? Salernodoesn go get a gun permit. Neither does the hood on the street go get a permit,? he continued. ?You know why?There probably a warrant for his arrest andhe gonna go to jail. So hedoesn get a permit.? Trump contended that ?youcan let the system go the wayit going,? adding that ?some people? think stop-and-frisk is ?a great idea, and some people probablydon like it? ? New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is of the latter group. De Blasio condemned stop-and-frisk, insisting that it ?created a real wedge between police and community and created division.? De Blasio credited ?a systematic strategic approach to policing,? not stop-and-frisk, for reduced crime in New York. ?You know, Donald Trump talks about stop-and-frisk like he knows the facts. He has had no experience with policing, no experience with public safety,? de Blasio told CNN. ?He should really be careful because if we reinstituted stop-and-frisk all over this country, you would see a lot more tension between police and community.? White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest declined to respond to Trump's comments. ""I think it does raise questions that a politician would be so dogmatic about protecting second amendment rights yet rather cavalier about protecting the constitutional prohibition against an illegal search and seizure,"" he said. ""It might lead one person to conclude that the politician is more interested in playing politics than finding a solution."" But Earnest made sure to note that stop-and-frisk is not the type of practice the administration and its allies support. ""Expanding and doubling down on stop and frisk policies is not among the suggestions, I think for rather obvious reasons.""

"Story highlights The House Oversight panel voted 19-15 to hold Bryan Pagliano in contempt Pagliano failed to show for a second hearing on Clinton's emails and private server Washington (CNN) Members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted along party lines Thursday to hold the architect of Hillary Clinton's private email server in contempt for failing to appear before them. The panel's 19-15 vote came after Bryan Pagliano failed to attend a second hearing on Clinton's emails and use of a private server while leading the State Department. Republicans blasted his decision as an act of defiance, but Pagliano's lawyers said the demand that he appear ""betrays a naked political agenda."" House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, argued that previous testimony from another one of Clinton's IT workers, Justin Cooper, made it imperative for Pagliano to testify. ""I explained Mr. Pagliano was uniquely qualified to provide testimony to help the committee better understand Secretary Clinton's use of a private email server. This is indisputable,"" Chaffetz said. ""I also made clear the committee would consider all options regarding Mr. Pagliano's failure to appear, including consideration of recommending he be held in contempt.""

"2016 Trump presses Clinton on growth of ISIS GOP nominee may be right to blame Obama administration, but undermines his case with dubious assertions. Donald Trump said Hillary Clinton has spent her ?entire adult life? fighting the Islamic State and will never be able to defeat the terrorist group. Clinton retorted that Trump ""has no plan"" to fight the radical group, and put him on the defensive over his past support for the Iraq War. Story Continued Below The foreign policy section of Monday's debate touched on Russia, Iran, and nuclearweapons no subject animated the candidates like their exchanges about the terrorist militia's rise and which candidate is better-equipped to crush it. Repeating a pattern throughout the debate, Trump made his case with bold, and questionable, claims, while Clinton defended her position with less memorable but more factual assertions. With polls showing high voter anxiety over terrorism, Trump took the first shot on the subject early in the debate, with a charge that Clinton's web site had posted details of her war plan. ""You're telling the enemy everything you want to do,"" Trump said. ""No wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life."" That was a head-scratching claim, given that Clinton is 68 and the Syria-based group, also known as ISIS, has only existed in its current form since 2014. (A predecessor group was founded in 2004.) But Clinton ignored Trump's puzzling assertion. ""At least I have a plan to fight ISIS,"" she quipped. Clinton later added that while Trump has claimed he has a ""secret plan"" to fight ISIS, ""the only secret is that he has no plan."" Clinton took more seriously hischarge by many national securityexperts the 2011 U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq had enabled ISIS's creation. ""They wouldn't even have been formed if you left some troops behind, like 10,000, or maybe something more than that,"" Trump said. President Barack Obama oversaw the exit of U.S. troops, which he celebrated at the time. Clinton was then serving as Obama's Secretary of State. But she countered that it was the George W. Bush administration which failed to reach an agreement with Iraq's government that would have allowed U.S. forces to remain in the country on terms acceptable to Washington. ""George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama,"" Clinton said. ""And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq was to get an agreement from the Iraqi government that would have protected ourtroops the Iraqi government would not give that."" Experts have debated that point for years, with some claiming that Obama never really wanted such an agreement and didn't try as hard as he could have to secure one. Yet some some former Obamaofficials the U.S. ambassador to Iraq at the time of the withdrawal, James Jeffrey? say that Clinton argued internally for maintaining a troop presence in the country beyond 2011. ISIS evolved from the group al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), founded in the wake of the 2003 U.S. invasion of that country. The group was nearly wiped out by the U.S. military but regained strength after the American withdrawal, and as it joined the fight in Syria's civil war. In 2014, AQI cut ties to al Qaeda and renamed itself the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, and is often called the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. There is almost no expert support for Trump's longtime insistence, which he repeated Monday, that the U.S. should have seized Iraq's oil fields as a form of war booty, and that doing so would have allowed the U.S. to prevent ISIS's rise. ""Had we taken theoil we should have taken theoil would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income,"" Trump said. Trump has argued for years that the U.S. should commandeer Iraq's oil, though he has not addressed basic questions like how many troops it would take and how the oil would be transported from a country sure to be hostile to the seizure of its most valuable commodity. Nor did Trump ever describe the plan in the past as a way to prevent militants from flourishing, even as many national security experts were doing so. Clinton, who cast a Senate vote to authorize the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2002, sought to turn Trump's talk of Iraq history back against him by citing his well documented comments in favor of the U.S. invasion before it happened. ""Donald supported the invasion of Iraq,"" she said. ""I did not support the war in Iraq. That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her,"" Trump said. Trump proceeded to claim he had ""numerous conversations"" with Fox News host Sean Hannity, in which he opposed the war, but of which there is no public record. The debate's moderator, Lester Holt, endorsed Clinton's version of events. ""The record shows otherwise,"" he told an irritated Trump. As he often has before, Trump again cited an August 2004 interview with Esquire as evidence of his opposition to the war. ""They did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started, I think in ?04, but they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq,"" Trump said. But by that time, more than a thousand American troops had died in Iraq, photos documenting the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal had emerged, and public support for the occupation was falling fast. Clinton reiterated her pledge to ""intensify"" airstrikes against ISIS, enlist technology companies to track down on the group's Internet activities, and support Arab and Kurdish fighters on the ground in Iraq andSyria steps the Obama administration is already taking. Clinton did not repeat her past talk of establishing a ""no-fly zone"" in northern Syria. Clinton also raised the subject of Russia, pressing her campaign's recent charge that Trump is suspiciously respectful of Russian president Vladimir Putin and that he holds Kremlin-friendly views of NATO and Ukraine. ""There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donald is very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin. But Putin is playing a very tough, long game here,"" Clinton said. Defying the strong consensus view of U.S. intelligence officials, Trump cast doubt on Russia's alleged role in the recent hack and exposure of Democratic National Committee emails. ""I don't think anybody knows it was Russia who broke into the DNC. She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia. Maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but It could also be China, but it could also be lots of other people,"" Trump said. ""It also could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?""",0.034897713999999996,0.003610108,0.008423586,0.031287605,0.06979542700000001,0.327316486,0.012033694,2,-1,1

Clinton: ""I really couldn't see or hear very well, so I'm not quite sure what his vows were. But I'm sure they were great and huge and wonderful."" Galifianakis: ""Like his bowels.""

"Story highlights Sen. Joe Donnelly is pushing for the return of US ISIS victims bodies There's a long traditional of the US miliary pushing for such remains (CNN) The fate of several dead American ISIS hostages quietly came back to the forefront at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Thursday when a member asked Defense Secretary Ash Carter to find a way to bring their bodies home. Sen. Joe Donnelly brought the issue up amid growing talk by military commanders about using Kurdish and Arab forces to push ISIS out of Raqqa, the terror group's stronghold in Syria and self-declared capital. The US believes several of the US hostages murdered by ISIS likely were killed in the Raqqa area and their bodies have never been recovered. ""When we go to Raqqa, we lost some young men and women there who were killed by ISIL, and we want to have them come home, "" said Donnelly, an Indiana Democrat, using another word for ISIS.

"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin DelanoRoosevelt infamous line, ?we have nothing to fear but fear itself,? the Pope chastised fear-based media. Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of terrorismand media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of ?terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue?, he said. ?This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.? Source: Reuters Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking toItaly press, which has its own problems with nationalism, butI sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear andthat what has given us Donald Trump. Crime in the nation is down. AnAmerican odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans: Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant.

"President BarackObama rejection of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act was well-foreshadowed. | Getty Obama vetoes Saudi 9/11 bill The White House vetoed legislation on Friday that would allow Saudi Arabia to be sued for any alleged role in the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks ? setting up what is almost certain to be the first veto override of BarackObama presidency.Obama rejection of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act was well-foreshadowed; White House officials have repeatedly said Obama has several objections to the measure, including concerns that U.S. officials would face retaliation in the courts by foreign governments. Story Continued Below In a three-page veto message outlining his objections, Obama again stressed those arguments and others made by his administration in recent days. Particularly problematic, inObama view, was the possibility that courts could end up wading into terrorism issues best left to national security and foreign policy officials. ?This would invite consequential decisions to be made based upon incomplete information and risk having different courts reaching different conclusions about the culpability of individual foreign governments and their role in terrorist activities directed against the United States,? Obama said. That, the president added, ?was neither an effective nor a coordinated way for us to respond to indications that a foreign government might have been behind a terrorist attacks.? Obama again reiterated the WhiteHouse view that the 9/11 bill could lead to retaliation ? which could cause ?potentially seriously financial consequences for the United States,? he warned ? while arguing that the 9/11 bill ?threatens to create complications in our relationships with even our closest partners.? ?I have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, who have suffered grievously,? Obama said in the veto message. ?I also have a deep appreciation of these families? desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts.? But he added that the legislation ?would neither protect Americans form terrorist attacks nor improve the effectiveness of our response to such attacks.? Those arguments have rung hollow for Congress, which passed the legislation unanimously through both chambers. The Senate passed the measure in May, and the House followed suit earlier this month on the eve of the 15th anniversary of the terrorist attacks. The Senate will move first on a veto override because the legislation, written by Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas), originated there. Unless there are objections, the override vote can be set up by unanimous consent. Cornyn called not only the veto ""disappointing,"" but also Obama's ""refusal to listen to the families of the victims taken from us on Sept. 11."" And Schumer called the veto a ?disappointing decision? from Obama that will be ?swiftly and soundly overturned in Congress.? ?If the Saudis did nothing wrong, they should not fear this legislation. If they were culpable in 9/11, they should be held accountable,? Schumer said after Obama officially vetoed the bill. ?The families of the victims of 9/11 deserve their day in court, and justice for those familiesshouldn be thrown overboard because of diplomatic concerns.? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said this week his chamber will vote to override the legislation before lawmakers leave Washington to campaign for reelection. McConnell spokesman David Popp reiterated that on Friday, saying the chamber will take it up ?as soon as practicable in this work period.? And a coalition of survivors of the 9/11 attacks, as well as the family members of the victims, released a statement saying they were ?outraged and dismayed? atObama veto. ?No matter how much the Saudi lobbying and propaganda machine may argue otherwise, JASTA is a narrowly drawn statute that restores longstanding legal principles that have enjoyed bipartisan support for decades,? the group, known as 9/11 Families and Survivors United for Justice Against Terrorism, said. ?It will deter terrorism and hold accountable those nations that support and fund it.? Key backers of the legislation expectObama veto will be easily overridden, considering the unanimous show of support from Capitol Hill. Still, influential national security voices such as Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) have expressed concerns about potential implications of the legislation ? although those sentiments had gained little traction at the Capitol because the bill has such strong support. On Friday, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) began circulating a ""Dear Colleague"" letter urging lawmakers to sustain Obama's veto, echoing many of the administration's objections against the 9/11 bill. ""My primary concern is that this bill increases the risk posed to American military and intelligence personnel, diplomats, and others serving our country around the world,"" Thornberry wrote in the letter circulated among Republican lawmakers. ""Many of us have long resisted any attempt to subject U.S. military, intelligence, and diplomatic personnel to criminal or civil courts around the world. These individuals who are carrying out U.S. policy must be protected. Differences should be resolved between governments based on policies, not by individual litigants in the courts."" Top congressional leaders such as Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) have said they share concerns from the White House about JASTA, asit been known on Capitol Hill. But they also say a veto override is inevitable; Pelosi said Thursday that the White House has not reached out to her to enlistPelosi help in swaying lawmakers to theadministration side. ?I think that members think that the families should have their day in court, and I think the concerns that the President has expressed are very legitimate,? Pelosi said Thursday. ?The families think that they've addressed many of those concerns in the legislation.? The 9/11 bill was a rare point of agreement between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump -- both New Yorkers who each said they would sign the legislation if they were president. The legislation amends the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act to prevent countries involved in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil from invoking sovereign immunity, a legal principle that shields foreign nations from legal action. JASTA has long been viewed as focusing on SaudiArabia alleged role in the terrorist attacks. The so-called ?28 pages,? part of a 2002 probe that was declassified in July, included some indications that appear to suggest links between a handful of Saudis in the United States and two of the 9/11 hijackers.

"Toby Keith has been forced to cancel his show in South Carolina and it was totally unexpected. Toby Keith was scheduled to perform at the Florence Civic Center in South Carolina on September 22 and he was forced to cancel. Unfortunately the night before the concert Toby Keith sent out an update to all of his fans sharing the heartbreaking news. The good news is that Toby Keithdidn have to cancel his concert because he was ill or hurt. The bad news is that there are huge fuel shortages in South Carolina and the gas prices are continuing to rise in the Southeast. The General Manager of the Florence Civic Center,Kendall Wall, shared that the venue had received many messages from fans stating that theyweren going to be able to make it because of the fuel cancern. BothKeith managers and the Florence Civic center decided that it was best for the fans if the concert was postponed to a later date. They wanted it to be fair for everyone who had already purchased their tickets. ?This is a major show for the region which attracts fans within a one- to two-hour drive andbeyond understand the growing concerns forToby fans and our own fans, aswe been receiving distress messages over the past coupledays would be unfair for these fans and unrealistic for them to travel given the current dismal situation with gas prices and availability.? The rescheduled concert date is March 7,2017 and the tickets will be honored for that concert. If any fan is unable to make the rescheduled concert date, there will be refunds made but only for a short amount of time. Toby Keith is one of the most respected country artists and we hope that those fans who could have made the concert are understanding of the cancelation.I glad that everyone is okay, but it is such a bummer that these things have to happen.

"Rep. Andy Harris snagged the endorsement of the founders of the RSC. | AP Photo Conservatives back Freedom Caucus member for top post Republican Study Committee leaders are endorsing Rep. Andy Harris to lead the conservative group in the next Congress, picking the House Freedom Caucus member over freshman Rep. Mark Walker. The RSC's founders, an influential group which consists of current chairman Bill Flores (R-Texas), Rep. Sam Johnson (R-Texas) and previous leaders of the caucus, said while both Harris (R-Md.) and Walker (R-N.C.) are qualified to serve as chairman, Harris? seniority in Congress helped sway the decision. Story Continued Below ?While we determined that both candidates are qualified and would serve as effective chairs of the RSC, we believe thatAndy additional experience from serving three terms as a conservative leader in the House of Representatives and his overall approach to serving his House colleagues will be beneficial to the organization,? the founders wrote in an announcement sent to RSC members obtained by POLITICO. The founders' endorsement comes after some House Freedom Caucus members were threatening to abandon the RSC in recent weeks. The RSC is the largest caucus on Capitol Hill with 178 members, and because of that boasts considerable sway within the Republican conference. The endorsement is signed by all of thegroup founders including Johnson, Flores, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), leader of the House Freedom Caucus, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) and Rep. Rob Woodall (R-Ga.). Walker downplayed the endorsement and made clear he still wants the job.

"The obvious bias in the Crooked Hillary Clinton email investigation which was shown by the now embattled former FBI Director James Comey, his right-hand man Andrew McCabe and the now disgraced bureau agent Peter Strzok who sent over 10k texts to his mistress with messages showing disdain towards Candidate Trump while pledging to not let Crooked Hillary lose the 2016 election, have all made incalculable damage to the federal law enforcementagency reputation. Damage which is unrepairable! Up until now the fall out has gone as far as to implicate the FBI in the now infamous work of fiction which is the Fusion GPS anti-Trump dossier which has led McCabe and James Baker, to either announce early retirements or to be reassigned. However now, someone has already been killed over this very controversial move andthere only one person who had this particularly damning information on Hillary. She thought he was long gone and that she had gotten away with murder, yet again, but her worst nightmare just surfaced. Looks like one of the biggest and most recent ?sudden death? mysteries may have just been solved. Fox News reports: An attorney for the co-founder of opposition research firm Fusion GPS revealed during a closed-door interview this summer with congressional investigators that ?somebody?s already been killed? as a result of the publication of the anti-Trump dossier. The statement was contained in a 312-page transcript of Fusion GPS co-founder GlennSimpson August interview with committee investigators, released unilaterally Tuesday by Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. The release itself provoked controversy, with an aide to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, calling it confoundingfor Feinstein to drop the transcript in the ?middle of an ongoing investigation.? Among the many revelations in the document, though, is the claim fromSimpson attorney that someone died because the dossier ? which was commissioned by Fusion GPS ? was publicly released. ?He wants to be very careful to protect his sources,? attorney Josh Levy said during the Aug. 22 Senate Judiciary Committee interview of his client. ?Somebody?s already been killed as a result of the publication of this dossier and no harm should come to anybody related to this honest work.? Levydidn elaborate on who was killed. The website BuzzFeed first published the dossier online last January, airing its unverified allegations about PresidentTrump connections with Russia. The dossier was written by former British MI6 agent Christopher Steele. Fusion GPS, which hired Steele, got funding from the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee. Trump has long derided the dossier as politically motivated, and several GOP-led committees are investigating whether it formed the basis for theFBI initial investigation into Russian election interference. Feinstein said in a statement she released the transcript to combat misinformation about the interview. ?The innuendo and misinformation circulating about the transcript are part of a deeply troubling effort to undermine the investigation into potential collusion and obstruction of justice,? Feinstein said in a statement. ?The only way to set the record straight is to make the transcript public.? Although the attorneyisn naming any names of who has ?already been killed,? the only person who is suspected of having info on this particular dossier was Seth Rich. Rich was murdered in Washington, D.C. on July 10, 2016, ofwhat being said as a robbery gone deadly. However, a lot of information seems to suggest that cause is nearly impossible. Now, with this latest statement out, the pieces to the puzzle of his suspicious death are starting to come together. This latest assertion that someone has now been killed over the dossier could and should very well be the smoking gunwe been waiting for, which Trump knew was coming. By nowit starting to be very clear that Democratic National CommitteeStaffer death was the cause of some foul play. So clear that we can now add the former candidate and Speaker of the House NewtGingrich name to the list of those calling for an official investigation into the so-called ?Botched Robbery? which ended in the murder of Rich. Gingrich explained: ?We have this very strange story now of this young man who worked for the Democratic National Committee, who apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53,000 emails and 17,000 attachments,? ?Nobody?s investigating that, and what does that tell you aboutwhat going on? Because it turns out, itwasn the Russians. It was this young guy who, I suspect, was disgusted by the corruption of the Democratic National Committee.He been killed, and apparently, nothing serious has been done to investigate his murder. SoI like to see how Robert S. Mueller III is going to define what his assignment is.?It currently being reported that the real source of the Democrat Party email leaks was never the Russians. It was actually the 27-year-old Democrat staffer Seth Rich, who strongly favored the Socialist Bernie Sanders over Crooked Hillary Clinton in the Democrat Primaries. When he learned of the shenanigans and rigging that was taking place against Senator Sanders he managed to get proof of what the DNC was up to. He then went on to report his findings anonymously to the website ?Wikileaks.? Jullian Assange has practically confirmed this whole narrative.What even stranger is how the Rich family was calling for an investigation after the official investigation turned up the narrative that it was just a robbery gone wrong. A robbery were no belongings were taken. Not his expensive watch, wallet or even the phone he was using to talk to his girlfriend at the moment of the robbery. Interestingly enough they have now changed their tunes and what no investigation nor mention of the mystery behindSeth death.

" Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""There are two prongs to her approach,"" Robby Mook, Hillary for America campaign manager told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""The first is to have a set of national standards around how to manage the situations that doesn't exist right now and that could help through training to prevent situations like this."" ""There are no set of national best practices on how to manage situations,"" he continued. ""These situations are handled by local policies currently. And what she is proposing is that we actually set up national standards so that localities have better policies to work with and train towards."" Clinton spoke out Tuesday against ""systematic racism"" following the recent shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Crutcher was shot and killed last week after his car broke down. The 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot him. Crutcher was unarmed at the time. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Wednesday that ""approximately 12 officers"" were injured during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott Tuesday by a police officer. Mook said the other part of Clinton's plans involves working to improve the relationship between police and minorities. ""The second piece is to restore bonds between communities and law enforcement, so investing in community policing and making sure that local police have the resources to build the resources in the community to prevent something like this from happening,"" he said. Clinton told radio host Steve Harvey on Tuesday's ""The Steve Harvey Morning Show"" that she plans to speak ""directly to white people"" about implicit bias. Mook said Wednesday Clinton meant she would explain that different ethnic groups are often treated differently in America. ""What she's saying is our entire country needs to do some real soul-searching here. It is clear that the criminal justice system is not treating everybody the same way,"" he said. ""If you are African-American or from a minority group, you may not be being treated the same as a white person. And that's a problem."" Clinton said Tuesday that while there are ""good, honorable, cool-headed police officers"" working across the country, ""we can do better."" ""We have got to tackle systemic racism,"" Clinton said. ""This horrible shooting again. How many times do we have to see this in our country?"" ""This is just unbearable,"" Clinton said. ""And it needs to be intolerable."" Clinton later tweeted on the shooting, writing, ""Another unarmed Black man was shot in a police incident. This should be intolerable. We have so much work to do. #TerenceCrutcher -H.""

"Donald Trump is, well, deplorable.He suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned rapistsand ?drug dealers? from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a ?temporary measure.?He even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad: ?The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives,don kid yourself. When they say theydon care about their lives, you have to take out their families.? Buthe not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, TheDonald Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism ?he fighting the narrativesof Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. AndTrump narrativeis ?kill them all?: Lastweekend attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on PresidentObama watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believeswe in more than a fight about narratives? these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens. Pay attention to that last bit: ?They must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.? Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is ?radical Islamic terrorism,? and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating ?terrorists?? ?They?re protecting each other, butthey really doing very bad damage ? they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,? Trump said in March. ?When they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, andthat a big problem.? If Muslims are protectingterrorists, are they not terrorists inTrump eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists? families. How would he define terrorism? These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself ? but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents? security to ?see what happens? to them (shortly after suggesting that ?Second Amendment People? could deal with them.We dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the ?little red button? that launches our nuclear arsenal.It also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen ? one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood.

"White, Working-Class and Worried is a CNN partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation - an extensive survey of white, working-class Americans and voters, who form a backbone of the support for Donald Trump. Watch Anderson Cooper 360 and CNN.com for reports throughout the week. Washington (CNN) The white, working-class Americans who form a backbone of Donald Trump's political support have a split view of Muslim immigrants -- strong majorities believe both that immigrants from Muslim countries increase the threat of terrorism in the United States, but also that most immigrants from those countries are good people. The data is from a new survey from CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation and is aimed at unveiling the political motivations of the voting bloc that has propelled the GOP nominee. Threats of terror, both abroad and at home, have repeatedly rolled the race for the White House and the candidates have sought to improve their standing with voters in their responses to the terror attacks in Paris, Brussels, San Bernardino, Calif., and most recently after the attacks in New York and New Jersey. Polls generally show that voters trust Trump more than Hillary Clinton to handle terrorism. Trump's tough talk about combating terrorism and threats abroad, including a plan to erect a wall at the US-Mexico border and his repeated suggestion that profiling as a preventative tactic against terrorism has helped fueled his rise. While a majority (63%) of white, working-class Americans say immigrants from Muslim countries are generally good people, the same share say that immigrants from Muslim countries increase the risk of terrorist attacks. Members of this group, which exit polls had at around 44% of the US electorate in 2012 though the exact figure is difficult to quantify, also have a more negative view of immigration: nearly half (47%) of whites without a college degree view immigrants as a burden on the country. Even among those white, working-class voters who view immigrants as a burden, 50% say immigrants from Muslim countries are good people compared with 35% who say they are not. There is also a partisan divide: White, working-class Democrats are more likely to hold positive views about immigrants from Muslim countries than their white, working-class Republican counterparts. 47% of white Democrats without college degrees say Muslim immigrants increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the US compared with 83% of white Republicans with no college degree. Trump has made his hard line against Muslims a key component of his campaign, and his white, working-class supporters have strong views about the impact of immigrants from Muslim countries. Fifty-three percent of white voters without college degrees who are considering supporting Trump say immigrants from Muslim countries are basically good, but 82% say they increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the US. 'Under attack' More than 6-in-10 white, working-class Americans also say that Christian values are under attack in the United States. That viewpoint is more widespread among older working-class whites than among younger ones. Seventy-three % of white, working class adults 65 and older said Christian values are under attack, while just 41% of working-class adults under the age of 30 said the same. Trump backers were more likely to say that Christian values were under attack than those who support Clinton. Eighty-one percent of white, working-class voters who would consider supporting him in November said Christian values were under attack, compared to 31% who support Clinton. Candidate positioning In the hours following the bombings in New York and New Jersey, Clinton and Trump tussled over who was better qualified to combat terrorism as well as its cause. Clinton cast herself as the candidate best prepared to combat terrorism and said that her opponent's positions are ""not grounded in fact"" and ""meant to make some kind of demagogic point."" ""I am prepared to, ready to actually take on those challenges,"" the former secretary of state told reporters on Monday, ""not engage in a lot of irresponsible, reckless rhetoric."" Trump blamed Clinton and President Barack Obama for failing to keep the country safe and called for profiling to beef up what he sees as currently lackluster anti-terrorism efforts. Instead of treading lightly, Trump said on Fox News Monday morning, the better approach would be to ""knock the hell out of 'em."" ""Our local police, they know who a lot of these people are,"" Trump told Fox. ""They are afraid to do anything about it, because they don't want to be accused of profiling. And they don't want to be accused of all sorts of things.""",0.039179104,0.003731343,0.005597015,0.007462687,0.065298507,0.358208955,0.048507463,2,-1,1

Late Tuesday, defense attorneys wrote to federal magistrate judge Gabriel Gorenstein asking that Rahami be promptly informed of the charges against him at a court proceeding that would also formally advise him of his right to counsel and his right to remain silent. However, prosecutors from the office of U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara said in a letter to the magistrate Wednesday that Rahami isn't in federal custody so there is no legal obligation for the federal courts to get involved. ""The defendant in this case, Ahmad Khan Rahami, a/k/a 'Ahmad Rahimi,' has not been arrested on any federal charge. He is not in federal custody. He is in the custody of the State of New Jersey, on state charges, and is subject to a bail package issued by the New Jersey state court,"" federal prosecutors wrote. ""While a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum has been lodged with the United States Marshals Service, it has not been executed, and there has been no such federal arrest."" The writ referred to in the federal prosecutors' letter would require state or local officials to hand over Rahami to federal authorities for prosecution. Rahami is facing five attempted murder charges in a New Jersey court in connection with a shootout Monday morning in which the suspect and two police officers were wounded. Rahami is currently in a Newark hospital. A judge has set $5.2 million bail and an initial county court appearance for Sept. 28. Defense lawyers contend that Rahami has been ""without the benefit of counsel"" since his arrest, but it's unclear whether he's been advised of his Miranda rights or whether he's made some decision not to meet with an attorney. Lawmakers briefed on the investigation say he has not been cooperating. While Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday that Rahami would be taken to Manhattan in the ""near future,"" the letter from prosecutors evinces no urgency to such a move. Prosecutors say Rahami has no rights in the federal system at the moment, including a right to counsel. The letter indicates that lawyers from the Federal Defenders office in New York have sought appointment in Rahami's case, but prosecutors say that's ""plainly premature"" until he is brought to court.

"Hillary Clinton said it was important to ""restore the bonds of trust between police officers and the communities they serve."" | Getty Clinton stresses 'bonds of trust' in calls with Charlotte officials Hillary Clinton offered her assistance to Charlotte officials Thursday following two days of protests and violence in the city, urging the community to ""come together to stop the violence."" According to a pool report readout of phone conversations between Clinton, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts and North Carolina Rep. Alma Adams, the Democratic nominee emphasized the importance of restoring ""the bonds of trust between police officers and the communities they serve."" Story Continued Below During the call, Clinton stressed that ""too many Black Americans have lost their lives and too many feel that their lives are disposable."" The former secretary of state made similar comments two days prior when she lamented the horribleshooting death of an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last Friday, adding that it is ?just unbearable and needs to be intolerable."" The Democratic nominee also called for unity in a time of turbulence. ""They discussed the steps we must take to ensure that everyone is respected by the law, and everyone has respect for the law,"" according to the readout. ""There are good, honorable police officers serving their communities across our country, and we must all work together to mend the wounds that exist and build the America we want our children and grandchildren to grow up in,"" the readout adds. Mayor Roberts later praised Clinton's initiative in reaching out to local officials during an interview on CNN, quipping that the former secretary of state had visited the city so often during the campaign that ""it could almost be a second home to her."" ""She did lend her support to the city,"" Roberts said. ""She understands that big cities has challenges and she wanted me to know that if there's anything she could do to help, that she would be happy to do that."" Roberts said she was not aware plans by either Clinton or Trump's campaign to visit Charlotte in the coming days. Charlotte has seen two days of protests and violence following the shooting death of Keith Lamont Scott, an African-American man who was pulled over by police officer Brentley Vinson Tuesday. Twelve officers were injured on the first night of protests Tuesday, while another disputed shooting Wednesday night left a protester in critical condition. That protester died Thursday. Forty four arrests have been made. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrocry called for a state of emergency in Charlotte late Wednesday as clashes between police officers and protesters escalated. ""These police officers are showing a tremendous amount of courage and there's obviously a few hundred people who have come to our town center in Charlotte, North Carolina, which is a great city in and their major goal seems to be destruction and harm and that's wrong and it's unacceptable,"" McCrory said on CNN shortly after making the announcement. ""We cannot tolerate violence or tolerate the destruction of property and will not tolerate the attacks towards our police officers occurring right now and I feel very strongly about that right now,"" he added. ""That is not the American way.""",0.027027027000000002,0.005405405,0.0,0.018918919,0.07027027,0.291891892,0.0,2,-1,1
"Rye Brook, New York  Hillary Clinton might be viewed as the favorite going into Monday's presidential debate. But she certainly didn't prepare like one. Clinton, a candidate known for being a homebody, was for most of the three nights leading up to Monday's debate working at a hotel a few miles from her Chappaqua, New York home, hunkered down with aides in a nondescript conference center surrounded by wedding parties and high school reunion goers. Clinton spent Friday, Saturday and Sunday night at the Doral Arrowwood, returning home past 11 p.m. every night after sessions with a tight group of aides and advisers. The late night sessions appeared to mimic the timing of Monday's debate at Hofstra University, which will run 90 minutes and start at 9 p.m. Clinton's prep was not limited to late at night, however. On Saturday and Sunday, Clinton visited the hotel twice a day: Once at night and again for a few hours in the afternoon. The frequency and timing of the sessions -- hours before Clinton meets Donald Trump -- are an acknowledgment that the former secretary of state took her debate preparations seriously, investing four days of would-be campaigning to find a way to do what no Republican candidate could: Defeat Trump. The sessions also mimic Clinton, a candidate who aides refer to as a worrier. ""Like a lot of women, I have a tendency to over prepare,"" Clinton said at Greensboro, North Carolina event earlier this month. ""I sweat the details."" Trump, on the other hand, has said that he doesn't want to over-prepare for Monday's debate. While he met with top advisers on Sunday to hash out debate strategy, the Republican nominee has largely eschewed with traditional debate prep, deciding instead to trust his instincts on Monday night. Jason Miller, Trump's spokesman, mocked Clinton's two-a-day preparation on Monday morning. ""That might be something to brag about when you are getting ready to high school football but I am not sure heading into arguably the biggest presidential debate that our country has ever seen that that is something that you want to be putting out there,"" Miller said. The Doral Arrowwood, a 337-room hotel better known locally as an event space and golf course, is an odd scene for such preparations: As Clinton worked with aides, the hotel was busy hosting a high school reunion, a wedding and a meeting of pharmaceutical employees. Clinton entered and exited the hotel through a back entrance and her van positioned so that she did not have to walk through the lobby to get to the conference center hosting her prep. Hotel guests were however aware of Clinton's presence and her secret service protected van was parked near the main entrance of the hotel. Aides worry that expectations for Clinton's performance might be impossibly high, given the fact that Monday's contest will be over her 40 televised debate, including contests during her 2008 presidential run and her Senate run in 2000. Blatantly playing the expectations game, aides have publicly looked to muddy the view that Clinton should dominate on Monday by touting Trump's reality show personality and showman qualities. Their argument: Debates are about theater more than substance, and on that measure Trump has more experience. ""For all his lack of substance, Trump's showmanship, as ex-reality TV star, makes him a formidable debate foe. He thrashed his rivals in GOP debates,"" Brian Fallon, Clinton's national press secretary, tweeted in August. To try to compensate -- and knock Trump off his game -- people advising Clinton have been looking for one-line retorts that could become memorable moments from the contest. The all-day sessions are being led by Ron Klain , who advised President Barack Obama, and Karen Dunn, a longtime lawyer and aide. Clinton was joined in the sessions by Huma Abedin, her longtime aide; John Podesta, her campaign chairman; and Jake Sullivan, Clinton's top policy aide, according to the sources. Philippe Reines, a longtime adviser known for his combative style and fierce loyalty to Clinton, is playing Trump in debate prep Reines has spent more time playing ""Presidential Trump"" than ""bombastic Trump,"" according to a source with knowledge of the prep. Reines, in an effort to prepare Clinton for a more polished Trump, has even ad lib an opening statement heralding the milestone of Clinton becoming the first woman nominee of a major presidential party, the source says. What Donald Trump shows up has been a key concern for Clinton's top aides, including that small group of advisers who have been inside her debate prep. According to the source, the aides expect Trump to be a more polished, reserved candidate than the boisterous and off-the-cuff candidate that has been seen across the country on the campaign's trail. The source says Clinton has done some prep with ""bombastic Trump,"" but more have been with a more reserved candidate. Earlier in the process, Clinton spent hours watching a highlight reel of Trump's Republican primary debates, according to several people familiar with her debate preparation. She took notes on what agitated him and studied his positions with the hopes of getting under his skin with her familiarity. Clinton has told friends and supporters that her biggest concern is not knowing which Donald Trump will show up on Monday night: A more moderate, controlled Republican nominee or the more blunt and combative candidate? ""I do not know which Donald Trump will show up,"" Clinton said at an August fundraiser in New York. ""Maybe he will try to be presidential and try to convey a gravity that he hasn't done before or will he come in and try to insult and try to score some points.""",0.020802377,0.013372957,0.004457652,0.008915305,0.035661218,0.252600297,0.0,2,-1,1
"Hill Republicans: At least Trump didn't blow it GOP lawmakers just need him to avoid a monumental blunder that could sink their own candidates on the ballot. Capitol Hill Republicans grumbled Tuesday about DonaldTrump debate performance, but they also saw a silver lining: Hedidn overtly screw up their own election prospects ? at least not yet. Theydidn need a lot from him: justdon let the floor collapse on the Republican Party with an election-altering gaffe. So even after their nominee all but admitted paying no federal taxes and stood by his attacks on a woman for gaining too much weight, plenty of congressional Republicans were breathing a sigh of relief. And no one was predicting doomsday on Nov. 8. Story Continued Below ?He made his points and hedidn make any major mistakes. ? so I think he had a very good night,? said Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma. ?We?re to the point now that our presidential nominee is helping us, not hurting us, and that was an unknown several months ago.He performing above expectations andwe benefiting from it in the House and will probably benefit from it in the Senate as well.?That a remarkable change in tone for the party that fretted for months about a down-ballot backlash against their nominee. Republicans worriedTrump controversial comments would cripple their incumbents and wipe out their Senate and possibly even House majorities. ButTrump improved performance this month has buoyed congressional Republicans, to the point that those fears have morphed into hopes of minimal House losses and keeping the Senate. And while his performance Monday was far from flawless ? he was too easily goaded by Hillary Clinton instead of hammering at her vulnerabilities, several Republicans said ? it could have been a lot worse. ?I thinkit basically a wash,? said Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, who heads the Senate Republican campaign arm. ?I think he did just fine.? House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has been highly critical ofTrump controversial comments in the past, also gave thenominee performance a robust endorsement. ?I saw Donald Trump give a spirited voice to those of us whodon like the status quo, and I see emerging in front of us the potential for what a unified Republican government can get you, which can be the solutions,? the Wisconsin Republican said at a news conference. ?I think he passed a number of thresholds ? and showed that for 90 minutes he could go toe-to-toe with Hillary Clinton.? Other Republicans were less enthused. Republican Study Committee Chairman Bill Flores of Texas said Trump ?made some good points, but hewasn as consistent as he could be.? Another Texan, House Rules Chairman Pete Sessions, saidTrump ?abilities are greater? than he showed. And moderate Rep. Charlie Dent, a frequent Trump critic, said the nominee did not meet his goal of demonstrating that he could be presidential and substantive on the issues. ?I think the reaction from a lot of people is: ?In a nation of over 300 million people, this is the best we can do??? the Pennsylvania Republican said. ?I thought I was watching a dumpster fire.? Rep. Patrick Meehan, also of Pennsylvania, said Trump ?had an idea where he wanted to go,? butdidn quite get there: ?He started out strong but needed to be able to stay disciplined, and I think the next debateyou probably see him more capable of doing that.? Even Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), a Trump supporter,wouldn say Trump won. ?From the lens of Trump supporters, they would believe he did well, and from the lens of a Clinton view, they would say she clearly won,? Zeldin said. ?As for undecided voters, Idon know. ? Each side scored some points. Both sides as they watch the video afterwards may say, ?Maybe I should have answered this question a little differently.?? Some Republicans, including Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas),didn want to talk about the debate at all. Others claimed theydidn watch it and thereforecouldn weigh in. Those who did, however, said one ofTrump weaker moments came when Clinton attacked him for calling a former beauty pageant contestant ?Miss Piggy? when she later gained weight. Trump doubled down on those comments in an interview on Fox News. Asked aboutTrump pageant comments, Zeldin, without calling out Trump specifically, said his best advice ?for anyone running for office is to focus on your policy, your vision.? Ryanwouldn comment on the pageant remarks. Democrats on the Hill, meanwhile, saidTrump performance showed why heshouldn be president. House Minority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland said his answers provedit be dangerousfor him to be ?leader of the free world.? House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra of California dodged a question about whetherTrump behavior ? interrupting and talking over Clinton multiple times ? was sexist, but did say it was clear the GOP nominee became unhingedover the course of the 90-minute faceoff. ?And I thinkthat the last thing we want for a president who will have his or her finger over the nuclear button, someone who becomes unhinged so easily,? Becerra told reporters. ?I think Donald Trump essentially showed who he is.? Overall, though, several Republicansdidn feelTrump missteps were a big deal. ?I think there were some missed opportunities, butlet face it: For all the complaining about the Clinton camp, the bar was set low and all he had to do was prove he had a good temperament,? said Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania. ?I think he met that test, so Idon now what all the complaining is about. ?I not worried.? Republicans also noted that Trump showed again thathe his own breed. During the debate, he railed against trade and backed Democrats? pitch to revoke gun rights from people on the ?no-fly? list, for example. This, some felt, created a buffer to separate the party from the wild, and at times unruly, candidate.

"Posted by Jenna LeFever on 21 Sep 2016 Police protected and served the hell out of a teen girl in Hagerstown, Md. in a chilling incident that took place on Sunday. The 15-year-old biracial girl was riding her bike when she was hit by a car. She laid unconscious on the pavement for about 30 seconds and when she came to, she checked herself for injuries and decided to ride her bike home. Witnesses urged her to wait for the ambulance and police to show up, but the girl said she was fine and wanted to leave the scene.That when the police showed up and the situation went from bad to worse. In a Facebook video posted online, an onlooker caught the police manhandling the girl, slamming her into a wall, handcuffing her, shoving her into the back of a police car then pepper-spraying her in the face. For being hit by a car and trying to leave the girl was slapped with disorderly conduct, two counts of second-degree assault, possession of marijuana and failure to obey a traffic device. An attorney for the girl named Robin Ficker recounted the incident: She was dazed, then she got up and realized she was OK.? Ficker says when paramedics arrived the girl refused medical assistance and when she tried to ride away on her bike, police pulled the 5 foot 105 lbs girl off her bike. At this point, Ficker says the police lifted both her arms above her head and slammed her face first into a wall, adding: Her face hit the windowsill.? Ficker said at this point his client became terrified and struggled with police as they shoved her into the back of a police car. She refused to pull her feet into the car.That when the video begins. The cop warns her to pull her feet in orshe get pepper sprayed. In the video, the girl begs the white officers to call Zackwho was a black officer she was apparently familiar with. A bystander then intervenes and questions the police over why they are treating the girl so roughly, the officer responds: ?Whathappensshe like, ?I?m fine,? right, and has a brain injury or something like that, and then she could die later? Andshe going to come over here and fight us when all we want to do is make sureshe OK.? At this point, the police close the door on thegirl feet and through a cracked window gas the backseat with pepper spray while the girl screams that shecan breathe. Despite thepolice insistence, the girl had to be evaluated by a hospital for her injuries, rather than take her to the ER or turn her over to the paramedics, they take her straight to the police station and booked her on multiple charges. It took three hours for the girl to be released from jail, where her father drove her straight to the hospital to get the burning chemicals flushed from her eyes. Ficker says: The only treatment she got (from police) was slamming, abuse and Mace.? The girl is an honor student and never had a run-in with the law until Sunday. The Hagerstown police say they are reviewing body cam footage of the incident, but found the girl to be at fault for the bicycle accident.

" During a Fox and Friends interview Monday morning to talk about the NYC bombings, Donald Trump came dangerously close to suggesting unheard of levels of censorship. Trump asserted that the the biggest obstacle towards stopping terrorism at home is the first amendment and the lax attitude surrounding freedom of the press. Referring to jihadi propaganda, the Donald said: ?They?re all talking about it so wonderfully because, you know,it called ?freedom of the press,? where you buy magazines and they tell you how to make these same bombs that I saw. They tell you how to make bombs. We should arrest the people that do that becausethey participating in crime. Instead they say ?oh no youcan do anything,that freedom of expression.? Of course, this is wild conjecture. There is no way Donald Trump has absolutely any idea why the New York bomber decided to build these bombs, the information for which is easily found in a cursory Google search, which has nothing to do with how that possibly relates to the print newsmedia freedom of expression, whichhe criticized on numerous occasions. The type of publications that would even contain this kind of information ?we assuminghe referring to the Daeshi magazine, Dabiq ? are diligently hunted down and taken off the website by counterterror forces. But the most terrifying aspect of this line of thinking, is how casually it could use the ?boogeyman of terrorism? to make freedom of speech disposable, setting a dangerous precedent that could be expanded to censor any kind of dissenting opinion. Trump, has long demonstrated his disdain for the press, and has a chilling history that suggests he would be open to embracing unconstitutional censorship. Trump has praised the leadership of Russia, admiring its strengthdespite its history of censorship and human rights abuses including state control of the media and regular murder of dissident journalists. Back in August, he took to Twitter and railed against ?the corrupt media? and freedom of the press for having the audacity to look into his personal life and to dig up the skeletons in his closet. Although Trump has never actually revealed what he would do to address this grievance with the press, his comments underscore a grim future ahead for America if he is elected. Trump has taken every opportunity to criticize and attempt to discredit anyone that disagrees with him in any way, leaving behind a trail of journalists and citizens fed up with appalling lack of regard to the First Amendment and the founding principles of our nation.Here the full interview with Fox & Friends: Download our NEW Occupy Democrats app for your iPhone by clicking here or for your Android by clicking here.

"Donald Trump on Tuesday morning floated the idea that he ?may hit her harder? next time around against Hillary Clinton. | Getty Trump points fingers after shaky debate But after a day of feuding, Trump came back to a familiar script Tuesday night in front of a friendly crowd. After a long night on Long Island on Monday, Donald Trump showed no signs of wavering at an evening rally inside an airport hangar in Melbourne, Florida in front of a friendly crowd. A day removed from the debate stage, Trump stuck close to his stump speech, repeating familiar refrains about himself, about Hillary Clinton, about his vision for his presidency and about the country he sees in front of him. The lone wrinkle to his stump speech was a new wave of claims about howhe won the debate. Pointing to his wins in numerous, un-scientific online reader polls on websites like the Drudge Report, Trump was no more deterred by a broad sentiment among political observers thathe lost than he was by an army of fact-checkerswho found many of his favorite claims are false. Story Continued Below Indeed, back in the familiar confines of a rally, Trump appeared more comfortable than the night before, leveling strong attacks against Clinton that, after repeating throughout the election, he often stayed away from Monday. Trump also cast the debate as a contrast between change and the status quo. ?For 90 minutes on issue after issue Hillary Clinton defended the terrible status quo while I laid out our plan, all of us together, to bring jobs prosperity and security back to the American people,? he said. ?For 90 minutes she argued against change while I called for dramatic change.? He also revealed how he dealt with his nerves in front of a television audience of 80 million people. ?I knew I was going into a situation where you were going to have one of the largest audiences in the history of television. And I took a deep breath and I pretended I was talking to my family,? Trump said. ?It was very interesting. You just block it out.? ?Does everybody believe me? I was against going into Iraq,? said Trump, after the timeline of his opinions came under scrutiny once again on Monday night. (Before the invasion Trump expressed approval of it in a Howard Stern interview, and is only documented as firmly opposing it in an interview well after the American occupation of the country began.) Of the current state of the country, Trump lamented, ?We have death and debt and unemployment. We have all bad things.? He called Clinton ?a representative for globalists? and mocked lastmonth consensus that he had only the narrowest electoral path to the presidency, remarking, ?Oh wow, nowthey looking at all these paths.? Trump did steer clear of another post-debate controversy, an ongoing war of words with former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who was the centerpiece of one ofClinton attacks on his character. Trump earlier Tuesday again criticized Machado's weight, echoing Clinton allegations thathe earlier called her ?Miss Piggy? ? due to her body shape ? and ?Miss Housekeeping,? a racist reference to her Latino heritage. But on Tuesday evening, back in front of a large, boisterous, adoring crowd, Trump avoided the subject entirely. The rally followed a tumultuous 24 hours for Trump, starting with a panned debate performance Monday that morphed into a day of finger-pointing Tuesday, as he revived his brashest personal style to explain an erratic debate performance. The GOP nominee, beleaguered after an erratic performance inMonday debate ? with viewership as high as 100 million ? retreated to his Fox News and Twitter cocoon. There, he took potshots at debate moderator Lester Holt and cited unscientific Internet surveys to provehe outperformed Hillary Clinton. And his advisers hinted that he might consider skipping the next showdown between the candidates, set for Oct. 9 in St. Louis. It was a scarcely concealed defensive posture from the Trump camp, which found itself defending Trump against accusations of sexism (even as he redoubled his criticism of a former Miss Universe he had previously called ?Miss Piggy,? saying on Tuesday she had gained ?a massive amount of weight?). His surrogates, too, joined the pile-on against Holt, describing hostilequestioning about his position on the Iraq War, his role in the birther controversy and his refusal to release his tax returns. Trump spent his post-debate morning in the friendly confines of Fox, calling in to ?Fox & Friends? for a gentle interview, where the hosts agreed he had been asked too many tough questions. Trump couched his concerns about Holt around mild praise of his performance as moderator, but his allies correctly pointed out that Holt reserved his most probing and personal questions for the businessman and spared Clinton similarly tough questions about her handling of classified information or her untrustworthy persona. ?You know, when you look at it, you watch the last four questions, he hit me on birther,? Trump said, ?He hit me on a housing deal from many years ago that I settled with no recourse and no guilt. He asked me about that.? But actually, it was Clinton who raised the 1973 housing discrimination lawsuit againstTrump company. She also grilled him about paying no income tax over the years.Trump ?That makes me smart? reply has Democrats salivating. (Clinton at a rally on Tuesday afternoon asked the crowd, ?if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make all the rest of us??) Trump on Tuesday morning floated the idea that he ?may hit her harder? next time around, and explained, ?I really eased up because I didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings.? It was remarkable how many subjects Trump decided to skip inMonday debate. He made no mention ofClinton handling of the attack on an American compound in Benghazi. He scarcely alluded to his aggressive seal-the-borders stance on immigration, despite making it the hallmark of his campaign. Trumpdidn mention controversies about Clinton Foundation or her ties to Wall Street. (Clinton actually got in the only Wall Street-based attack, suggesting Trump was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt to big banks.) Trump also skipped any mention ofClinton decision to label some of his supporters ?deplorable.? And even as she skewered him for misleading about his position on the war in Iraq, he made only a passing mention of the fact that Clinton voted to go to war in the first place. ?Well, he didn't ask her about the emails at all. He didn't ask her about her scandals. He didn't ask her about the Benghazi deal that she destroyed,? he said about Holt. ?He didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. I mean, you know, there's no question about it. He didn't ask about her foundation.? Holtwasn the only target ofTrump ire. He also peddled a conspiracy theory that his microphone had been tampered with, as he sought to explain why he may not have been at the top of his game, even as he claimed numerous online polls deemed him thenight winner. ?Idon know if you saw that in the room, but my microphone was terrible. I wonder, was it set up that way on purpose?? Trump asked on Fox. Clinton reveled inTrump squirming. Buoyant from the prior night, the former secretary of state gaggled with reporters on her plane, offering a verbal shrug to the notion that Trump may not show up to the next two debates, and landing a zinger aboutTrump microphone theory. ?Anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night,? Clinton quipped as she walked away from reporters.Trump surrogates sought to frame the debate as a win for the Republican nominee, largely because hedidn bring up BillClinton extramarital affairs, even though Trump alluded to them later in the evening. Kellyanne Conway,Trump campaign manager, said on Tuesday morning that ?as a woman? she was impressed that Trump pulled back from bringing up the affairs after Clinton attacked him for a long history of misogynistic comments. ?To tell Hillary Clinton after she accused him of being terrible with women, to tell Hillary Clinton 'I was prepared to go rough tonight and I am not going to do it because your husband and daughter are here.' That is going to grow in importance in the next couple of days in a moment of great temperance and restraint,? Conway toldMSNBC ?Morning Joe.?Trump running mate, Mike Pence, parroted the talking points onCBS ?This Morning,? also saying he was ?so proud? that Trumpdidn bring up BillClinton indiscretions. ?Ninety minutes in a row of one insult after another and then Donald Trump, just completely open and transparent with the American people, said, ?There?s things I could bring up, we all know what they are, we all lived through the1990,? and he just said ?I?m not going to do it.'? Pence said. ?I think there you saw in him the restraint and temperament that would make for a good president.? WhileTrump allies argued that Trump had cleared an arguably low bar during his first primetime showdown, House Speaker Paul Ryan offered unusually effusive praise for the Republican nominee. Ryan has frequently clashed with Trump on style and substance, but he said the billionaire did what he needed to do on Monday night. For Republican lawmakers concerned aboutTrump effect on down-ballot races, the fact that Trump did not implode on stage was a relief. ?I saw Donald Trump give a spirited voice to those of us whodon like the status quo, and I see emerging in front of us the potential for what a unified Republican government can get you, which can be the solutions,? Ryan said at a news conference Tuesday. ?I think he passed a number of thresholds... and showed that for 90 minutes he could go toe-to-toe with Hillary Clinton.? Most pundits agreedTrump strongest part of the debate was the first 20 to 30 minutes, when he parriedClinton barbs and painted her as a typical politician ? the kind he certainly is not. In a discussion of thecountry international trade deals, Trump thrashed Clinton as taking a politically motivated tack. ?In all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently,? he said. ?She's been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn't she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective ? Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.? Trump saidhe tax companies who send jobs and plants to other countries and sell their products back to the United States. ?What you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck,? he said. ?But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.?Trump camp is already hintinghe considering taking a pass on the next debate. Trump surrogate Rudy Giuliani told reporters Monday night thathe advise Trump to drop out of the next meeting because the moderatorswouldn be fair. ?If I were Donald Trump Iwouldn participate in another debate unless I was promised that the journalist would act like a journalist and not an incorrect, ignorant fact checker,? Giuliani said. ?The moderator would have to promise that there would be a moderator and not a fact checker and in two particular cases an enormously ignorant, completely misinformed fact checker.? Clinton and her allies, on the other hand, are blanketing the airwaves. Priorities USA immediately launched an ad blastingTrump temperament. The Clinton campaign issued its own blistering video: an interview with Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe winner who said Trump demeaned her when she gained weight. Campaign strategist Joel Benenson told CNN on Tuesday that Clinton was calm and collected under pressure while Trump became unhinged. ?The reason why Hillary Clinton overwhelmingly won in this debate is because Donald Trump was a loose cannon throughout the debate,? Benenson said. ?He was interrupting. He doesn't listen to anybody. He doesn't respect anybody. He was shouting.? In addition, Clinton, her running mate Tim Kaine and her husband, former President Bill Clinton hit the trail for her, hoping to capture some momentum from the debate. CNN's post-debate polling showed viewers largely found Clinton superior to Trump, thoughit unclear whether the debate will lead to movement in the swing-state polls, which have shown the two candidates in a dead heat.

"Sheriff Clarke Knows What the Instigators of Charlotte RIOTS Are Up To ? Sends Message to Police Everywhere Rioters have taken over Charlotte, North Carolina. The situation has become so bad that Governor Pat McCrory has declared a state of emergency and called in the National Guard. One personisn having it though andthat Sheriff David Clarke. Nicknamed ?America?s Sheriff,? Clarke is known for his commonsense approach to controversial issues and his politically incorrect devotion to telling it like it is. Sheriff Clarke was on StuartVarney show on the Fox Business Network and weighed in on the riots in Charlotte, and he hit the nail right on the head. Clarke completely rejected the idea that the rioters were actually protesters trying to combat racial injustice. ?This has become a political construct and I said that four months in December of 2014 after Ferguson,? Clarke said. ?I know these people, I know whatthey up to, I know their mode. These are anarchists! The anarchists are exploiting these poor people in these urban ghettos to be the riot starters so until the police commanders start to understand what this movement is ? all they have to do is go back to the war on cops in the60.? He also called on police to stop handling these rioters with kid gloves. According to Clarke, police must act more aggressively to stop the violent activists before it gets out of control. And the situation in Charlotte is truly out of control. In addition to blocking highways and looting businesses, the rioters have turned violent. They were smashing windows and setting fire to businesses. At least one person has been killed and multiple police officers have been injured. They even began attacking the media, which has largely been sympathetic to their cause. A CNN reporter was body-slammed live on air and the rioters tried to kill a photographer by throwing him into a fire. But the violencedidn end there. After a black man shot another protester, demonstrators began throwing bottles, dirt clods and fireworks at the officers. The police fired flash grenades and then tear gas back, dispersing the crowd of several hundred. Protesters responded by hurling trash cans and potted plants. This is not about protesting the death of an allegedly innocent person.

"Michelle Obama NOT Leaving The White House ? Hillary Clinton Has Terrifying New Role For Her!?!? The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill. I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election. What exactly is First Lady MichelleObama legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous ?for the first time in my lifeI proud of my country.? I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her ?#BringBackOurGirls? sign. But why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration? *insert mechanical applause here* But what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do?It not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children.

Back in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. ?I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,? she said. ?I have a rest-of-my-life horizon.? This reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the ?Idon like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas? vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something. Either way,I absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children.

"Story highlights Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine says third-party Libertarian candidates will lose He acknowledged that he and Clinton will make a case to voters who may be considering Johnson (CNN) Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine has a message for voters considering a third-party candidate: They're going to lose. ""The argument against the ticket is, I think, everybody knows that they're not going to win,"" Kaine said of the Gary Johnson and Bill Weld Libertarian ticket in an interview with Yahoo News' Katie Couric this week. Hillary Clinton's running mate pointed to the 2000 election as evidence that a protest vote for a third-party candidate can affect the outcome of the race -- and history. ""My argument against the (Johnson-Weld) ticket is the Al Gore-George W. Bush race in 2000. The third party candidacy of Ralph Nader cost Gore electoral votes in New Hampshire and Florida. And if Gore had been president, we probably wouldn't had a war in Iraq,"" he said. ""Casting a vote, a protest vote, for a third-party candidate that's going to lose may well affect the outcome.

"To say that the relationship between Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan is a bit tepid would be nothing short of an understatement. Nevertheless, for all of their differences that have been repeatedly highlighted by the liberal media, Ryan has endorsed Trump over Democrat rival Hillary Clinton, and thatdidn change following Mondaynight presidential debate. According to Politico, Ryan broke from some other seemingly disappointed Republicans on Capitol Hill to offer high praise forTrump debate performance. ?I saw Donald Trump give a spirited voice to those of us whodon like the status quo, and I see emerging in front of us the potential for what a unified Republican government can get you, which can be the solutions,? Ryan stated Tuesday morning at a press conference. ?I think he passed a number of thresholds ? and showed that for 90 minutes he could go toe-to-toe with Hillary Clinton,? he added.

Nevertheless, Trump was not hung out to dry by his fellow Republicans after the debate, and the high praise from Ryan showed that at least some in the GOP establishment have apparently come to terms with Trump as potentially the next president.

"Hey, Chucklehead, there are millions of Veterans who would happily debate you on the issues, because our bond is in our commitment to this Nation. As Written By Allen B. West: Well, I love it when the liberal progressive socialist left shows us who they really are. And just exactly whothey become was on full display at the most recent Democrat convention in Philadelphia ? by the way, kinda weird for advocates of the ?fundamental transformation of America? to hold their convention in the place where this Republic was fundamentally established. Anyhow, we saw the new American socialist party boo a decorated US Marine Corps General. We saw the party of the jackass interrupt a moment of silence for our law enforcement officers ? shouting ?black lives matter.? We witnessed the deplorable actions of the audience harassing and shouting down a Medal of Honor recipient. We already know the sitting president, and the person nominated to be president by the real party of deplorables, abandoned Americans to die in a combat engagement and then advanced a false narrative, a lie. And, shamefully, the liberal progressives, led by Barack Obama, have done nothing to resolve the issues plaguing our Veterans Administration ? to the detriment, and death, of those who were willing to make the last full measure of devotion to this great Nation. So, the most recent display of Democrat disdain towards our military should come as no surprise. As reported by the Washington Free Beacon, Randy Perkins, a Democrat running for Congress inFlorida 18th district, berated his Republican opponent, Brian Mast, on Monday for claiming that his military service qualifies him to serve in Congress. ?So tell me why the sacrifices and the services that you have provided for this country make you capable of solving issues?? Perkins asked Mast, a double-amputee veteran of the war in Afghanistan, at a recent candidate forum. Perkins then listed off numerous issues and asked Mast how he would fix them. ?Well,itwhat involved in that service that makes me very capable of solving any number of those issues,? Mast responded. Before Mast could explain how he would address various issues, Perkins interjected and told him to pick two specifically. Mast named the ongoing problems with the Department of Veteran Affairs and recent changes to the rules of engagement for combat as issues for which he could offer solutions if elected to Congress. Perkins again interrupted Mast before he could offer his solutions. Perkins became incensed that Mast offered up issues relating to the military and continued to talk over the Republican. Just so you know, Brian Mast was a Special Operations EOD Specialist, so ifthere anyone who knows how to solve issues, it would be Brian Mast. But sadly, we see that for the leftists, military service trulydoesn mean anything. I suppose Mr. Perkins, if he could, would look General George Washington in the eye and ask him, ?yo dude, what makes you think your service in the military qualifies you to be president?? I think Mr. Perkins should know that it was not too long ago, about 45 years, that between 73%-76% of the folks on Capitol Hill had served in the military ? but hey, you know, we are just so dumbwe not capable of solving problems. What truly dismissive and disrespectful behavior exhibited from this misguided soul.I seen young enlisted men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, under the most extreme and dangerous situations, making key decisions where lives were at stake. Based on my time on Capitol Hill, I can attest that the difference between those who served in the military and politicians is that wedon head home until the mission is accomplished. Mr. Perkins represents the progressive socialist left attitude that only a certain elite should be allowed into the realm of serving the public ? actually, to their minds, being served by the public. Anyonewho been willing to give their life for this great Nation has exhibited the highest form of leadership, and that, frankly, over-qualifies them to hold political office. Can you imagine Perkins looking at Grant, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Carter and Bush Sr. as they first ran for political office and challenging them on continuing their service to this Nation, but as an elected official? Think about this scenario: what happened when former Congressman Joe Walsh made what the left deemed a similar statement about former US Army helicopter pilot, and double amputee, now Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth? The left went apoplectic and abjectly nuts attacking Walsh; will the left make the same assertions and condemnations about Perkins? Yes,that a rhetorical question because they will not. See, there are different rules for the left. When it comes to their double amputee combat Veteran, of course their sacrifice makes them qualified to run for political office. However, ifyou not part of the socialist-led tribe, then your sacrifices and loss of your legs mean nothing. Just like you can be an unaccomplished community organizer, but ifyou a progressive socialist having the right skin color, why of courseyou qualified to be president. But, ifyou a constitutional conservative and black,you denigrated and disparaged as an Uncle Tom, sellout, oreo, House N!@#er or whiteman porch monkey. Randy Perkins is a disgusting and deplorable individual, but he is reflective of his party. They define who is acceptable, capable and qualified ? and ifyou not embracing their ideology, well, you can watch the video and judge for yourself. Sadly, there are those in South Florida who will support this disturbed person who just disrespected all American Veterans, disabled or otherwise ? telling them that their service in the military means nothing.

"Clinton hits Trump over '$14 million' from father Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton clashed over how much help Trump received with his business dealings, moments after the first presidential debate of the general election began. ?You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit,? Clinton said, soon after the debate kicked off at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. ?He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.

"Navy Sailor PROUDLY Sits During National Anthem In Uniform ? Navy Veterans Set Her STRAIGHT! [VIDEO] Yet another black female sailor declared that she would sit during the National Anthem. Janaye Ervin posted on Facebook her intentions and declared the Navy was punishing her for exercising her constitutional rights. The military is a realm unto its own. It is governed by military law and procedure. This woman has served in the Navy for eight years? she damn well knows that and is using a Marxist/terrorist tactic?she using our own freedoms against us. Ervin is in violation of Navy regulations. They require all uniformed personnel to stand at attention and face the ensign while the anthem is played. You do not get an exception because you are black. As John Bloomer pointed out, anyone has a right to protest, but action conducted as a protest does not grant immunity from the law or a pass on any social consequence. The discipline within the naval ranks is warranted on her actions or lack thereof. From the Independent Review Journal: The national anthem protests ? inspired by 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick ? were just gathering steam when the first American military member raised eyebrows by joining in. Facebook community, US Army Military Police WTF Moments, posted video of the sailor, who said that she would not stand for the anthem ?until the U.S. proves thatthey got my back as a black woman?: Although the Navy did speak to the sailor in the video, officials made it clear that she would not be separated from the service for her actions. ? 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now Last week, as tensions increased following two highly publicized police shootings, another sailor came forward to say that she would be sitting out the national anthem as well: Ervin also said that she intended to ?support and defend the Constitution of the United States and to spread freedom and democracy around the world.? But she would do well to heed the observation of fellow African American Martin Baker who was reminded of something he was told in training: ?I was told in basic training the simplest of phrases: we are here to preserve and defend democracy, not practice it. When you put the uniform on, you must put aside your personal feelings and remember at that moment you are a direct representative of the United States of America. You are, if need be, the advanced diplomacy of the American way of life. If at any time you feel you cannot stand and represent our flag and our nation even in something as simple as the anthem, you forfeit the right to wear that uniform.? That is exactly right and it goes right to the heart of her transgression.Ervin actions could also be considered ?political speech?, which is also against military regulations. Because of these two incidents, the Navy has issued new guidelines: According to Navy Regulation 1205, personnel in uniform must stand at attention and face the flag when the national anthem is played. Navy active-duty personnel in civilian clothes will face the flag, stand at attention, and place their right hand over their heart. Additionally, Sailors will receive training on the appropriate usage of social media, and must not use it to discredit the Naval Service, and should be reminded it could potentially be used as evidence against them. While military personnel are not excluded from the protections granted by the First Amendment, the US Supreme Court has stated that the different character of our community and of the military mission requires a different application of those protections.? Neither of the sailors has been discharged? yet. But the new guidelines state that such actions will be punishable under Article 92 of the UCMJ and will be considered serious offenses ? grounds for involuntary separation from the service. As they should.Don enlist if youcan follow themilitary rules, regulations and laws.

"A 22-year-old Muslim man from Afghanistan proudly declared that he was a superstar in Afghanistan after he sodomized and orally raped a 2-year-old boy. The worst part is that he was only charged with sexual assault and only sentenced to two years in prison. TheUK Express reports: Jama B., 22, showed no remorse as he was sentenced to just two years and four months behind bars on the milder charge of sexual abuse of the four-year-old boy at the centre in Boostedt, Schleswig-Holstein. The toddler, from Iraq, was lured into a toilet cubicle at the home in March this year. The court heard the Afghani forced his penis into thechild mouth. Afterwards the distraught youngster was returned to his father with his trousers down around his ankles. During the trial Jama B. boasted: ?I?m a superstar in Afghanistan, a singer.? ? Judge Stefan Becker refused to comment on the verdict but Peter Boysen, the lawyer who represented the family of the child, said: ?it was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child. ?Therefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. I have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict.He better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist. Jama showed absolutely no remorse for his crime. A second man, Sohrab S., 29, allegedly stood guard outside the toilet during the assault, which was really rape. He was acquitted for lack of evidence. Prosecutor Axel Bieler said, ?Rape charges are brought only if it was enforced with violence or the threat of violence. We do not assume this was the case. ?Therefore he was indicted on a charge of serious sexual abuse. The penaltydoesn matter ? it is between two and 15 years in jail for rape or for serious sexual abuse.? Say what? How about the fact that it was forced and that it was upon a child? What kind of mind does Axel Bieler have? I can tell you it is not a critically thinking judicial mind for sure. Karin Witt is not better. The spokeswoman of the Kiel court said, ?The court found no reasons for an increased penalty, such as for example a criminal record for the accused. ?The fact that he was under the influence of alcohol and the high sensitivity towards detention of the offender were both factors in the sentence,? she added. ?He is young, knows no German and has already been attacked in pre-trial detention. The victim has also dealt well with the experience of what happened to him and there are no serious consequences to be expected.?What even worse is the comments by thefamily attorney. ?It was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child,? Peter Boysen said. ?Therefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. I have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict.He better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist. Really, Mr. Boysen? How about if this was your little boy? Would you still have the same cold-hearted response at this crime? I think not. Germans were outraged at the charges and the sentencing. ?The incredible verdict of the prosecutor and the court,? wrote the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. ?This is the verdict that shames you all.? People continuing to make excuses for criminal sexual crimes, especially for those who are most innocent among us are a part of the larger problem. Allowing the foreign god of Islam in what was once a Christian country is problematic enough. Excusing the pagans that practice the ideology of Muhammad and engaging in these kinds of crimes is just adding fuel to the fire.Don think itwon be happening in the united States either. Our own military kicked out Sgt. Charles Martlandfor defending a boy that was raped in Afghanistan and told other members of our military to keep silent about such abuses. Do you really think our representatives are going to stand up for the children whenthey allowed them to be slaughtered by the millions? I think not.

"Washington  A group of former national security officials and experts are calling on Donald Trump to disclose his overseas business dealings, questioning whether the Republican nominee has conflicts of interest with US foreign policy. More than 50 past officials signed the letter released Monday, a mix of Democratic and Republican national security leaders. The letter notes that Trump's business dealings overseas could pose ""unprecedented"" and ""significant conflicts of interest"" if he guided US foreign policy. It demands Trump disclose in full what his foreign business interests are, and to promise to divest himself of them if he wins in November. ""Our next commander-in-chief will inherit complex national security threats and complicated relationships with allies and adversaries alike,"" the officials wrote. ""But our policies must be motivated exclusively by what is in America's best interest, not by the financial interests of our president. The onus is on Donald Trump to assure voters that this will be the case by disclosing the nature of his overseas relationships and committing to divest such assets."" Signatories include Hillary Clinton supporters like retired Gen. John Allen and former Defense Undersecretary for Policy Michele Flournoy. Also signing were a number of former George W. Bush administration officials, including former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, former national security adviser Robert Blackwill, former Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Analysis Thomas Fingar and former acting CIA Director John E. McLaughlin. The letter shares some overlap with a missive from a group of 50 GOP national security officials who last month wrote a letter opposing the Republican candidate. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, saying they are under audit, and has given limited information about his businesses to the public. He has said he will separate himself from the business if he became president, leaving it in charge of his children. But experts tell CNN putting his children in charge would not do enough to minimize potential conflicts of interest. Trump has more than a dozen properties all over the world. The letter was first reported by The New York Times. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",0.019305019,0.0038610040000000003,0.0,0.007722008000000001,0.054054054000000004,0.301158301,0.0,2,-1,1

"Ican wait for ?Weekend atChelsea? to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of HillaryClinton slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups ? these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low ? would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a ?minor setback? to her inevitablevictory. The American peoplearen buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more ?conspiracy theory? dismissals. Mrs.Clinton ?mild cold,? er, ?seasonal allergies,? I mean ?heat exhaustion,? that is to say ?minor case of pneumonia? is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a ?mystery man? who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable episodes(or otherwise freezes up with a brain ?short-circuit? during a speech). This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures. Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms ofParkinson disease ? a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has pneumoniarequired a neurological squeeze test?). The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. Theywon, but they should. I wonder what official diagnosiswe?ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as thoughthey been there a hundred times before. ?Nothing to see here, folks. SecretaryClinton sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ?powered through? yesterday going door-to-door.? The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president.She proven, yet again, that shecan be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character.She a liar.That her default mode.She corrupt. Andshe sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else ? including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life. Do I take joy in Mrs.Clinton sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. ?Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice? (Proverbs 24:17). Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of DonaldTrump supporters as a racistand irredeemable?basket of deplorables,? has only served to accelerate the plunge. Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement ? especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her ?friend and mentor.? Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags ? the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.Who the racist?I praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. Youcan help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.It almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everythingshe ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BSshe put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, ?Many are the plans in aperson heart, but it is theLORD purpose that prevails.? Am I sayingthere no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up,there always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory. Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for HillaryClinton political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector ? a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee. When they visit her in prison.

"The campaign for Senate control increasingly looks like a flip-of-the-coin affair ? a 50-50 split after the election is not far-fetched. That could be a nightmare in the making for whoever wins the White House. Story Continued Below Any individual senator ? from Elizabeth Warren on the left to Ted Cruz on the right ? could almost single-handedly block the newpresident Cabinet picks, depending on which party is in power. If you think the past several years of Senate gridlock have been bad, that might look like a joy ride by comparison. ?It?ll be a whole new shooting match,? said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.). ?One of the concerns that I have is that [with] the rancor of this campaign, everybody will feel likeit still open season on whoever the elected president is,? said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.). ?I hope we can get beyond that.? TheSenate unique power over confirmations means the chamber will be called upon early and often to ratify the Cabinet selections of the new president, whetherit Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. The election outcome could have a big bearing on that: What once looked like a potential wave year for Democrats has tightened to the point that an evenly divided Senate has become a real possibility. That would leave virtually no margin for error when it comes to approving thepresident team next year. ?We?re looking at a Senate somewhere between 52 and 48. Probably the outside numbers are 48 for one side and 52 for the other,? said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), who himself is up for reelection. ?It could be a tied Senate.? That outcome would also present a new test for the relationship between Capitol Hill and the White House. The confirmation process has grown ever more partisan over the past 15 years, despite the move by Democrats to weaken the filibuster so that all nominees except those to the Supreme Court can be confirmed by a simple majority. The most likely Senate makeup is 51-49, or 50-50, in which case ties would be broken by the vice president. Democrats fear that even if Clinton wins but Republicans keep the Senate, the GOP would drag its feet on her Cabinet picks and hobble her administration out of the gate. ?If you have President Clinton and a Republican-controlled Senate, aswe seen with judicial appointments, the majority leader has the ability to obstruct virtually at will,? said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). ?By refraining from bringing nominations to the floor, that could single-handedly prevent the president from confirming her team.? Warning shots are already being fired. On Wednesday, Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, gave a speech at the Center for American Progress that included a sharp signal to Clinton not to pick insiders with ties to the financial industry for her administration. ?When we talk about personnel, wedon mean advisers who just pay lip service toHillary bold agenda, coupled with a sigh, a knowing glance and a twiddling of thumbs untilit time for the next swing through the revolving door,? Warren said. Moderates are already entertaining what it will be like next year to hold the keys toClinton Cabinet. Five senators from red states are running for reelection, and several from purple states will be up for reelection, and any one of them could accrue effective veto power over nominees who rub them or their state the wrong way. ?Senators who are up in 2018 are already talking about it,? said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). The Senate dynamics surrounding Supreme Court confirmations and legislation probablywon shift much, since they need 60 votes to move forward. Outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) recently urged Democrats to scrap the supermajority requirement even for bills if they win back the chamber. Butit unlikely the party would go there, at least for now. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), a stalwart liberal in the caucus, said he is cautiousabout dumping the 60-vote threshold on the legislative filibuster anytime soon. But ?if the Republicans are now into almost a decade of a lack of good faith and cooperation, then I think we have to reconsider everything,? Schatz said. He added: ?Most of us are not anxious to move in that direction, but if wecan function, then what is it exactly thatwe protecting?? Republicans say thatwon be necessary. ?I do hold out some hope that knowing [ascending Democratic Leader] Sen. [Chuck] Schumer the way I do ? he and I work well together ? that we can find ways to build consensus,? said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). ?It?s clear that votersdon like the direction of the country now.? Republicans say they hope to play nice on nominees, too ? even if Clinton is president. Butthere a lot of bad blood from the Obama era: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) kept Attorney General Loretta Lynch waiting for weeks last year and has refused this year to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. Democrats, for their part, changed theSenate rules and spent more than a year in the majority confirming lifetime judges over the objections of GOP leaders. GOP senators said in interviews that the best way for the White House to get in sync with the Senate is to begin voting on the least controversial judges and Cabinet positions and get in a rhythm ? rather than first take up nominees viewed as partisan or controversial. ?The first ones that they send up will set the tone for a lot of that,? said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the Senate Foreign Relations chairman. Selecting ?some radical,? he added, ?would not be a great way to start the process.? And there are a couple of remaining moderates in the GOP conference, most notably Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. She said that unless there are integrityissues with a nominee,she inclined to help confirm the person. That could be a lifeline for Senate Democrats if every confirmation vote turns into a squeaker. ?I hopewe not going to get into blocking Cabinet nominees for the sake of blocking them,? Collins said.",0.032786885,0.004098361,0.010928962,0.025956284,0.058743169000000005,0.288251366,0.0,2,-1,1
"Atlanta  Rev. Raphael Warnock crouched forward in a back pew here at Ebenezer Baptist Church and wondered what could have been. ""I'm not afraid of Johnny Isakson,"" said Warnock of his Republican senator, at times distracted by the decades-old, muffled recordings of Martin Luther King Jr.'s sermons that echoed in this historic sanctuary. ""I'm not interested in a symbolic candidacy. I would've run to win."" A few hours later, the Democrat who is challenging Isakson instead of him, Jim Barksdale, tried to evince that same optimism speaking to a group of supporters at a Tex-Mex restaurant in Gwinnett County. ""This is a winnable election. Don't let anyone tell you anything else,"" said Barksdale, a 63-year-old soft-spoken investment manager and political newcomer. ""I wouldn't be in it if I didn't think it was winnable."" Barksdale, however, trails Isakson by 16 points in a Monmouth University poll released Monday , even though Donald Trump is up only 3 points ahead of Hillary Clinton. Georgia is looking increasingly like a missed opportunity for Democrats trying to win back the Senate -- and many fault Barksdale himself. ""We were giving a godsend, I believe, with Donald Trump,"" said Barksdale supporter Leonard Ware as he waited for the candidate to speak in Gwinnett. ""If we had a stronger candidate, we could've taken that Senate seat."" For national Democrats, Barksdale's disappointing bid is part of a broader trend facing the party that came into 2016 with a favorable map of Senate races. In Ohio, Ted Strickland has been hampered by repeated gaffes and fundraising woes that have led national Democrats to essentially abandon a once-top candidate in the homestretch. Democrats have begun to make similar moves in Florida, where Patrick Murphy -- once a young, impressive recruit poised to flip a GOP seat -- has suffered dearly for embellishing his background and given Republican opposition researchers a trove of material. And here in Georgia, a half-dozen prominent Democrats passed on challenging Isakson, a decision that some in the party now rue. Even with the tight presidential race, Barksdale isn't trying to capitalize on any anti-Trump sentiment in Georgia. He didn't mention the GOP presidential candidate when meeting supporters campaigning Friday and barely addressed it until CNN asked him about the top of the ticket in an interview. That's a far cry from the Democratic playbook that has proved to be moderately successful in other Senate races. Democrats have tortured GOP incumbents like Ron Johnson in Wisconsin and Richard Burr in North Carolina for their embrace of the nominee, and the poll numbers show it. Part of his reticence is that Barksdale, a former Bernie Sanders-backer, says he believes there are issues where he agrees with Trump. And he predicted a slew of Barksdale-Trump voters this November. ""It's hard to imagine how somebody can pull the lever for Donald Trump on the Republican side -- who is so anti-the-establishment and anti-the-trade-things -- and then pull the lever for Johnny Isakson,"" Barksdale said. African-American gap Georgia Democrats have long seen their political viability as resting on the state's booming minority population, and Barksdale's campaign agrees. If he can consolidate the black vote and win 85% of the community's 2.1 million voters, Barksdale aides say, he can win. The problem, revealed in a walk along this city's historically African-American Sweet Auburn neighborhood: People don't know who he is. ""Black dude?"" asked Paul Jones, a registered Democrat sitting on a ledge outside an abandoned park here, asked about the white Barksdale. ""Oh, no, I don't know him."" Some here do know Isakson, and he is a revered figure in some pockets of Georgia's middle class. At a major Republican call center in Isakson's home base of Cobb County last week, nearly everyone calling on his behalf have some personal relationship with the two-term senator -- whether they teach his granddaughter at Sunday school or write to his personal email every few weeks. And a trio of prominent Democrats, former US Sen. Sam Nunn, former Gov. Roy Barnes, and current US Rep. David Scott have all publicly backed Isakson, snubbing their own nominee. Despite Trump's struggles -- especially among independent women in the suburbs -- Isakson's team is calm and confident, thanks primarily to the caliber of the man they are facing. Their main concern is how much Barksdale himself plans to invest his campaign. He has invested $3 million so far, and he declined repeated questions about how high that total would go. ""No question that our Democratic friends are kicking themselves, given how volatile the electorate has become, for not having recruited a candidate with a higher profile with a better set of policies and messages,"" said Heath Garrett, Isakson's chief strategist said at their campaign office. ""The flip is -- they have a candidate that's willing to write a check,"" added campaign manager Trey Kilpatrick. Man in the hat Aside from not going after Trump, Barksdale has had other missteps that have cost him. The list of grievances among Georgians against Barksdale is long: the time conservative radio ridiculed him for misspelling 'judgment' on his campaign website; his sparse public event and interview schedule, stripping him of needed exposure; and his inability to effectively consolidate the Democratic base. Barksdale is further to the left than the centrist Senate bid waged by Michelle Nunn in 2014, who was thought to be a good ideological fit for Georgia despite being walloped in an open-seat contest. His calling card -- the cotton Bailey flat caps that he wears each day -- has drawn criticism as well from Georgia power brokers. ""I get a lot of compliments on it,"" he said. ""Everybody was worried that it wouldn't appeal within the, let's call it, minority communities -- but it really does."" The cap has emerged as the signature emblem of Barksdale's laggard campaign, with one soft-focus television ad featuring Georgians securing his cap over their hair (""Could I give you a good look here?"" he told one grade-schooler here before revealing his balding head.) His office in littered in cap imagery, with supporters imploring Republicans to ""send the hat"" -- not Barksdale, or as some call him more forgivingly, ""the man in the hat"" -- to the Senate. National Republicans don't send trackers to his events and have barely advertised against him as well. Republicans concede that Isakson would have faced a stronger test if Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed, or rising star state Rep. Stacey Abrams, or presidential scion Jason Carter, had not so strongly resisted overtures from party leadership to run a race seen as winnable. ""I had conversations with folks who were thoughtful about their request, and I was speedy in my response,"" said Abrams as she awaited a flight. ""I was very unequivocal about the fact that I had no interest in running for the Senate."" ""I thought seriously about it and I came this close to running,"" said Warnock, who said he wanted to remain at his church. ""This was not my time."" Several Democrats pointed to trends that explained Democrats' candidate problems nationally -- poor showings in 2014 sapped ambition from some red-state hopefuls, while others made their decisions well before Trump's struggles. Democrats did not land their first-choice recruit in North Carolina, and others have not lived up to the hype that came with their entrances into the race. ""When you look at states like North Carolina, Missouri and Indiana -- which were places that no one thought were going to be competitive this time last year -- I think it speaks to the quality of the candidates that came forward,"" said DSCC spokesman Lauren Passalacqua, who would only characterize Georgia as ""another area that we think is competitive in a year when Republican have struggled."" Isakson, for his part, takes some credit for the Democrats' A-team declining to challenge him. ""I've made a lot of friends.

The other half want to vote for him. Trump started the debate in predictable fashion: bombastic, hostile, and totally without a modicum of integrity. And what was up with the constant sniffling? Perhapshe literally allergic to the truth. In any case, Trump continued his trend of inventing sh*t on the fly in almost combative fashion, so as to distract from the fact that he has absolutely no desire to do the serious work of being president. As expected, the first presidential debate devolved into a schoolyard argument as the hopelessly insecure bully Donald Trump repeatedly cut off Hillary Clinton. When it became clear that Trump was going to use this event to spread lie after lie, Clinton dropped the bomb.

"Story highlights The decision concerned an Ohio policy of removing voters from the rolls after 6 years of inactivity The ruling is a victory for groups who had argued the program violated the National Voter Registration Act (CNN) A federal appeals court ruled Friday that Ohio's method of removing names from its voter rolls violates federal law, and sent the case back to the district court for a remedy. The ruling by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals is a victory for the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio and other groups who had argued the program violated the National Voter Registration Act and expressed concern that the purge would effect ""many thousands"" of Ohio voters. They hope the lower court will move quickly to direct that names that were improperly removed should be put back on the voting list or that voters not on the list be allowed to file a provisional ballot. The appeals court said that Ohio's so-called ""Supplemental Process,"" where ""a voter is purged from the rolls after six years of inactivity -- even if he or she did not move and otherwise remains eligible to vote,"" is in violation of the NVRA. ""We are very happy that the court found that (Secretary of State Jon Husted's) process of purging voters in Ohio is illegal and must stop,"" Mike Brickner, Senior Policy Director at the ACLU, said in a statement.

"Donald Trump leads Hillary Clinton in Iowa 44 percent to 37 percent. | AP Photo Swing-state polls: Trump leads in Iowa, narrows the gap in Colorado and Virginia Donald Trump has taken the lead over Hillary Clinton in Iowa and narrowed the former secretary ofstate advantage in Colorado and Virginia, a new Quinnipiac University poll shows. The Quinnipiac poll of likely voters in the four swing states, released Thursday, asked respondents about a four-way presidential race that also includes Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Story Continued Below Trump, who trailed Clinton by 2 points in Iowa in an August Quinnipiac poll, now leads by 7 points, 44 percent to 37 percent. He also leads in Georgia, where likely voters also preferred him by a 7-point margin, 47 percent to 40 percent. Stein earned the support of 2 percent of respondents in Iowa and did not register any support in Georgia, while Johnson polled at 10 percent and 9 percent, respectively. Both the Clinton campaign and Priorities USA, a super PAC backing the former secretary of state, stopped airing advertisements for her in both Virginia and Colorado over the summer amid a seemingly insurmountable polling advantage. But the fresh Quinnipiac poll shows that advantage narrowed in both states. In Colorado,Clinton lead has shrunk from 8 points in mid-August to just 2 points in the most recent poll, 44 percent to 42 percent, with Johnson polling at 10 percent and Stein at 2 percent. Clinton's lead in Colorado falls within thepoll margin of error, putting the two candidates in a statistical tie in the state. In Virginia, the 9-point advantage Clinton held over Trump last month has shrunk to 6 points, 45 percent to 39 percent, in the poll released Thursday. Johnson earned the support of 8 percent of respondents from Virginia while Stein polled at 1 percent there. The new polls are the latest in an array of positive swing-state news for the Manhattan billionaire, who has polled well in purple states of late. A Fox News poll out Wednesday showed Trump with leads in Ohio, North Carolina and Nevada and a Suffolk University poll released earlier in the day Thursday put Trump narrowly ahead of Clinton. The news has been better for the former secretary of state in nationwide polls. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday afternoon put Clinton ahead of Trump by 6 points among likely voters across the country. But even if likely voters nationwide prefer Clinton, Trump could still carve a path to the White House with wins in key swing states. The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted from Sept. 13-21 via landlines and cellphones. It reached 644 likely Colorado voters and 638 Georgians likely to vote, both with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.9 points. The poll also reached 612 Iowans, with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4 points, and 659 likely Virginia voters, with a with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.9 points.",0.021390374,0.0,0.0,0.0026737970000000003,0.07486631,0.25133689800000003,0.0026737970000000003,1,-1,1
"Hillary Clinton bemoaned not just the two police-involved deaths from this week, but also violence against police that occurred last week in Philadelphia and Tuesday night in Charlotte. | Getty Clinton: Too many people have lost their lives in police encounters Hillary Clinton on Wednesday lamented the deaths of two African-American men this week by police officers, calling such killings unbearableand adding that they need ?to become intolerable.?Clinton remarks on the shootings, one in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and the other in Charlotte, North Carolina, came at the top of a speech that was billed as focusing on economic issues. But the former secretary of state told the Orlando, Florida, crowd that she felt compelled to address the news of the day. Story Continued Below ?There is still a lot wedon know yet about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African-Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,? she said. ?Look, I know Idon have all the answers. Idon know anyone who does. But this is certain: Too many people have lost their lives whoshouldn have.? Clinton bemoaned not just the two police-involved deaths from this week, but also violence against police that occurred last week in Philadelphia and Tuesday night in Charlotte. She balanced calls for an end to the killings of black men at the hands of law enforcement with praise for the police departments that handled a mass-stabbing attack in Minnesota and explosions in New York and New Jersey over the weekend. ?I?ve spoken to many police chiefs and other law enforcement leaders who are as deeply concerned as I am and as deeply committed as I am to reform. Why? Because they know it is essential for the safety of our communities and our officers,? she said. ?I?ve also been privileged to spend a lot of time with mothers who have lost children, and young people who feel that, as far as theircountry concerned, their lives seem disposable.We got to do better. And I know we can. And ifI elected president, we will.? From there, Clinton returned to herspeech stated topic: ?building an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.? She called for the inclusion of more women in the labor force, improved access to affordable education, and immigration reform, which Clinton said would help families and be a boon for the U.S. economy. But the former secretary of state spent the bulk of her speech calling for improved economic opportunities for Americans with disabilities, a group she said is ?too often invisible ? overlooked and undervalued.? As president, Clinton said she would seek to advance employment opportunities for those with disabilities and make higher education more accessible to them as well. She also called for the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. ?Men and women, boys and girls who have talents, skills, ideas and dreams for themselves and their families, just like anybody else. Whether they can participate in our economy and lead rich, full lives that are as healthy and productive as possible is a reflection on us as a country,? she said. ?And right now, in too many ways, we are falling short.We got to face that, and do better, foreveryone sake.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Scott posed an imminent danger to officers, and Officer Brentley Vinson, who is also African-American, shot the man.

I believe she was 19 and he was 30 at the time.That perfectly within the legal limits ifyou at a strip club, but Idon think a 30-year-old should be predatory towards a relationship with a 19-year-old. Especially ifhe unemployed andcan even provide for a family becausehe a loser. She wanted the lazy jobless Muslim OUT of their apartment. She wanted him away from her child. She wanted NOTHING to do with this Muslim man who would soon turn violent. Jamiv Usmandidn respond well to this. He was boiling over like a pot of hot water ready to soften egg noodles for dinner. Get the knife ready for the steak, because what happens next is absolute HORROR. After all her requests and demands for the psychopath Muslim to leave, he had the nerve to ask her for a drink of water. Sounds reasonable ifyou an employed Muslim providing for his woman, but thatwasn the case with this Allahu Akbar creep. She said no and he literally tipped over like that pot of boiling water and BRUTALLY stabbed her over 100 times with a knife. He stabbed so hard that he BROKE THE KNIFE IN HER NECK! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEARCLFBOt4 Rightwing News ? She wanted him out of her apartment and she told him to get out. Tensions were brewing and it eventually led Usman to stabReynold over 100 times. The last straw for Usman was when he asked her to get him a drink of water and she said no.That when he grabbed a big kitchen knife and plunged it into her body over 100 times in front of the toddler. He stabbed her so hard that he broke the tip of the knife in her neck. Amazingly, she survived. She played dead. He left. She crawled to a bus stop and got help. Eventually she healed and was able to identify her stabber and watch a judge order Usman to serve up to 20 years in prison. The good news is that this strong woman survived and recovered to see her Muslim attacker thrown to the wolves in prison. Hopefully the violent Muslim will serve his full 20 year sentence and learn his lesson in prison. Will he be shanked 100 times in the neck? Probably not. Those guys in prison know how to shank you once and make it count. The other 99 slashes would be for fun.

"Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Fla. poll: Clinton leads Trump, who's not believed about birther controversy MIAMI ? Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by 5 points in the newest Florida poll of likely voters, the latest in a series of topsy-turvy surveys that show the race shifting left, right and center by the day. MonmouthUniversity survey showing Clinton up 46-41 percent over Trump comes a day after a New York Times/Siena College poll that had the race essentially tied at 41-40 percent inClinton favor in a four-way contest that included the Libertarian and Green party candidates. Story Continued Below The Times/Siena poll had a larger sample, 867 likely voters, compared toMonmouth 400 sample that has an error-margin of 4.9 points. Both polls also showed Sen. Marco Rubio ahead of Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, withMonmouth survey showing theRepublican lead at a narrow 2 points. And the surveys showed that Clinton leads with non-white voters, while Trump is ahead with whites.Monmouth poll, however, does indicate the race has tightened. Last month, she led by 9 points. The new poll also indicates that votersdon believe Trump when it comes to his longstanding crusade to question PresidentObama status as a natural-born citizen qualified to be president. ?AlthoughClinton lead is smaller than in our last poll, she is maintaining her advantage in Florida given the ominous state of her poll standing last week,? Patrick Murray, the Monmouth University PollingInstitute director, said. ?Florida has become less of a crucial battleground now that the campaigns? attention has turned to the Rust Belt,? he said. ?However, a win here would make the path to 270 electoral votes that much easier for the victor and difficult for the loser.?Monmouth poll shows that three quarters of voters said they heard that Trump finally admitted that Obama was born in the United States. However, only 24 percent think Trump believes that Obama is a natural-born citizen; 54 percent said Trump made the admission for political expediency. Though Trump tried to implicate Clinton in the birther controversy, 47 percent said that theydidn believe she had a role in it; 35 percent believe she did ? and nearly all were Trump supporters. For the overwhelming majority of voters, 76 percent, the birther issuewon affect their vote; but 18 percent said it would make them less likely to support Trump and 4 percent said it would make them more likely to favor his candidacy. Trump tried to say that he has now ended the issue by way of his admission, but Democratsaren letting it go. They see the issue as paying two dividends for Clinton in the race: undercutting perceptions ofTrump honesty and juicing turnout among African-Americans upset that Trump crusaded for years to de-legitimize the first black president. ?If Trump wanted to put an end to his role in the birther controversy with his statement on Friday, it does not seem to have had the intended effect,? Murray said.

" The mistaken US-led coalition bombing of a Syrian military position Saturday may have happened because the personnel weren't wearing military uniforms and didn't have standard military weapons, several US military officials told CNN. Officials said they now think the personnel bombed may have been Syrian military prisoners, according to several US defense officials. That's a working theory of how US, British, Danish and Australian aircraft may have incorrectly assessed intelligence and targeted the site that killed more than 60 Syrian personnel near Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria. The UK Ministry of Defence is saying it used drones in the strike. Officials emphasized there are no final conclusions by the US about who was struck. Overhead imagery and interviews with those involved will have to be assessed. But the US is not disputing that Syrian personnel were hit. The US is trying to determine what specifically led to the mistaken strike and how the personnel may have been misidentified.

Ifwe lucky, we float through life never having to endure harrowing situations of life and death. However, too often, regularfolks become the target of criminals. Citizens are mugged walking down the street; they are awoken by shattering glass as their suburban castle is violated by intruders. While many people throughout the world must suffer at the hands of criminals, Americans enjoy the right to bear arms and are afforded the right to defend themselves. Early Friday morning, three armed men broke into a home in Georgia. A surveillance camera was running and authorities have released the tape to encourage the apprehension of two of the suspects. In the below footage, the trio breaks into a home filled with boxes. The occupant, a woman who reportedly is a restaurant manager who had stacked supplies for the restaurant in the home, can be seen promptly coming out of the bedroom in her pajamas with guns blazing. She began firing on the suspects almost immediately and as bullets ripped through the drywall, the robbers returned fire as they ran for their lives. One man even jumped through a window to escape the barrage of bullets. ? 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

" The so called ?small government? Republicans running the state of Michigan are so fond of letting communities run their own affairs thatthey blocked the city of Flint from being able to sue the state after theGovernor specially-appointed ?emergency manager? made a series of decisions that led to the mass poisoning of thousands with lead-tainted water. Just days afterFlint Mayor Karen Weaver indicated that her town might sue the state, Republican Governor Rick Snyder and his appointed five-man Receivership Transition Advisory Board changed the rules, preventing the city from suing without approval from the Advisory Board. House Speaker Kevin Cotter (R-Mt. Pleasant) complained that ?a reckless lawsuit could throw the state budget into disarray and undermine everythingwe done for the city.?They done quite enough to make the lives of Flint citizens worse already. Gov.Snyder senseless Tea Party tax cuts blew gigantic holes in the state budget, prompting him to appoint emergency managersto rule bankrupt cities without any oversight from local governments. Those managers then arranged the switch from the Detroit water system to the heavily polluted Flint River water, ostensibly to ?save money? but accusations of orchestrating a conspiracy to privatize the water company make the situation even murkier. Released emails showed that theGovernor office ignored and dismissed complaints from the concerned consumers, all the while charging them the most expensive water prices in the country and hiding the fact that their water was tainted with lead and other dangerous toxins for nearly a year after the administration had learned of the contamination. Now, the so-called ?small government? conservatives are blocking the city from seeking justice in the gross mismanagement and mass poisoning of its citizens.It a hypocrisy that has played out time and time again in red Midwestern states; Republican politicians scream and howl about the tyranny of the Obama administration but then decide to, say, ban cities in Oklahoma from banning fracking, where the land has become so unstable from fracking operations that earthquakes are now a weekly occurrence.It just another piece of evidence which shows that Republicans only exist to serve their corporate masters; theydon even pretend to respect the opinions and rights of the people they supposedly represent.

"The Republican presidential candidate leads the race in three swing states. | AP Photo Poll: Trump leads Clinton in Ohio, Nevada, North Carolina Donald Trump has pulled ahead of Hillary Clinton among likely voters in a trio of swing states, according to a Fox News poll released Wednesday evening. In a four-way race that also includes Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Trump leads Clinton 43 percent to 40 percent in Nevada, 45 percent to 40 percent in North Carolina and 42 percent to 37 percent in Ohio. Story Continued Below Johnson polled at 8 percent in Nevada and at 6 percent in both North Carolina and Ohio. The only state in which Stein registered any support was Ohio, where she polled at 2 percent. President Barack Obama won all three states in 2008 and took Ohio and Nevada in his 2012 reelection campaign. All three are essential for Trump, who faces a relatively narrow electoral path to the White House relative to Clinton. The Fox News poll is good news for the Trump campaign after a fresh NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released earlier Wednesday showed Clinton with a 6-point lead nationwide. The Fox poll also shows Republican Senate candidates in each state with leads over their Democratic opponents. The biggest advantage of the three belongs to incumbent Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, who leads former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland 51 percent to 37 percent. Another incumbent, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, leads Democrat Deborah Ross by 6 points, 43 percent to 37 percent, while GOP Rep. Joe Heck leads Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto by 7points, 43 percent to 36 percent, in the race to fill outgoing Senate Minority Leader HarryReid Nevada Senate seat. In NorthCarolina gubernatorial race, Republican Gov.

" A new video has emerged of the moments before and after police officers gunned down Keith Lamont Scott in North Carolina a few days ago. But the video, filmed byScott wife Rakeyia, does not show the exact shooting and still leaves many questions unanswered. The police video of the shooting has been seen by his mourning relatives. ?When told by police to exit his vehicle, Mr. Scott did so in a very calm, nonaggressive manner. While police did give him several commands, he did not aggressively approach them or raise his hands at members of law enforcement at any time. Mr.Scott hands were by his side, and he was slowly walking backwards? said family attorney Justin Bamberg. A picture has emerged that purports to show that Scott had a gun but it is still unclear who it belonged to or if it is a gun at all. In any case, North Carolina is an open-carry state with loose firearm laws, which more often than not seem to apply only to white people. In the video, the cops keep yelling ?DROP THE GUN? while Rakeyia Scott keeps telling them that hedoesn, and that what he does have is a traumatic brain injury and that he just took his medicine. ?Don?t shoot him.Don shoot him. He has no weapon. He has no weapon.Don shoot him!? she pleads as officers yell ? in an extremely unprofessional fashion ? ?DROP THE F*CKING GUN!? Why the officers were in a standoff with Scott at all is still unclear, as they were there to serve a warrant on someone else. But as happens far too often in the United States, Scott was executed without charges or trial. Protests by angry citizens demanding the release of the tapes continued into a third night as the governor declared a state of emergency and imposed a midnight to 6 am curfew. Police have continued to refuse to release the tapes as their investigationcontinues. Watch the video here.

"A racist Georgia man went completely off the deep end when faced with road work on his way home, threatening the construction crew with a gun while shouting racial slurs. Construction worker Nelson King said that on Thursday morning they were working on a section of road in Coweta County. Harold Bishop was on his way home when he came upon the portion of the road that had been closed for construction. The 72-year-old man then proceeded to completely freak the f*ck out and began waving around a gun while shouting racial epithets at the crew. ?He pulled up on us and he was like, ?Get these N-word off the road, I live here,I kill you N-word,?? King recalled. When Bishop pulled out his gun for the second time, King decided to start recording the incident while another man working at the scene called 911. According to the Coweta CountySheriff Office, Bishop then left the scene but returned before police showed up. King said he decided to record theman threats so that he would have proof of what was happening. ?If I can show proof that he pulled the gun out,? said King, ?police will get him.? It was a good thing King had decided to make the video of Bishop threatening them with his gun because when police showed up they saw him throw a beer out of the window and smelled alcohol on him, but they could not find the weapon.That when King whipped out the proof. ?I showed police the video and they seen the gun when he pointed it at us, they were like ohhe got to go,? said King. Bishop has been charged with charged with five counts of aggravated assault with a firearm, weapon pointing a gun at another, terroristic threats, DUI, and probation violation. He is currently being held without bond and is due in court on September 22.

"It?s no coincidence Donald Trump rolled out his child care proposal this week in suburban Philadelphia, with his daughter Ivanka by his side. To win Pennsylvania, the GOP nominee must remain competitive in the populous suburbs that ring thestate largest city. Recent polls suggesthe not even close. Story Continued Below And unless Trump can boost his performance on the outskirts of cities like Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Detroit and Columbus, Ohio ? particularly in the more affluent suburbs where middle-class women and college-educated white voters have eyed him askance ? he risks being overwhelmed by the large Democratic margins delivered by the nearby big cities. ?He?s played the white, working-class speech,? said Terry Madonna, a veteran Pennsylvania pollster, referring to the message Trump has aimed at working class white men in economically struggling communities. ?He?s not really made an appeal to [suburban] individuals.? The suburbs, where 47 percent of all votes were cast in 2012, went narrowly for Romney after voting narrowly for Barack Obama in 2008. This time around, with Trump doing little to tailor his message beyond his base of disaffected white men,he lagging far behindRomney performance. A Franklin and Marshall College poll in late August showed Hillary Clinton with a 45-31 advantage in the Philadelphia suburbs. An analysis from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel revealed drastic underperformance by Trump in suburbanMilwaukee Waukesha County, a conservative bastion where GOP candidates typically run up huge margins. While Trump led Clinton by 45 percent to 32 percent over the summer, he was far behindRomney pace there ? the 2012 GOP nominee carried Waukesha by 67 percent to 32 percent. The story is similar in Virginia, another swing state. According to an August Washington Post poll, Trump was running well behindRomney clip in the close-in D.C. suburbs and also in the Northern Virginia exurbs ? places like Loudoun County, a critical battleground that Obama won by 5 points in 2012. ?I think it's more a matter of tone than it is his platform,? said Val DiGiorgio, chairman of the Republican Party of Chester County, the only one ofPhiladelphia four main suburban counties that Romney won in 2012. ?We're a county where fiscal conservatives tend to do very well. If he could convince these folks that he's a fiscal conservative and acts more presidential, he could win over some of these voters. They dislike Hillary so intensely.? GOP leaders and pollsters say Trumpcan win without making inroads in the suburbs ? and voters there are turned off by his bluster and sometimes-erratic nature. But many also sayClinton unpopularity is keeping Trump in the hunt. ?There are some voters out there, they would prefer not to vote for Clinton, but they have yet to see Trump as a viable alternative,? added John Brabender, a GOP strategist who helped steer Rick Santorum to a Senate victory in Pennsylvania. ?Trump can still take advantage of it. Trump needs to show a comfort level from a personality and temper standpoint.?Trump temperament has been a persistent issue throughout the campaign ? nowhere more than in the suburbs ? but there are signs an image makeover is underway. Aside from his uneven attempts to moderate some positions, eschew some of his harsher rhetoric and hew more closely to a script with the use of a TelePrompter, the campaign has been dispatching his children and their spouses to the critical suburban counties that could decide his fate. On Sept. 11,Trump daughter-in-law Lara made an unannounced stop in Painesville, Ohio ? in suburbanCleveland Lake County ? for a 9/11 memorial event.She also been active in her native North Carolina, where she reportedly helped open a field office in the Charlotte suburbs.She also joiningTrump other women surrogates to help soften his image in these key communities.Trump daughter, Ivanka, stood alongside her father to unveilTrump new child care plan in Delaware County, a Democratic-leaning suburb of Philadelphia,.She also arranging a trip to Colorado next week ? after a Saturday visit to the Denver suburbs by her father ? for a series of events. Last week, Donald Trump Jr. was also in Colorado too for events in downtown Denver ? one with millennials, one with sportsmen ? before heading north for a fundraiser in Windsor. The campaign is also in talks to send one of the Trump kids next month to Chester County, another crucial suburb outside Philadelphia, when the local GOP holds its fall reception. Trump supporters view the candidate's children as highly effective surrogates who can smooth some of themogul rougher edges and articulate (or talk around) some ofTrump harsher policies and rhetoric, the central challenge Trump has faced to making inroads in the suburbs. ?The important thing is thatyou sending people that connect with people in the community,? said Robert Blaha,Trump Colorado campaign chairman. ?Ivanka coming and talking to young millennial women -- like the role she played last night on the stage ? the more you can connect with those groups, the more people can understand the candidate.? The suburbs, of course,aren a monolithic voting bloc. WhileTrump struggles appear most acute in the affluent suburbs and among minorities in more mature suburbs,he actually well-positioned to make gains in some of the more industrial suburbs, which are prevalent in Ohio. ?A lot of suburbs have mini Rust Belts within them, and the same sort of angry, white working class voters have found Trump appealing,? said Larry Levy, executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University. ?When you add it all up, the give and the take, Trump is almost certainly going to do worse than prior Republicans. A big tiebreaker is the number of new immigrants and other minorities, are the fastest growing population bloc in many suburbs.? In Ohio, Levy noted, the Cleveland suburbs are riper targets for Trump because of their industrial tilt, while the Columbus suburbs are full of those more affluent white voters thathaven warmed to Trump. Suburban Republican leaders say that even in places where Trump may be lagging behindRomney performance, they see some recent evidence his fortunes may be improving. ?Our polling indicates he's down among the more affluent, suburban part of the county,? DiGiorgio, the Chester County chairman, said. ?I'd say he's rebounded since then. He's probably still losing Chester County.? Dale Fellows, chairman of the Cleveland-area Lake County GOP, saidhe seen an uptick in support for Trump among women. He noted the recent visit by Lara Trump, who was accompanied by Trump surrogates Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, the YouTube personalities who go by the names Diamond and Silk. ?Republican women are starting to become more engaged,? he said. ?That?s, I think, going to make a big difference in the outcome of the election.? InVirginia Loudoun County, outside of Washington D.C., Trump is still working to put his base together. ?I?ll be honest,that somethingthat still happening,? said Will Estrada, chairman of the county GOP. But he points to what he views as some optimistic signs ? from a mad rush to claim Trump lawn signs to a decision by longtime Trump hater and prominent conservative radio host Mark Levin, a resident of the county in Leesburg, to relent and announce his support for Trump. ?Every day that gets closer to Election Day,we seeing the base come on board with Donald Trump,? he said.",0.019736842,0.009868421,0.006578947,0.012061404,0.037280702,0.25877193,0.0,2,-1,1
"Bob McDonnell: 'I?ve got my PhD in suffering' Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, whose conviction on corruption charges was overturned by the Supreme Court last June, toldMSNBC ?Morning Joe? on Friday that ?I?ve got my PhD in suffering.? ?You learn more in life through suffering than you do success, andI learned a lot,? the former Virginia governor told host Mika Brzezinski. Story Continued Below McDonnell, once considered a candidate to join the 2012 Republican presidential ticket as MittRomney running mate, was convicted in 2014 on 11 corruption-related felony counts stemming from the over $175,000 in gifts and loans the former governor and his wife accepted from Virginia businessman Johnnie Williams. Those gifts included vacations, designer clothing and a Rolex watch. But McDonnell contended that those gifts and loans had never prompted him to provide any special treatment for Williams. On Friday, McDonnell said ?there was never any quo? in the quid pro quo case that the prosecution built against him. Thegovernor conviction was overturned unanimously by the Supreme Court last June. Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote thecourt opinion in the decision, said prosecutors had relied on a ?boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute? and added that ?setting up a meeting, calling another public official, or hosting an event does not, standing alone, qualify as an ?official act.?? McDonnell admitted that the case had been difficult on his family but also noted that four of his grandchildren were born during the legal process surrounding his case. Two of them, he said, were born shortly after court hearings and all of their births ?were a sign to me there is a bright future on the other side of this and things are going to be okay.? He said that even though he complied withVirginia laws, he regretted taking ?my eye off the ball? in monitoring what gifts his family members had received. He also admitted that accepting a business loan from Williams was ?a big red flag? and ?probably not good judgment on my part.? ?I'm glad to be vacated, but I have done a deep dive of my entire life, 62 years. What have I done right, wrong? How can I be a better person?? he said. ?So now that I'm on the other side of it, I think it's been an experience worth going through.

"Story highlights Experts have pinpointed Russian government-affiliated hackers as the source of cyberattacks Communications and documents stolen in those hacks on Democrats have been selectively leaked online Washington (CNN) The top Democrats on Congress' intelligence committees boldly blamed Russian intelligence agencies for a series of hacks designed to influence the US presidential election. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein and California Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking members on the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, respectively, released a joint statement on Thursday calling out Russian President Vladimir Putin and his government. ""Based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the US election,"" the Democrats said. ""At the least, this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes of the election -- we can see no other rationale for the behavior of the Russians."" Unlike past hedged comments from US lawmakers and officials, the statement was definitive and more forceful than any previous assertions about Russian hacking from top-level government sources. And in tying the hacking directly to Putin and/or senior levels of Russian government, the Democrats were more forceful than the administration or Congress has been in the past. ""We believe that orders for the Russian intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from very senior levels of the Russian government,"" Schiff and Feinstein said. ""We call on President Putin to immediately order a halt to this activity. Americans will not stand for any foreign government trying to influence our election.

"When the Miami Dolphins have their first home game of the season Sept. 25 against the Cleveland Browns, they might not have their customary police escort to the stadium.

" Hillary Clinton proposed on Thursday a new series of progressive taxes that would raise rates on thenation ultra-rich. The most significant of her new proposals calls for raising the top estate tax rate to 65% from the current 40%, a move that would generate about $260 billion in new government revenue over the next decade. Clinton had already proposed raising the rate on some millionaires to 45%, but her new plan, drawing heavily on that of her social democratic primary challenger Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT), would be even more progressive. Three new estate tax brackets would be added under the new system: a 50% rate for couples with estates valued over $10 million, a 55% rate for couples with estates valued over $50 million, and a 65% rate for couples with estates valued over $1 billion. Although the Trump campaign predictably railed against an ?even higher hike in the death tax,? only an infinitesimal number of incredibly wealthy Americans would be affected by the new rates. According to IRS data only 223 estates with taxable value over $50 million filed estate tax claims in 2014, and there are fewer than 1,000 people in the entire country who would ever be subjected to the highest rate. This very minimal burden on a tiny number of families that are more than able to shoulder it would pay forClinton proposed simplification of small business taxes and expansion of the child tax credit, programs that will millions of Americans. While cynical Republican demagogues have painted the estate tax as an oppressive punishment for small businesses, couples with less than $5.5 million in assets ? or 99.8% of the nation ? pay no estate tax at all. The rhetorical acrobatics and outright lies required to convince the average American that they are at risk from the so-called ?death tax? is astounding. In reality,Clinton proposed hikes would actually lessen the tax burden on small businesses by financing a simplification of the business tax code. All in all,Clinton tax proposals would generate about $1.5 trillion in new revenue over the next decade, with the vast majority of the burden falling on the super-rich. Donald Trump, in contrast, has called for eliminating the estate tax entirely and slashing taxes by $12 trillion over the next decade, a move that most reasonable economists agree would cause a severe recession and eliminate a staggering 3.5 million jobs. The Clinton campaign reportedly collaborated with Sen. Sanders? former economic advisers to produce the new estate tax plan, and indeed it is almost identical to Sanders? primary proposal.Today announcement was thus one of the most concrete examples ofClinton shifting leftward in an attempt to win over skeptical progressives who supported Sanders in the primary. Sanders himself praised the proposal and released a statement endorsing it, saying that ?Secretary Clinton understands that it is appropriate to ask the top three-tenths of 1%, the very wealthiest people in this country, to pay their fair share of taxes so that we can provide a child tax credit for millions of working families and lower taxes for small businesses.?

" This Sunday, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick once again knelt in protest of police brutality during the national anthem of another NFL game. The very next day, video of yet another African-American being shot to death by police went viral, notwithstanding the fact that the victim, 40-year-old, Terence Crutcher, was unarmed and had his hands up at the time of his death. ?His car was broken down, he was looking for help and he got murdered,? Kaepernick said. ?That?s a perfect example of what [my protest] is about. I think it will be very telling what happens with the officers that killed him becauseeverybody eyes will be on this.? The day after the footage ofCrutcher murder was released, the response immediately affected Charlotte, North Carolina as riots spread throughout thearea poorest neighborhoods. Kapernick took to Twitter to lament the tragedy and reassert his position, but his argument had already been proven for him in the worst way by police. With his protests, Kaepernick originally brought more attention to his disrespect for ?the flag? than to police brutality due to themedia fixation with his kneeling during the national anthem. But the death of Terence Crutcher served as a reminder of the point, the ruthlessness with which police treat people of color in America. ?There?s a lot of racism in this country disguised as patriotism,? Kaepernick said, ?and people want to take everything back to the flag butthat not whatwe talking about.We talking about racial discrimination, inequalities and injustices that happen across this nation.? According to the Guardian, 1,146 people were killed at the hands of the police last year. So far in 2016, police have killed more than 706 people according to the Washington Post and 790 according to the Guardian. And sinceKaepernick protest began, police have killed at least 67 people. Of these numbers, an unevenly high percentage of those killed by police have been African-Americans. And while the number of incidents with police would suggest a high likelihood of indictment of aggressors, police are almost never convicted of wrongdoing in cases involving police officers, even when there is video evidence of lawbreaking. All of this points away from an isolated event and towards a larger institutional issue with American law enforcement. And as the tally climbs higher every day, it becomes easier and easier to expose the faux-patriotism used to critique of Kaepernicks? protest, as just another way to avoid having a serious conversation about racial injustice in this country and to punish a person of color for daring to question the status quo.

"Donald Trump and then-wife, Ivana, pose aboard their yacht in New York City on July 4, 1988. | AP Photo Judge rejects New York Times request to unseal Trump divorce file A New York judge has rejected a media request to make public the contents of a 25-year-old court file on Donald Trump's divorce from wife Ivana, saying the courts have no business deciding what information could be useful to voters. The New York Times and the Gannett newspaper chain filed a motion to unseal the records, arguing the move was needed to contribute to public debate over the real estate mogul and Republican nominee's fitness for the presidency. Story Continued Below Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Frank Nervo rejected that argument in a ruling released Thursday. ""Were the court to make the confidential records available for journalistic, and thus public, scrutiny, it would impermissibly inject itself into the political process by making the value judgment of what information is useful in determining the present candidate's, or any other candidate's, fitness for office,"" Nervo wrote. ""The court's role in the electoral process is strictly limited to determining whether a candidate complies with the Election Law. The court will not take an action that exceeds that limitation."" Earlier this month, lawyers for both Donald and Ivana Trump filed legal papers opposing the unsealing. The GOP presidential nominee argued that New York's legislature has put divorce files off-limits in most circumstances. His ex-wife agreed, but also contended that since she is not running for office, she should not have to sacrifice her privacy even if the court found an enhanced interest in her husband's actions. Her submission to the court noted published reports alleging that she claimed during the divorce that he had raped her. However, Ivana Trump's brief said that was not her view and dismissed those reports as ""previous misinterpreted statements and allegations.? The judge agreed with Ivana Trump that there was no reason to intrude on her privacy. ""The court is obviously aware that one of the parties, who opposes this motion, is a presidential candidate. The court is also aware that the other party, who also opposes this application, is not seeking public office,"" Nervo wrote. ""If the court were to deprive the candidate party of his rights...on the ground that there may be something in the confidential file that would be useful in determining his fitness for office, that ground does not exist in the case of his former wife, who is not a candidate."" A lawyer for the news outlets, David Schulz, said no immediate decision had been made about whether to appeal. ""We are pleased with the Court's well-reasoned decision and order,"" Trump lawyer Marc Kasowitz said. Nervo's conclusion that judges shouldn't try to judge information's utility to voters is not universally shared on the bench. Several judges handling federal Freedom of Information Act lawsuits seeking information about Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state have cited the upcoming election as a reason to speed release of records held by the State Department.",0.035911602,0.0027624309999999997,0.008287293000000001,0.013812155,0.080110497,0.306629834,0.0,2,-1,1
"Washington  Six days before the crucial first presidential debate, Donald Trump is using a spate of bombings and stabbings to build an interlocking argument on two issues where he thinks tough talk gives him a winning hand -- immigration and terrorism. The attacks over the weekend mercifully did not kill anybody -- but they inevitably put the fear of terrorism back at the center of the showdown between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. From Trump's point of view, the new terror scares play directly into a vision of a nation under siege and which he must get Americans to buy into if he is to win in November. ""We cannot let this evil continue,"" Trump said in Florida on Monday after the capture of a US naturalized citizen of Afghan descent suspected of planting a series of bombs in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, and the stabbing of nine people in a separate attack in a Minnesota mall on Saturday in an attack claimed by ISIS. ""If you chose Donald Trump, these problems are going to go away."" Still -- Trump's hard bore approach does carry risks. His Democratic rival Hillary Clinton is also maneuvering in the wake of the attacks, portraying herself as the kind of steely and calm commander-in-chief Americans traditionally turn to in times of crisis. ""I know how to do this,"" Clinton said at an airport news conference on Monday. Trump is presenting the attacks as the result of what he says are lax, weak anti-terrorism policies pursued by President Barack Obama and his Democratic foe Clinton while she was secretary of state. And he's offering a solution: that the new threat of homegrown Islamic terrorism could be snuffed out if only the United States adopted the kind of ""extreme"" vetting of foreigners and drastic changes to the immigration system that he proposed and which lit a fire under his presidential campaign. ""Hillary Clinton's decisions overseas have left us with the threat we face today and her immigration policies will invite this threat onto our shores, and it's already happening,"" Trump said Monday. ""Let me state very clearly, immigration security is national security."" Trump is also likely to seize on the fact that Ahmad Khan Rahami, the accused New York bomber, a US naturalized citizen of Afghan descent, had spent time in Afghanistan and Pakistan in recent years to renew his call for a halt on immigration to the US from nations with proven links to terrorism. Though Trump's plans might not have prevented Rahami from visiting South Asia, where thousands of law abiding US citizens travel every month, Rahami's travels will play into the febrile political atmosphere that Trump is trying to tap into following the attacks. And revelations Monday that at least 858 people that had been ordered deported or removed under another name were improperly granted US citizenship due to a failure to maintain adequate fingerprint records, according to a new report, will be used by critics of the immigration system to bolster his claims of the need for reform. Trump's tough response to the terror attacks is likely to be a hit with his faithful supporters who have responded to such a message before -- for instance after attacks in Paris, San Bernardino California and Orlando which helped to shape the Republican primary process. But it's a gamble because while some Americans like the tough talk, he risks exacerbating impressions that with his vehement response to terrorist attacks, he is exhibiting the deficiencies that have many other voters wondering whether he is fit to be president. It's also unclear whether the limited human toll of the weekend's attacks will dilute their impact on an election still 49 days away -- in an election season in which the narrative often seems to shift by the hour. For instance, the huge campaign controversies of recent days -- Trump's false claim that Clinton was to blame for accusations that Obama was not born in the United States and the Democratic nominee's health issues dominated campaign conversation for days last week -- but barely got a mention on Monday. Voters also appear conflicted on the how national security will factor into the election. A CNN/ORC poll this month showed that voters trust the Republican more to tackle terrorism, by 51% to 45%. But the same survey found that voters think Clinton has the superior temperament required of a president (56% to 36%) and is better able to handle the responsibilities of commander in chief (50% to 45%). Trump's potential temperamental vulnerability came into focus during his Florida rally, when he bemoaned the medical treatment offered to Rahami after he was injured in a shootout with police. ""He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world. He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he will probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer,"" Trump said. But New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Clinton supporter, pointed out that what Trump was proposing was a wholesale repudiation of the humanitarian, civic and legal values for which the US stands -- a factor that could give some voters pause when they consider handing the White House to Trump."" ""Welcome to America,"" Cuomo told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""We have a system of jurisprudence, you are innocent until you proven guilty, you have a right to counsel, you have a right to hospitalization if you are ill. That is our system and it's what makes this country special. And what makes this country great."" The Clinton campaign, for its part, has long believed that in the unwanted circumstances of an ""October Surprise"" terror attack, voters would turn to experience and a steady hand rather than Trump's more impulsive leadership. ""I have sat at that table in the Situation Room, I have analyzed the threats, I have contributed to actions that have neutralized our enemies. I know how to do this,"" Clinton said during her news conference. While Trump responded to the fears of Americans, Clinton issued a call to their intellect. ""We should also launch an intelligence surge to help identify and thwart attacks before they can be carried out. We need to work more closely with Silicon Valley and other partners to counter terrorist propaganda and recruitment efforts online,"" Clinton said, repeating policies she has long embraced.",0.033240997,0.005540166,0.008310249,0.016620499,0.055401662000000004,0.33656509700000004,0.015235456999999999,2,-1,1
"Three significant events occurred on Capitol Hill this week. John Stumpf, CEO of Wells Fargo, was grilled by the Senate Banking Committee over unethical and potentially illegal account management practices at his bank. John Koiskinen, head of the IRS, appeared before a House impeachment hearing to answer for destruction of evidence and obstruction charges from House Republicans. We also saw Heather Bresch, Mylan CEO, appear before another House committee in response to an investigation into the flurry of Epipen price gouging accusations. In each case, the common response from the senior person in charge was, ?I take full responsibility for . . .?, followed by a delineation of the problems, excuses and diversionary issues that are obvious to anyone looking at their particular quandary. Yes, CEO Stumpf was RESPONSIBLE for the actions of Wells Fargo bankers who opened 2 million fake accounts. He was, in fact, the CEO, and those individuals all reported up through his AOR (area of responsibility). Yes, Director Koiskinen did head up and was RESPONSIBLE for the IRS during a time when Cogress was reviewing the practice of delaying conservative non-profit tax determinations and destruction of evidence under subpoena in the IRS. The individuals who trashed hard drives, delayed FOIA requests and pled the 5th in response to sincere congressional inquiries did, in fact, report up to him. Yes, Ms. Bresch is RESPONSIBLE for the entirety of pricing decisions and financial results at Mylan as its CEO. Whoever determined that the Epipen should be repriced up to $800 from $300, when Mylan holds the sole injection delivery patent and can produce the only generic option, did, in fact, work in the organization for which CEO Bresch was responsible. What was largely ignored in each of their congressional inquiries is the difference between RESPONSIBILITY and ACCOUNTABILITY. One can be responsible for overseeing the actions of those who report to them, but being accountable is a completely separate issue. For too long, and in too many positions of leadership, particularly in the public, non-market sector, the person in charge who was responsiblehas not been held accountable.It well documented how difficult it is to fire a federal employee, despite how many hours they spent watching porn in their cubicle, or how many VA appointment records they falsified. The private sector andit free-market mechanisms are more effective at isolating accountability to individuals. However, it is is equally well-documented that a corporate firing normally comes attached with a public statement of ?early retirement? and a comfortable golden parachute to soften the landing for the exited executive. Rarely, are corporate and public leaders truly held accountable for the actions and results over which they are responsible. As Senator Warren delivered her strong and rightful rebuke of Stumpf, it should be noted that she could similarly be asked, ?where are my promised $2500 savings from Obamacare?, ?why did I have to give up my doctor on passage of the AACA??, ?how do you explain the $20 trillion in national debt my as yet unborn grandchildren now own??, ?why is the VA still mistreating our veterans??, etc.It easy to be responsiblefor something . . . once elected or landed in position, to sit in a corner office and collect a nice paycheck and guaranteed pension, while telling someone else what to do, all the while hiding behind bureaucracy, complicated regulations and processes, human resources and legal staffs, and corporate and government committees.It far different to be ?accountable?, and made to personally and individually own the results of the actions which occurred onone watch or direction. One might define bureaucracy as the textbook example of ?responsibility with accountability.? If so, then the reverse would be ?accountability without responsibility?, which many would say is what happened to the fired bankers at Wells Fargo. Some would also describe that as terrifying. America at its best functioned under the idea of individual responsibility ? hard work, gaining an education, making wise choices, providing for oneself and family, pursuing the American Dream, and being a productive member of your community and society. Under individual responsibility, one has to own the results of their actions, accept accountability ? consequences ? for their shortfalls and mistakes, and then decide how to move forward. A running back, given responsibility to hold onto the football, who has a fumbling problem will find himself experiencing the consequence (accountability) of getting to sit on the bench. A bank robber who takes the responsibility of relieving the local branch of their cash will normally be held accountable for their actions in a Federal penitentiary. As the ideas of collective responsibility, corporatism and crony capitalism have taken root ? closely tied to the expanding power of the public sector, in government, academia and the closely-aligned media, and the growing interconnectedness of private and public enterprise ? individuals are absolved of the consequences of their individual actions and can hide behind the system, the process, the complexities, the nuanced views, and the collective weight of administrative machinery that grinds down any effort to reward or place accountability on the individual. The private sector retains many aspects of individual responsibility, as we saw this week in the willingness of Mr. Stumpf and Ms. Bresch to appear before the inevitably-hostile congressional panels. They made gallant efforts to defend their respective corporate positions, knowing they would have a board of directors to report back to, and legal departments anxious to avoid class-action suits based on theirCEO public comments. In each case, though, neither Stumpf, Koiskinen or Bresch understood the notion of accountability. Saying ?I?m sorry this happened?isn enough. Saying ?we?ll make it right?doesn cut it. Promising that ?we?ll do better next time? is a hollow statement. Yes, they should each be sorry and filled with personal sorrow.Let hope they are sincere in the promising of refunding fees and repairing the shattered credit of thousands.Let even assumethey fix the 501c3 application process, quit destroying records under subpoena, and make the price of life-saving Epipens affordable to every Family. Those are all actions for which they are responsible, they control the budgets, organizations, plans and activities of their enterprises,and as the senior leaders, they can personally make those actions happen.There still the matter of accountability . . . consequences. Mr. Stumpf, careers were ruined and lives were thrown into turmoil by the actions of Wells Fargo, for which you were responsible and, not coincidentally, you and many others profited enormously. Mr. Koiskinen, you allowed the IRS to subvert the will of the people to oversee and correct the oppressive actions of thegovernment most-feared agency, while retaining your position, power and pension. Ms. Bresch, under your watch and your authority, Mylan took advantage of countless families with no other options, earning millions for your company and yourself. You were all responsible. Now, how will you be held accountable? That remains to be seen. Even among our most revered and senior leaders, responsibility is rarely joined with accountability. Hillary ?took responsibility? for the Benghazi disaster and deaths of four Americans, her home-brew email server spewing classified secrets, and forgetting scores of classified briefings. Nowshe running for President. Four brave Americans were accountable and took on the consequence for our potential futurepresident actions or indecision. Spare us for thinking that personal accountability is a rare concept in 21st Century America.

"Story highlights Trump praised the policing practiced under former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani He also seized on the unrest to appeal to African-Americans to join his campaign Pittsburgh (CNN) Donald Trump called Thursday for a ""national anti-crime agenda"" to combat violent crime in US cities as he condemned the unrest that unfolded overnight in Charlotte, North Carolina, where protests turned violent. ""Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world's leader. How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities,"" Trump said during a speech here to a conference of shale oil and natural gas producers. After police shot a man officials say was armed, two nights of protests followed there, slipping into violence Wednesday night with numerous civilian and police injuries reported, as well as looting and property destruction. Trump, who has focused on restoring ""law and order"" in his presidential campaign, seized on the unrest in Charlotte to renew his call for tough-on-crime policies to bring down crime rates in major American cities and once again appeal to African-Americans to join his campaign. ""The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities where crime is so rampant,"" Trump said. ""There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration, ever, ever.""

"After Mondaynight debate, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks to viewers at a debate-watch party at The Space at Westbury, New York. | Getty Clinton team celebrates a win Democrats? jitters eased as she scores points and finds attack lines to carry into the next debates. HEMPSTEAD, N.Y.?Hillary Clinton plays chess. Donald Trump plays craps. Chessisn for everyone. It takes a long time. It's complicated. The chess team has a tendency to get beat up. Craps is fun. It's thrilling. Maybe you win big. Maybe you lose. But in the moment, what a show. Story Continued BelowClinton campaign wanted the debate to make the many millions of people who watched think hard about each candidate aspresident matter what happens, ?We win because more people are watching,? deputy communications director Christina Reynolds said two hours before the lights went up on Lester Holt. And they wanted a real-time test of their organization versusTrump, both in a war room that drowned reporters in prepared emails and several times got so loud with cheers that aides missed parts of the debate and in a spin room that matched billionaire Mark Cuban, Obama mastermind David Plouffe and Brigadier General John Douglass against Don King, wandering around in his Mt. Rushmore airbrushed denim jacket and American and Israeli flags, and a couple of cable news talking head supporters like A.J. Delgado. She moved in her pawns, her rooks, her bishops. He rolled the dice, shot them across the table. Her gambits worked. ?He was rattled that he had trouble competing in the arena,? said Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook. ?He became unhinged.?Clinton campaign lined up this debate as the most important but just first volley in what will be a sustained attack through the second debate in St. Louis and the third in Las Vegas. And her allies were immediately daring Trump to try squelching on showing up for those, ashe flirted with. Even Trump acolyte Rudy Giuliani was admitting afterward that itdidn go well and her team is now hoping that will goad the Republican nominee into another edition of blaming trusting aides over his own instincts, and coming into the next debate with a different demeanor. ?It?s hard. We saw with Al Gore, we had three different Al Gores,? Plouffe said afterward. ?Thatdidn work out so well.? Her team sees a number of winning lines coming out of the debate to carry into the next: Trump was a mess on birtherism (works with African-Americans, and anyone who loves President Barack Obama), his answer on his tax returns could be interpreted as that hedidn pay taxes at all in any year (works with middle class swing voters and any hesitant Republican-leaning independent wondering whathe hiding), he talked about his own business interests more than any jobs plan (works again with those middle class voters, particularly the college educated women that have been wavering a whole lot more than Clinton can be comfortable with). But Trump's appeal is to anyone who thinks flailing rage at the system is fine if that cracks a system thatisn working. Every time he seemed prepared with a line, it was to point out how long Clinton had been around and not solved the problems she was talking about. ?Hillary has experience, butit bad experience,? Trump said, finally getting across his point after the clock had already run past the 90-minute mark. Clinton tried to keep the focus only on the flailing. Her aides said he made that easier thanthey prepared for Monday night. ?He was baited even when youdidn try to bait,? said Clinton top adviser Jennifer Palmieri, who sat in on many ofClinton prep sessions.Trump debate prep was enough that he kept himself to calling his opponent ?Secretary Clinton? instead of ?Hillary,? at least for the first half of the night, but not enough to hold himself back from yelling interruptions at her, or being caught prickly on her raising questions about the money his father gave him to start his business, and apparently unwilling to get a more convincing answer on whatever he wants to call his current position on birtherism. The Clinton campaign and the Obama alums, scarred from the president flubbing it in his first debate in 2012 against Mitt Romney, were horrified about a repeat, and with a weaker candidate. They walked out of Hofstra feeling good. But the most important constituency that Clinton may have hit on Monday night: what Rep. Xavier Becerra, spinning for Clinton here at Hofstra afterward joked are the ?perpetual freaker-outers,? or nearing 100 percent of the Democratic electorate who keep poll websites on constant refresh and have been cornering the market on Xanax prescriptions as the national numbers have tilted more and more toward Trump. ?I don't think Trump fell on his face, but she pushed back in a really strong and measuredway I think is important,? said Mitch Stewart, battleground states director forObama reelection campaign, who was watching from home as a supporter of but not affiliated with Clinton. ?She also came across asfriendly more so than Trump. She was likable in this debate and maybe that is the most important thing for her to accomplish.? Plouffe, who spent all his years with Obama laughing off the ?bedwetters,? laughed again Monday night when asked if Clinton had gotten them under control. ?That?s a hard thing to fix,? he said. ?Did she give Dems more reason to go out and knock doors? Did she give some Democrats whodidn know if they were going to vote in this election, I think she did. But I also think she did quite a bit of good with moderate swing voters.? ?She gave Democrats a lot of reason to calm down,? Plouffe said. ?Butthat how we are.? ?It was an awesome night for Democrats,? said DNC member Robert Zimmerman, as he headed out of the debate space Monday night. ?There?ll be no bedwetting for 12 hours.?",0.032716927,0.00284495,0.012802276000000001,0.007112376,0.054054054000000004,0.268847795,0.0,2,-1,1

"Michigan has become a hotbed of hate as Muslims have been allowed to take over much of the state and impose their ?religious rights? on everyone who was there before them. After years of this infiltration, fueled in large part by BarackObama refugee program and the town of Dearborn becoming the Middle East of Michigan, citizens have had enough. The entitled ride of thinking they can take over has just come to an abrupt end with the rude awakening they just faced by one brave individual leading the charge of making the state American again. The nature of the Islamic religion does not allow Muslims to assimilate into Western culture ? they want to dominate it since everything America stands for is counter to their beliefs. Michigan has systematically been forced to bow down to Islam under the pressure of our previous president who herded thousands of refugees into their state and allowed one town, in particular, to become unrecognizable as an American city ? Dearborn ? which looks more like the Middle East with its predominately Muslim population of approximately 103,000, according to WXYZ. Muslims? plan is world domination asthat what their holy book preached for them to achieve. Key to that plan is the implementation of Sharia Law which they try to slowly establish under the radar here in America, without anyone realizing it beforeit too late. Wise to their disguise is Michigan Representative Michele Hoitenga whoisn taking a backseat to political correctness and just got proactive about stopping Muslims in their tracks with a nasty surprise she just slapped them with. With a new president in charge, states are starting to feel empowered to take assertive action against Islam in America, as was seen this week by what Hoitenga who just proposed a bill to ban Sharia Law. MLive reports: ?Michigan residents would be banned from using other countries? laws in court under a bill proposed by Rep. Michele Hoitenga, R-Manton, according to an email obtained by MLive. In an email sent to state lawmakers seeking co-sponsors on Monday, Hoitenga said her billdoesn specifically mention Sharia Law, but wrote that it would include the religious law association with Islam. ?If you have not heard by now, a doctor in Detroit is being charged with operating an underground clinic that actively engaged in genital mutilation on young girls, essentially practicing a fundamentalist version of Sharia Law,? Hoitenga wrote in the email.?Hoitega timingcouldn have been more important as she saw first-hand the horrific results of Islam and Sharia Law in her own state last week when a female doctor was arrested for what she had been doing to Michigan girls who were not Muslim. Federal prosecutors accused 44-year-old Muslim Dr. Jumana Nagarwala of performing female genital mutilation on unsuspecting little girls in her Detroit-area E.R. As expected, Hoitega faces an uphill battle with this bill in getting it past state Democrats who must not see a problem in disturbing crimes like Dr.Nagarwala who was forcing the sickest part of her religion on little girls. Hoitega wants to prevent more of this from being acceptable by law, whichshouldn be up for debate sinceit completely contradictory to the U.S. Constitution, which liberals love to ignore. Had this been a measure to prevent any other religion from gaining dominance over people, Democrats would be demanding that it pass and wreaking havoc on city streets if they were denied. We reported before that Michigan is under a siegeof Muslims as was captured by an undercover journalist with a video camera. A siege is currently taking place slowly and quietly, making a casualty of one city at a time. The first city to fall is Hamtramck, Michigan. But soon after it will be Dearborn. Michigan. And before we even know it, the whole nation will surrender our values, morals, and freedoms in the name of humanityand ?tolerance. Detroit Free Press Reports: Hamtramck residents have elected a Muslim majority to thecity six-member city council, symbolizing the demographic changes that have transformed the city once known for being a Polish Catholic enclave. InTuesday election ? with six candidates running for three seats ? the top three vote-getters were Muslim, while the bottom three were non-Muslim. Two of the Muslim candidates, Anam Miah and Abu Musa, are incumbent city councilmen, while newcomer Saad Almasmari, the top vote-getter, also was elected. The seat of another Muslim incumbent councilman, Mohammed Hassan, was not up for re-election, and incumbent City Councilman Robert Zwolak came in fifth place. Some believe the city is the first in the U.S. with a Muslim majority on its city council. Four of the six council members will be Muslim: three of them of Bangladeshi descent and one Yemeni. ?Hamtramck has made history,? said Hamtramck community leader Bill Meyer. ?The election was far from close, with the three Muslim winners each gaining over 1,000 votes, while the other three candidates garnered less than 700 votes each.? Councilman Musa, who came in second place, told the Free Press that he will work to represent everyone in the city regardless of background. ?I?m a very good Muslim,? said Musa, an immigrant from Bangladesh. ?I try my best to pray five times (a day), but when I get elected, every single ethnic votes for me, not (only) the Muslim vote for me, but Christians, every single ethnic group, African-Americans, Polish.I a good friend of the Polish.? ?I represent every single citizen in Hamtramck,? he said. ?I?m serving all city of Hamtramck.? Formerly known for its Polish population, Hamtramck is now about 24% Arab (mostly Yemeni); 19% African American; 15% Bangladeshi; 12% Polish; and 6% Yugoslavian (many Bosnian), according to U.S. Census figures. The percentage of residents who are Muslim is unclear since the U.S. Census does not ask about religion. Estimates of the Muslim population range from one-third to more than one-half of city residents. Almost all of the Yemeni Americans in Hamtramck are Muslim, while the growing Bangaldeshi-American community in Hamtramck has Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists. The city has a Bangladeshi Hindu temple and Bangladeshi mosques. On Friday, Gov. Rick Snyder attended the opening of Bangla Town, an area that will celebrate Bangladeshi-American culture in Hamtramck and bordering Detroit neighborhoods. About 41% of the city are immigrants, the highest percentage among cities in metro Detroit. Pope John Paul II, who was Polish, visited Hamtramck in 1987; a statue of him commemorating his visit is in a city park. Three of the Muslims onHamtramck City Council are of Bangladeshi descent, while Almasmari is of Yemeni descent. Thecouncil only other Arab-American Muslim in its history was Abdul Algazali, who died in February. The issue of Islam has sometimes come up in recent years as the Muslim population grows. After contentious debate, the city allowed in 2004 the Muslim call to prayer to be broadcast publicly five times a day from mosques through loudspeakers. The call to prayer has drawn complaints from residents who sayit loud and intrusive, waking them up early and bothering them. City Council candidate Susan Dunn, who came in fourth place, raised the issue during the campaign, prompting a response from Almasmari during a city council meeting last month. ?We all want to live peacefully and respectfully,? he said to the council during the October meeting, according to a video he posted to his Facebook account. ?Our special thing is ? the diversity in this town.? Almasmari said the call to prayer ?is not as loud as (Dunn) thinks.? Moreover, if ?we are considering the call to prayer as noise,? then so would ?the loud music all night long while we are sleeping.? ?We as Muslims respect our neighbors and wedon like to bother anybody,? he said. ?As the Prophet Mohammed said: he who believes in Allah and the last day, let him not harm his neighbors.? Meyer, who is not Muslim, said that Muslims in Hamtramck ?have helped bring stability, security and sobriety while lessening the amount of drugs and crime in the city.? h/t: [AmericanLookout]",0.027689031,0.007454739,0.01171459,0.008519701999999999,0.037273695,0.28860489899999997,0.056443024,2,-1,1
"Story highlights Stop-and-frisk is a type of aggressive policing It's unclear what the policy's impact was on New York City's crime rate Washington (CNN) Donald Trump was asked by a member of a Fox News town hall audience this week what he would do to reduce violent crime in the country's inner cities. ""Right, well, one of the things I'd do, Ricardo, is I would do 'stop-and-frisk.' I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically. You understand; you have to, in my opinion. I see what's going on here. I see what's going on in Chicago; I think stop-and-frisk, in New York City, it was so incredible, the way it worked."" Stop-and-frisk is a type of aggressive policing that allows -- some say encourages -- officers to detain a person on virtually any type of vague suspicion, search that individual without a warrant and arrest the person if any kind of illegal substance or weapon is found. It grew out of the tough policies of New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, now a vocal Trump supporter and trusted adviser, under the theory that aggressive enforcement of even minor laws would lead to a reduction of violent crime. Proponents of stop-and-frisk argue that it would be especially effective in getting illegal guns off the streets. Critics of the program questioned its constitutionality. They also pointed to the fact, documented in several studies, that the policy falls heaviest on black and Latino men.

"President Obama today vetoed a bill that would allow survivors of the 9/11 attacks, along with victims' families, to sue the government of Saudi Arabia. ?I am returning herewith without my approval S. 2040, the ?Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act? (JASTA), which would, among other things, remove sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated state sponsors of terrorism,? Obama notes in the veto message. ?I have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11), who have suffered grievously. I also have a deep appreciation of these families' desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts.? The veto comes at the end of a 10-day constitutional window after Congress' overwhelming approval of the legislation, setting up a fight that's likely to hand the outgoing president his first veto override. Suffering his first veto override so late in his second term would be significant, especially considering the president's high approval ratings relative to the rest of his presidency. By comparison, former President George W. Bush was overridden twice during his two terms in office and only in his final two years when his approval rating had plummeted. The last president to make it through a full presidency without a veto override is Lyndon B. Johnson. If passed into law, the legislation would allow victims of terrorism to sue foreign governments for damages. Obama and the White House have argued that language in the bill could potentially compromise the principle of ?sovereign immunity,? and put the U.S. government and entities at risk of being sued by other countries. ""Overriding the president's veto means that this country will start pursuing a less forceful approach in dealing with state sponsors of terrorism and potentially opens up U.S. service members and diplomats and even companies to spurious lawsuits in kangaroo courts around the world,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest explained to reporters today. ""Our concern extends not just to the impact this would have on our relationship with Saudi Arabia, but rather the impact that this could have on the United States' relationship with countries around the world."" But the showdown has also put the Obama administration at odds politically with the wishes of countless 9/11 families who argue they haven't had their day in court against all parties responsible for the terror attacks. Saudi Arabia has itself spoken critically of and personally lobbied against the effort, maintaining it had no role in assisting the 9/11 terrorists. The House and Senate each passed the measure by unanimous consent. A veto override requires a two-thirds vote by each chamber, and the White House says it has been working diligently behind the scenes to rally enough Democrats to block the override effort. Obama's former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, has also indicated she would sign the legislation into law if she wins the presidential election.",0.023054755,0.005763689000000001,0.005763689000000001,0.031700288,0.031700288,0.35446685899999997,0.020172911,2,-1,1
"It?s no secret that Russia is very pro-Donald Trump, and Donald Trump is extremely pro-Russia. His policies align withRussia Christmas list, and he hired ? for a campaign manager ? a man who benefited heavily from pro-Russian monies during the Ukrainian conflict. In fact, the ties between Paul Manafort and Russian oligarchs became so widely known that it caused his premature departure from the campaign, prompting many questions to be raised. The Trump campaign thought this would all be behind them in no time. But, as usual, they were wrong. On Friday, it was a announced that U.S. intelligence officials are investigating Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser to Trump, for alleged ties to Russia. Intelligence officials have reason to believe that Page has opened up secret and backroom communications with top Russian officials in an ongoing effort to have economic sanctions lifted. According to Yahoo News, which first broke the story: The activities of Trump adviser Carter Page, who has extensive business interests in Russia, have been discussed with senior members of Congress during recent briefings about suspected efforts by Moscow to influence the presidential election, the sources said. After one of those briefings, Senate minority leader Harry Reid wrote FBI Director James Comey, citing reports of meetings between a Trump adviser (a reference to Page) and ?high ranking sanctioned individuals? in Moscow over the summer as evidence of ?significant and disturbing ties? between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin that needed to be investigated by the bureau. The reports apparently had some members of Congress ?taken aback,? due to the overwhelming and disturbing evidence that shows these ties. Congressional members, which includes California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, fear that such ties could lead to an unfair tampering with not only U.S.-Russian relations, but undercut foreign policy and even the November presidential election. Page is a former banker who worked for Merrill Lynch and is based in Moscow, giving him strong ties with rich and influential Russian officials. In fact, one ofPage business buddies is especially problematic for American diplomacy and international law: But U.S. officials have since received intelligence reports that during that same three-day trip, Page met with Igor Sechin, a longtime Putin associate and former Russian deputy prime minister who is now the executive chairman of Rosneft,Russian leading oil company, a well-placed Western intelligence source tells Yahoo News. That meeting, if confirmed, is viewed as especially problematic by U.S. officials because the Treasury Department in August 2014 named Sechin to a list of Russian officials and businessmen sanctioned overRussia ?illegitimate and unlawful actions in the Ukraine. So now that that the Trump campaign is once again under the microscope for shady Russian ties, they did what they know best: they lied. Page has been listed as a foreign policy adviser to Trump since March. In August, Hope Hicks, spokeswoman for the campaign, confirmed that Carter was an adviser. Now? Communications director Jason Miller told The Hill that Page is ?not an adviser and has made no contribution to the campaign.? So which is it? The campaign and its spokeswoman have confirmed that Page is in fact an adviser, and now their communications director sayshe not nor has he ever been.It becoming clearer and clearer everyday that the Trump campaign is nothing more than a puppet of the Kremlin andPutin rich, thuggish buddies. But no,let continue to talk about HillaryClinton pneumonia, becausethat way more important than a potentially stolen election by the same people supporting one of the candidates.

"?There?s no question that the activities that take place in this country and in countries around the world have some impact on the environment and some impact on climate,? Mike Pence says. | Getty Pence: ?No question? humans impact climate Soon after DonaldTrump campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said the GOP nominee believes ?global warming is naturally occurring,? Mike Pence declared ?there?s no question? human activities impact the climate. ?There?s no question that the activities that take place in this country and in countries around the world have some impact on the environment and some impact on climate,? Pence,Trump running mate, said Tuesday on CNN. Story Continued Below The confusion came on the heels ofMonday presidential debate, in which Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton pointed out that Trump previously said climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. ?The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive,? Trump wrote on Twitter in 2012. Trump later said it was a joke. On Tuesday, Pence told CNN it was ?a humorous tweet? and sought to turn the argument on the Democrats. ?What Donald Trump said was a hoax is that bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., can control the climate of the earth,? Pence said. ?And the reality is that this climate change agenda that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton want to continue to expand is killing jobs in this country.? Pence has repeatedly pledged that he and Trump will end the so-called ?war on coal,? a reference to Obama administration policies that have led to the closures of a number of coal-fired power plants.

"None of the major networks has publicly committed to doing concurrent on-screen fact-checking during the debate. | AP Photo Networks reject on-screen fact checking during debate Despite Clinton's demand that Trump be held accountable, outlets say they aren't prepared to weigh in while candidates speak. To fact check or not ? that was the debate before the debate, one that pitted HillaryClinton backers against Donald Trump supporters and even engaged some top journalists. But as the hour of the debate drew closer, only the comparatively small Bloomberg TV network publicly said it would be doing any sort of on-screen fact checks during the debate, running them periodically as part of their headline scroll. Story Continued Below Despite the demands from the Clinton campaign for more media fact checks in the wake of MattLauer failure to correctTrump assertions atNBC commander-in-chief forum, none of the major networks has publicly committed to doing concurrent on-screen fact-checking during the debate, when the audience is highest. That would leave the moderator, NBC News anchor Lester Holt, on his own in deciding whether to weigh in on the candidates? claims ? as both sides tried to publicly pressure him in the hours leading up to the debate. Democrats including vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine called fact-checking crucial to the debate, while Republicans echoedTrump demand that Holt refrain from intervening the way that Candy Crowley did in the second 2012 debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, when she sought to correct Romney on his claim that Obamahadn characterized the Benghazi attacks as terrorism. While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics. Of the networks POLITICO surveyed, only Bloomberg TV confirmed that it will be doing on-screen fact checking during the debate. Network spokespeople said the on-screen fact checks would need to be nearly instantaneous to correlate with the answer the candidate is giving, leading to some high editorial and technical hurdles. Only NBC,Holt home network, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage. Debate moderators and questioners have been more frequent targets than usual during this election cycle, with the Republican National Committee even going so far as to pull planned debates with NBC-related networks because itdidn like how CNBC handled an early primary-election debate. The journalists moderating the debates and providing questions have been singled out by critics in both parties for offenses ranging from asking too many gotchaquestions to tossing too many softballs. Some moderators were criticized for losing control of the debates, while others were knocked for being too controlling themselves. Lauer, who sat in silence while Trump insisted he never supported the Iraq war ? despite well-known footage of him saying the opposite ? was only the most recent big-name anchor to emerge from a highly touted campaign forum with his reputation challenged. And both the Trump and Clinton camps have made it clear thatthey be scrutinizing Holt very closely. ""These are two of the most difficult people in American politics to interview for very different reasons,? said veteran CBS News anchor and debate moderator Bob Schieffer. ""So I think a moderators [of the three scheduled debates] are going to have their hands full. But I think all of them are veteran journalists and they will have done their homework by the time they get to the debate andthey do fine."" For 90 minutes, with no break, Holt will lob questions of his own choosing at the candidates, guiding how and when they will respond. Schieffer, who said he has not given advice to Holt but has to some of the other moderators, said the hardest part for a moderator is not the vaunted ?fact checking? that Lauer was so criticized for not enacting, but rather keeping track of the time and making sure the candidates get to the point. ?[Moderators] are always part of the story,? Schieffer said. ""Whenthere someone to blame for something, people first turn to the press. That seems to be our role traditionally, thatit our fault. Youcan help but become part of the story. You need to remember that going in. This scrutiny now is so intense, if youhadn been through it before you better get used to it now.? Despite the evident pressure, handling the first debate will be a huge opportunity for Holt, who took over ?Nightly News? from Brian Williams under less than ideal circumstances. Instead of a grandly orchestrated rollout, Holt took over the anchor desk with little fanfare, as all of the drama focused on Williams? fabrications and ultimate suspension. (Williams is now back on air, anchoring for MSNBC.) Holt has stayed away from doing any publicity ahead of the debates and stopped anchoring ?Nightly News? last Tuesday to prepare for Mondaynight faceoff. Schieffer said moderators do best when they deliver short and simple questions that force the candidates to explain themselves. ""A key question for both these candidates is 'how are you going to do that?? ? Schieffer said. ?? How are you going to get the money to do it and how are you going to put together the coalition you would need ifit a law to get something like that passed?"" The Clinton campaignhasn been directly in touch with Holt about its expectations for his handling of fact-checking duties on Trump ? whom Clinton allies say routinely sprinkles his interviews and debate performances with assertions that journalists knowaren true but are reluctant to challenge. But the campaign has made little secret of its insistence that Holt hold Trump accountable. ""For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage,? Clinton Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri said during a conference call with reporters on Friday. ""We do believe it is the role of the moderator . . . to call out those lies and to do that in real time."" But the two former presidential debate moderators, Scheiffer and Lehrer, saidthat not necessarily how they would do it. Becoming the fact checker risks putting oneself in the position of Crowley, whom many Republicans believe damagedRomney performance unfairly. ""My thought is yes the moderators have to fact-check, but the first fact-check opporutnity should go to the candidate themselves,? Scheiffer said. ?If candidate A said something and is blatantly wrong you want to give candidate B the first opportunity to fact check that."" If the second candidatedoesn step in, Scheiffer said, the moderator has ?the responsibility? to ?state for the record what the facts are.? Jim Lehrer, the former PBS Newshour anchor who has moderated 12 presidential debates, said he also would strongly prefer to have the candidates fact-check each other than to step in himself. ""Usually the way you do that with simply the candidate there, you say 'would you agree with that, is that how you see it?? ? Lehrer said. ?In debates I tried to not do that [fact check] because Ididn want to get in the way."" Both Schieffer and Lehrer saidit almost guaranteed that Holt will be criticized by one side or the other, if not both. When Lehrer stayed mostly out of Obama andRomney way during the first presidential debate in 2012, he was criticized for not taking enough control. That same year, Schieffer was criticized for allowing the final debate to stray from foreign policy, the chosen topic for that debate. ?This will be the ultimate Rashomontest,? Lehrer said, referring to the famous movie in which an event is viewed differently by each character. ?They always are, this one will just be a little more extreme.""

"John G. Stumpf left senators dissatisfied with comments that he would have no responsibility in clawing back top officials' pay. Warren tells Wells Fargo's CEO to resign, calls for investigation Sen. Elizabeth Warren told Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO John Stumpf at a public hearing Tuesday he should resign in the wake of an unauthorized customer-account scandal, return the money he made while the activity went on, and face a Justice Department investigation for possible criminality. ""It's gutless leadership,"" Warren said of Stumpf's response to revelations that the bank opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' permission. Story Continued Below The Massachusetts Democrat used the closely watched Senate Banking Committee hearing to make her case that the United States needs ""tough new laws"" to hold corporate executives personally accountable. Stumpf left senators dissatisfied with comments that he would have no responsibility in clawing back top officials' pay. He deferred to the rest of the bank's board when it came to questions about decisions involving compensation for executives. ""That's unfortunate,"" said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the panel's top-ranking Democrat. Senators have urged Stumpf to revoke money from retiring consumer banking head Carrie Tolstedt, who is reportedly leaving the company with $125 million in stocks and options. Stumpf said he was not involved with compensation discussions at the board level. Though he is the board chairman, he does not sit on the Human Resources Committee responsible for overseeing executive pay. ""To not invoke some degree of clawback for yourself and others involved would be committing malpractice from the standpoint of just public relations,"" Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said. Senators from both parties suggested that Wells Fargo might have violated SEC rules. Warren said the agency should also investigate Stumpf. Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican running for reelection in Pennsylvania, told Stumpf that he had been unable to find Wells Fargo disclosing potential material risks to investors related to the scandal. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said the SEC should investigate whether Wells Fargo violated internal control provisions in the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act by not recognizing and stopping widespread fraud. In an attempt to illustrate what she said was Stumpf's personal gain from the unauthorized account openings, Warren said Wells Fargo shares held by Stumpf during the period of the scam grew in value by more than $200 million. ""If one of your tellers took a handful of $20 bills out of the cash drawerthey probably be looking at criminal charges for theft,"" she said. ""They could end up in prison. But you squeezed your employees to the breaking point so they would cheat customers and you could drive up the value of your stock and put hundreds of millions of dollars in your own pocket."" Stumpf, responding to criticism from Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), said,""If I could turn the clock back, andI thought about this a thousand times, of course we all wish we would have done something more earlier.

"Donald Trump has again made a huge mistake while referring to life experienced by many black Americans every day. The screw-up in question came as Trump seriously argued that the lives of blacks today are worse than they were during slavery and in the Jim Crow segregation era. Speaking at a rally in Kenansville, North Carolina, Trump again stumbled in an apparent attempt to endear himself to black voters. ?We?re going to make our country safe again.We going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape thatthey ever been in before,? he said. ?Ever, ever, ever.? The comment, made in a city named for a slave owner, is objectively untrue, and completely ignores that black people were once subjected to slavery and Jim Crow laws. While the media has largely viewedTrump weird racial comments as a sign that he is ?reaching out? to black voters, polls have actually shown that he is poised to do worse with that group than Mitt Romney or John McCain. Black voters have had an inherent distrust of Trump, which has been amplified thanks to his promotion of the racist birtherconspiracy there for years.Trump also called for the death penalty for the Central Park 5, long after it had been proven that the young black men involved with the case had been proven innocent. Lately, Trump has argued that the black community in America is a desperate, infantile mess, relying on government welfare in order to simply get by. The image Trump has been spreading has not been for black audiences, but instead have been targeted to a conservative base, high on the idea that ethnic minorities always have their hands out. Black voters have foundTrump description of them insulting, particularly coming as the community has made huge strides forward.

"Donald Trump supporters are so desperate to be in power that they are threatening America at gunpoint to vote for him or be killed.That what Georgia Trump fan Jimmy Arno is preparing for after the election votes are tallied in November because he expects a bloody civil war to break out in order to overthrow the government before Hillary Clinton is inaugurated. Arno is even considering joining a right-wing militia, whom he collectively refers to as ?patriots,? because he seriously believes only they can defend the Constitution. ?Should martial law, civil war ? whatever ? break out in this country, they will uphold the Constitution and rebuild our loss,? he said. ?The warthat going to break out if HillaryClinton elected, if that happens. Your patriots are going to overthrow the government.? And of course, Arno is a fan of the Confederacy, loves the Confederate flag, and has a portrait of Robert E. Lee hanging in his living room. So basically, what Arno is saying is that he believes the South will rise again and a civil war sequel will turn out differently. This time a rebellion will somehow succeed even though the United States military, including a navy and air force, would be standing in their way. Nevertheless, threats of civil war and violent rebellion are frightening but they also prove that conservatives are unfit to govern because apparently the only way they can do so is with a gun pressed against the heads of the people. Arno went on to blame President Obama directly for the high racial tensions. ?I know that we were a whole lot further along racially eight years ago than we are today,? he claims. But the fact is that Republicans raised those racial tensions themselves by vowing to make President Obama fail from the start simply because of the color of his skin and their claim that he is an illegitimate president. The birther movement, of which Trump is a prominent leader, contends that President Obama is not one of us and that hewasn born here. The election of President Obama made racists, including Arno, mad so they started publicly throwing a hissy fit and their tantrums have only gotten worse in the last eight years.Here the audio via NPR. Trump supporters are deplorable people who want to shoot and kill anyone who disagrees with them just so they can watch the world burn. If Hillary Clinton is elected president as she should be, conservatives need to accept that they lost instead of resorting to taking up arms against the country. Such an action is treason and would only demonstrate that they are nothing more than sore losers who should never be allowed to get close to political power ever again.

"Donald Trump has unleashed an unprecedented deluge of small-dollar donations for the GOP, one that Republican Party elders have dreamed about finding for much of the past decade asthey watched a succession of Democrats ? Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders and, to a lesser extent, Hillary Clinton ? develop formidable fundraising operations $5, $10 and $20 at a time. Trump has been actively soliciting cash for only a few months, but when he reveals hiscampaign financials later this week they will show he has crushed the total haul from small-dollar donors to the past two Republican nominees, John McCain and Mitt Romney ? during the entirety of their campaigns. Story Continued Below All told, Trump is approaching, or may have already passed, $100 million from donors who have given $200 or less, according to an analysis of available Federal Election Commission filings, thecampaign public statements and people familiar with his fundraising operation. It is a threshold no other Republican has ever achieved in a single campaign. And Trump has done so less than three months after signing his first email solicitation for donors on June 21 ? a staggering speed to collect such a vast sum. ?I?ve never seen anything like this,? said a senior Republican operative who has worked closely with thecampaign small-dollar fundraising operation. ?He?s the Republican Obama in terms of online fundraising.? Clinton counted 2.3 million donors as of the end of August, the result of decades of campaigning, a previous presidential bid and allies who painstakingly built her an email file of supporters even before she formally announced her second run. But Trump had zoomed to 2.1 million donors in the past three months alone, his campaign has said. The question now is what the gusher means for the GOP. The Republican National Committee, through a deal struck with Trump in May, is getting 20 percent of the proceeds from its small-donor operation for Trump plus access to this invaluable new donor and email file. But canTrump candidacy help close the RepublicanParty small-donor divide in one fell swoop? Will these donors ? 2.1 million and counting ? give to other Republicans? Will they drag the Republican Party inTrump direction for years to come? Or, if he loses, will they simply vanish? ?The challenge is that we still have a divided party,? said Mindy Finn, who ledRomney digital team in 2008 and worked for George W.Bush reelection in 2004. Trump has found record-setting success as the first Republican nominee ?in the Internet age? to have made empowering the grass roots and railing against the elite a core of his campaign message, Finn said. Going forward, the key will be whether his donors can be convinced to give to a candidate with just a bit less bombast. ?Can you be a populist without being a barnburner?? she asked. ?And thus still be able to raise this kind of money?? Or, as a second operative who has worked withTrump small-dollar fundraising operation, put it, ?Idon know how much these Trump donors ? if hedoesn win ? want to give to the RNC.? Trump, a self-proclaimed billionaire who bragged during the primaries about how hedidn need anyoneelse cash to run for president, would appear at first to be the unlikeliest of Republican fundraising heroes. But the combination of his celebrity, anti-establishment populism, and running against Clinton has led to a windfall, even as his skeletal campaign did little for more than a year to cultivate a donor list or build digital infrastructure to lure contributors. ?People are pouring in, andwe having to manage the inflow,? said one of the operatives familiar with the Trump operation. It is impossible to piece together a complete picture ofTrump finances due to different reporting deadlines forTrump various committees. But as of the end of July, he had amassed $50 million in small contributions into his campaign, FEC records show. He has since announced he raised $90 million in August mostlyfrom small donors both directly for his campaign and in joint committees shared with the Republican National Committee ? suggesting at least $45 million raised last month came from small contributors. Additionally, there is some money from small contributors in those shared RNC accounts ? Trump said they contained $37 million at the end of July ? that he has helped raise.Trump success dwarfs those of his GOP predecessors. McCain and Romney, in 2008 and 2012, respectively, raised just less than $64 million in contributions of $200 or less, according to FEC records (McCain, notably, accepted public funds in the 2008 general election). Trump still lags far behind the pace-setting Democrats. President Obama raised an enormous $483.6 million in contributions of $200 or less in 2012, FEC records show. Sanders raised almost $202 million in small donations just during the 2016 primary. And Clinton raised almost $156 million in such contributions through the end of July, according to the FEC. Democrats seem to vacillate between comforting themselves with all that Trump continues to do wrong ? botching MikePence announcement, the high spam rate on their first email, the volume of ads targeting Democrats ? and concern about his successes in spite of that. ?I would just put it in the perspective ofthey still not doing as well as they should be doing, andthey doing too little too late,? said Kenneth Pennington, who served as digital director for Sanders. ?Once they start copying some of the things Democrats are doing, thenI get worried.? Trump is certainly spending big to raise small money. In July, he poured $8.4 million into his San Antonio-based digital firm, Giles-Parscale, most of which was spent on online advertising and prospecting for donors. People familiar with the Trump operation say that the campaign has essentially told digital vendors that it will run as many Facebook and Google ads as possible, so long as investing in the particular ad is generating positive cash flow, or return on investment. ?We?ve had a positive ROI on everything,? said one Trump campaign official. Brad Parscale, who runs the Trump digital operation and began working for the Trump family before it entered politics, has increasingly begun traveling to New York and accumulating power within the campaign. Last week, Donald Trump Jr. visitedParscale operation in San Antonio to thank the employees, and RNC officials, dispatched there. ?Every timethere been a change in leadership,he gotten significantly more authority,? an operative who has worked with the campaign said of Parscale. Of course, the ever-increasing flow of money to Trump Tower has certainly helped. On Aug. 31, the day Trump went to Mexico and the last day of the reporting period that will be revealed this week, Trump raised an enormous $5 million. The campaign ran a dizzying 107,000 different ad combinations on Facebook on that day alone, according to Lindsay Walters, a Republican National Committee spokeswoman, swapping out different text, graphics and videos to determine what performed strongest. A typical day involves 40,000 to 50,000 such combinations, Walters said. Another person familiar with the Trump and RNC digital operation said there has been some strain simply creating content fast enough to fill all the ad slots that are making them money. In an atypical arrangement for a presidential campaign, the RNC is actually taking a cut of all the small-dollar fundraising done through its joint committee with Trump (Romney received 100 percent of the jointcommittee small donations, in contrast). The agreement was struck back in May, when Trump emerged as the nominee with little infrastructure or experience to execute a large-scale digital operation. As a result, the RNC will end 2016 will access to a far larger email and donor file than ever before. ?A lot of them probablydon realize that 20 percent of the money goes to the RNC; otherwise they probablywouldn give,? said one of the operatives who has worked with Trump and the RNC. ?People are giving money to the joint fundraising committee because DonaldTrump name is on it.? Indeed, almost all of the ads prominently incorporateTrump image or name ? offering dinner with Trump, coffee with Ivanka Trump, lunch with Eric Trump. And the appealsaren just for petty cash. Trump has run an extensive email campaign asking for $184 for signed copies of ?The Art of the Deal? ? an unusually large sum to seek online. ?Wewouldn be running all that stuff if itwasn working,? said a person who has worked with the campaign. In a sign of the potency ofTrump name, others are trying to capitalize as well. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign arm of Senate Republicans, has been blitzing its own email list with Trump-themed missives. So far in September, the NRSC has offered Trump-Pence yard signs, bumper stickers, bracelets, magnets and T-shirts, even as strategists have urged Senate candidates themselves to distance themselves from Trump on the trail. Other, insurgent-style Republicans have found success among small donors in the past. BenCarson primary campaign floundered but he still raised $48 million among those who gave $200 or less. Ted Cruz raised more than $60 million from such givers before he dropped out.

"JUST IN: ISIS Hits U.S. Troops With CHEMICAL Weapons? The use of chemical weapons is banned throughout most civilized countries. However, the savages that comprise ISIS have certainly never been accused of being civilized? Early reports indicate that ISIS has used chemical weapons on U.S. troops in Iraq. Several U.S. officials have claimed that ISIS fired a shell filled with Mustard Gas into Qayyara Air Base in Iraq on Tuesday where U.S. and Iraqi troops are stationed. The shell was either a rocket or an artillery shell and was promptly tested and revealed to contain a chemical agent that reports indicate was Mustard Gas. No troops were injured in the attack and no troops have yet showed any signs or symptoms of the effects of Mustard Gas. ? 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

U.S. officials have anticipated an attack of this nature as several hundred U.S. troops remain stationed just outside of Mosul to assist Iraqi forces in taking-back Mosul from ISIS. Pentagon officials have maintained that U.S. airstrikes have been hitting locations where it is believed that ISIS is manufacturing chemicals like Mustard Gas. However, Mustard Gas is fairly easy to produce and while our airstrikes have been effective, it is unlikely that our efforts will cease production of such weapons. While President Obama and his band of weakling followers cannot be blamed for each vile act conducted by ISIS, they can be blamed for not taking seriously enough the resolve of the terrorist groups fighting to the death to kill so-called infidels. Though President Obama seems pleased with his oh-so-gentle brand of targeted airstrikes, our military engagement in the Middle East does little but inconvenience ISIS as they march onward towards more death and destruction.

"The San Francisco 49ers are now facing fallout from their decision not to cut backup quarterback Colin Kaepernick. The Santa Clara police union has reportedly threatened to boycott 49ers games in response to quarterback Colin Kaepernick's refusal to stand during the national anthem and his comments on racial injustice and police brutality. Members of the union wrote a letter to the San Francisco 49ers, which was obtained by KNTV, warning that if the team does not take action against Kaepernick, ""it could result in police officers choosing not to work at your facilities."" The Santa Clara Police Department is the primary law enforcement agency at Levi's Stadium, where the 49ers play. About 70 officers choose work during games and are paid as security personnel. The union says about two-thirds of the officers who work at Levi's Stadium are from Santa Clara. Officers from other departments could be hired if Santa Clara officers decide not to show up, but Saunders says this could create a conflict with the city's contract with the union.

"Story highlights Barack Obama in 2008 got one electoral vote from deep red Nebraska The candidates have taken note of the possibility to edge closer to 270 Washington (CNN) Presidential elections are a state-by-state battle. But in two instances this November, it could be district by district. Maine and Nebraska are the only two states in the nation that don't have a winner-take-all system for their Electoral College votes. That means that even if a candidate doesn't win the statewide popular vote in those states, they could pick up one or two Electoral College votes if they win in congressional districts. And with an increasingly close election, both Republicans and Democrats see an opportunity to add purple to the map. Brief civics lesson: You're not technically voting for president on Nov. 8; you're voting for electors. It's those people -- 538 of them -- who technically pick the president. There's a math equation used to calculate how many electors each state gets: three Electoral College votes based on the total number of US senators and US representatives it has (and three extras for the District of Columbia). While individual electors may technically cast those votes for whomever they choose, it is virtually unheard of for a candidate who wins the popular vote in a state to not get all the electoral votes, and many states have laws enforcing that electors must respect the statewide vote.

"In a shocking, sudden turn of events, one of thecountry most controversial cases that went to court over a year ago has just ended with all charges dropped against this person. Three others involved in this massive news piece have also been exonerated. While there will be much excitement over this stunning decision, there are likely to be riots as well from the opposition. Was justice effective served? It depends on where you stand on the issue of what this crimewas. Barack Hussein Obama was thispatriot biggest nemesis whose orders led to a deadly standoff. With a new president in charge, things have changed dramatically on one of thecountry biggest cases that would have gone much differently had President Donald Trump not been in office. Fox News reports: A federal judge dismissed all charged against rancher Cliven Bundy and three others U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro cited ?flagrant prosecutorial misconduct? in her decision to dismiss all charges against rancher Cliven Bundy, two of his sons and another person. This comes after a standoff two years ago that ended in a court battle that began in October of 2017. Fox explains the unprecedented move made today that was not expected: The embarrassment a federal judge dealt to government prosecutors last month in the Cliven Bundy case could be set to resume Monday, at a hearing to determine whether the cattle rancher who became a folk hero long before he beat the feds can be retried. U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro on Dec. 20 declared a mistrial in the high-profile case. It was only the latest, stunning development in the saga of the Nevada rancher, and served as a repudiation of the federal government. Navarro accused prosecutors of willfully withholding evidence fromBundy lawyers, in violation of the federal Brady rule. The Brady rule, named after the landmark 1963 Supreme Court case known as Brady v. Maryland, holds that failure to disclose such evidence violates adefendant right to due process. ?In this case the failures to comply with Brady were exquisite, extraordinary,? said Fox News legal analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano. ?The judge exercised tremendous patience.? The 71-year-oldBundy battle with the federal government eventually led to what became known as the Bundy standoff of 2014. But it began long before that. In the early 1990s, the U.S. government limited grazing rights on federal lands in order to protect the desert tortoise habitat. In 1993, Bundy, in protest, refused to renew his permit for cattle grazing, and continued grazing his livestock on these public lands. Hedidn recognize the authority of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) over the sovereign state of Nevada. The federal courts sided with the BLM, and Bundydidn seem to have a legal leg to stand on. Nevertheless, the rancher and the government continued this dispute for 20 years, and Bundy ended up owing over $1 million in fees and fines. Things came to a head in 2014, when officials planned to capture and impound cattle trespassing on government land. Protesters, many armed, tried to block the authorities, which led to a standoff. For a time, they even shut down a portion of I-15, the main interstate highway running through Southern Nevada. Tensions escalated until officials, fearing for the general safety, announced they would returnBundy cattle and suspend the roundup. Afterward, Bundy continued to graze his cattle and not pay fees. He and his fellow protesters were heroes to some, but criminals to the federal government. Bundy, along with others seen as leaders of the standoff, including sons Ammon and Ryan, were charged with numerous felonies, including conspiracy, assault on a federal officer and using a firearm in a violent crime. They faced many years in prison. The Bundy case finally began in late October, 2017. But just two months later, it ended with Navarro angry, the feds humiliated and Bundy ? at least to his supporters ? vindicated. In fact, Navarro had suspended the trial earlier and warned of a mistrial when prosecutors released information after a discovery deadline. Overall, the government was late in handing over more than 3,300 pages of documents. Further, some defense requests for information that ultimately came to light had been ridiculed by prosecutors as fantasticaland a ?fishing expedition.? ?Either the government lied or [it?s actions were] so grossly negligent as to be tantamount to lying,? Napolitano said. ?This happened over and over again.? Navarro offered a handful of examples of theprosecution failure to disclose. One had to do with a video showing government surveillance of the Bundy ranch, as well as government snipers, before the standoff. ?Timing is everything when it comes to these documents,? said Napolitano. ?The tapes show that the defendants were telling the truth when they said they brought a militia to the property to protect them from snipers, rather than thegovernment version, which is that the snipers came to protect the government agents from the militia.? Other instances of the government holding back included the failure to produce an internal affairs report on BLM misconduct, which the defense requested and the government denied existed, and threat assessments by federal agents declaring the Bundys were not likely to use violence. ?The court does regrettably believe a mistrial in this case is the most suitable and only remedy,? Navarro said in declaring a mistrial. Ammon and Ryan Bundy were arrested. LaVoy Finicum was dead. The standoff in Oregon between ranchers and the federal government seemed to be at an end as the leaders of the revolt had either been killed, or were in custody. Four holdouts remained at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in eastern Oregon, though. Negotiations were underway for their surrender. The son of famed preacher Billy Graham, Franklin Graham, said he would meet with the four holdouts at the national refuge, presumably to bring the revolt which has captivated Americans nationwide to a peaceful resolution. Elected officials joined in the fray, telling the holdouts to ?stay alive? so their story could be told. While this was happening, Cliven Bundy announced he would come to Oregon to bolster the holdouts stand against the federal government. As the holdouts somehow managed to break an FBI blockof internet and cell communications, and stream audio, and video of what was happening, Cliven Bundy landed at Portland International Airport, and was immediately surrounded by SWAT teams. USA Today reports that the elderly rancher was arrested, and booked into Multnomah County Jail. Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy has been arrested after flying into Portland International Airport. The father of Ammon Bundy, the leader of the occupation at an Oregon wildlife refuge, was detained by the FBI and booked into Multnomah County Jail on Wednesday night, theprison records show. A post on BundyRanch Facebook page said: ?Cliven Bundy just landed in Portland; we are being told by eyes on ground that he was surrounded by SWAT and DETAINED.? The 74-year-old, who intended to travel to Burns, close to the wildlife refuge, faces federal charges related to a standoff at his ranch in 2014, The Oregonian reported. The newspaper said he faces a charge of conspiracy to interfere with a federal officer and weapons charges. The elderly Bundy was good friends with Arizona rancher LaVoy Finicum, who was killed by authorities during the Oregon standoff. During the standoff, Finicum told reporters that he just wanted to go home. Finicum was a foster parent to 4, and hosted 50 foster children at his ranch in Arizona. Finicum explained in a video why he disliked the federal government so much. The Bureau of Land Management stole his water. The ?Oregon Standoff? began because Amanda Marshall, an Obama appointee for U.S. attorney for Oregon, recommended that the government sentence Oregon rancher Dwight Hammond and his son, Steven Hammond as terrorists for a controlled burn on their land which reached federal land.

" The archconservative Arizona Republic newspaper in Phoenix has endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, less than 24 hours after the conclusion of the first presidential debate. If there were questions this summer that Arizona has become a swing state, this surprising answer puts a must win state for Republicans ? which has been solidly red since becoming a state ? into play for Democrats in 2016.Arizona largest media outlet has never picked a Democrat for President since 1890. Not only did the Republic endorse Clinton because Trump is unfit for office, but their 1400 word endorsement is lengthy, absolutely comprehensive, filled with videos and even rejects the Republican embrace of racist immigration politics for the DemocraticParty inclusive recipes to move America forward: The Arizona Republic endorses Hillary Clinton for president. America needs to look ahead and build a new era of prosperity for the working class. This is HillaryClinton opportunity. She can reach out to those who feel left behind. She can make it clear that America sees them and will address their concerns. She can move us beyond rancor and incivility. As secretary of state, Clinton made gender equality a priority for U.S. foreign policy. This is an extension ofClinton bold ?women?s rights are human rights? speech in 1995. It reflects an understanding thatAmerica commitment to human rights is a critically needed beacon intoday troubled world. Clinton retains her composure under pressure.She tough. Shedoesn back down. Trump responds to criticism with the petulance of verbal spit wads.That beneath our national dignity. When the president of the United States speaks, the world expects substance. Not a blistering tweet. In fact, the Arizona Republic published such a lengthy editorial board statement thatit easier to summarize their section headers, because these eight points made by the conservative newspaper answer many of themedia lingering questions about both candidates.

If a candidatecan control his wordsClinton opportunity to heal this nation The Republic reserved its harshest criticism forTrump misadventure to Mexico City, then paired with an immigration speech in Phoenix. TheRepublican gamble failed, and the trip to our southern neighbor mushroomed into an international incident, spurring legislation which will prevent Mexico from ever paying for a border wall. Even worse for Trump, the ArizonaRepublic unequivocal slam dunk of his mindless harsh immigration policies is a massive failure in the border state whose notorious Sheriff Joe Arpaio is the most racist lawman in America. Phoenix has voted the racist birther ? who refuses to give up the witch hunt of President Obama like Trump claimed he would ? into office since 1993, andit a place who prefers the most extreme solutions to immigration and loves racial profiling in law enforcement. The Republic roundly condemned Republican tropes demonizing Latinos in general and Mexicans in particular:There just a certain segment of American voters who will never ever change their minds based on facts, and sothey continue to vote Trump. But independent and undecided voters can trust the numerous factual reasons issued from sources like the Arizona Republic, who have no incentive to be nice to Hillary Clinton or institutional preference for Democrats. If Hillary Clinton can win over so many Republicans with her leadership qualities and competent preparation for the job of President, the choice to vote for the Democratic nominee forAmerica independent voters should be clear this November.

""Again, I think you're going to have to ask her that question. That's a matter of policy, and I'm going to leave it for her to determine that,"" Mook said.

""I think ? look, you're asking new policy questions. You would have to ask the secretary for that,"" Mook said. ""My job's not to set policy."" ""New?"" Scarborough responded incredulously. ""Aleppo's been around for ? Syria's been around for some time. The red line being drawn has been around for some time. I'm not being difficult here at all. These are basic questions."" ""And I'm not being difficult either. I'm simply saying that she has laid out a plan to defeat ISIS, and if there are new questions pertaining to Aleppo, I'm going to need to let her answer those, and she will answer those in the debate, and we look forward to her having the opportunity to do that,"" Mook said. ""And as I said, Donald Trump has been able ? unable, rather, to release a plan, and we hope that he will reveal what his plans are in the debate."" As the interview drew to a close, Geist asked Mook about Clinton's current thinking on no-fly zones in Syria, given her past support. ""I'm going to let her statements speak for themselves,"" Mook said, smiling and laughing. Geist followed up, ""Robby, aren't you here representing her point of view?"" ""I am, indeed, and I'm gonna let her language speak for itself,"" Mook said, to which Geist responded that the Clinton aide was saying that Trump would not clarify his policy at the same time he would not address questions about his own candidate's. ""You are quoting Secretary Clinton's plans as she's laid them out. I'm going to let them speak for themselves,"" Mook repeated. ""Donald Trump has not laid out a single plan."" Moments after concluding the interview, Scarborough remarked to the panel, ""So what's going on? I don't understand that. I'm completely flummoxed by that interview."" ""I mean, first of all, are they pleased, and openness with the press,"" he said, referring to Mook's comments earlier in the same interview to that effect. ""I heard after the pneumonia deal they all were chastened and changing their relationship and trying to be more open with the press. Won't respond into Aleppo. Won't respond to the no-fly zone. What's going on here? Better not to come on."" Brad Woodhouse, president of the pro-Clinton super PAC Correct the Record, ripped into the show for its line of questioning. Woodhouse retweeted the Los Angeles Times' Mike Memoli, who asked, ""How much time does @Morning_Joe crew think a campaign manager is spending on Syria policy 50 days out?"" ""No s---. That was ridiculous and uncalled for.

Kathy Miller -- who is white -- resigned from her position, which the Trump campaign said was a volunteer job, and apologized for the ""inappropriate remarks,"" according to a statement from the Trump campaign.

A surrogate for the New York businessman's campaign said Trump was not suggesting that African-Americans are worse off now than under Jim Crow segregation. ""I don't think he's talking about the days of Jim Crow, even the days of the civil rights movement of the '60s and obviously not slavery.

The poll from Elon University found Trump leading Clinton by 1 point among likely voters, 44% to 43%, a statistical tie, within the 3.86-point margin of error. Libertarian Gary Johnson drew 6% support, while another 6% said they were undecided. Clinton and Trump maintain large advantages in North Carolina with key constituencies -- Clinton receives the support of 98% of black voters, while Trump is backed by 65% of white voters. The gender divide is less severe, however, as Clinton leads Trump among women by 6 points while Trump's advantage among men is 10 points. Majorities said that both Trump and Clinton were worse than typical Republican and Democrat candidates for president, though more were likely to describe Clinton than Trump as ""about the same as usual."" The Elon poll also surveyed likely voters on their perceptions of the candidates' health -- a major focus in the presidential race after Clinton was diagnosed with a case of pneumonia two weeks ago. Seventy-seven percent of North Carolina voters said they think Trump is healthy enough to be president, but only 56% said the same about Clinton. Opinions were sharply divided along partisan lines. Additionally, just under half said that both Clinton and Trump had not provided enough medical information. Read More",0.041025641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.082051282,0.307692308,0.005128205,2,-1,1

"On Monday, Donald Trump gave a speech in Estero, Florida that focused on the latest terrorist attacks in New York, New Jersey and Minnesota. He used it to give a blistering indictment of President Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for their feckless handling of the Middle East and Islamic terrorism in general-which they are unable or unwilling to even name. As usual, the Clinton-Obama conglomeration (for lack of a better word) came out with their typically vanilla response to the above terrorist attacks. White House spokesman Josh Earnest came out with yet another boffo explanation that we are in a ?war of narratives with ISIS.? Clinton stated on Sunday that it would be wise not to speak out before all the facts were in (I am paraphrasing), and that we needed to ?steel our resolve? whatever that means. Then on Monday she stated thatTrump rhetoric was giving aid and comfort to the enemy, a form of treason, no less. ?Donald Trump is being used as a recruiting sergeant for ISIS,? Clinton said on Monday morning. ?The kind of language and rhetoric Trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries.? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8TpV_PxuhU Yes, Hillary. All these atrocities are happening because ofTrump rhetoric. There is no doubt that Trump is going to at least give us a feel for how he is going to battle Islamic terror. He already has given us some in his references to limiting Muslim immigration. Now that he has modifiedit by talking about ?extreme vetting,? Clinton has jumped on the bandwagon saying that she has always supported enhanced vetting ? this as she actively supports a dramatic increase in Syrian refugees ? over five times as many asObama 10,000. Trump, for his part, while not telegraphing our moves to the enemy, needs to let us know something about his military intentions. My sense is that he will try to bring NATO and our Arab allies together into a fighting force that will go into Syria, Iraq and Libya to destroy the ISIS army in the air and on the ground. That done, it is up to the West to take whatever steps we can to keep ISIS terrorists out of our lands. It goes without saying that our immigration policies must be drastically revised. (In Europe, it may be too late.) I truly think that the majority of the American people ? while not wanting to massively violate the rights of American Muslims ? are not happy with ourgovernment responses to Islamic terror, even more so as we are attacked on our own soil. Hillary Clinton plainly promises more of the same if elected. They know that Islamic terrorists are at war with us and intend to carry out that war on our own streets. While not painting all Muslims with the same brush, it is clear to all that terrorists are walking among us. We know that future attacks are being planned as we speak. By various estimates, the current Muslim population in the US is around 1%. That amounts to a few million people, who are immigrants, naturalized American citizens, or younger people actually born here. Forget about mass roundups, deportations or internments. We can adopt a zero-tolerance policy for non-citizens who violate our laws and kick them out, but by and large, it will be up to law enforcement and the courts to remove the terrorists and plotters from our midst. In the meantime, that 1% must not be allowed to grow. If we are having these problems at 1%, what do you think it will be like at 5% or 10% or higher? Far beyond a religion, this is a political ideology that is incompatible with our constitution ? a belief system, if you will. We once kept communists from entering the US based on their belief system, which would have subverted our democracy. We need to find a way to do it again ? if for no other reason than to protect our citizens from harm. Trump wants to find a way to accomplish that. If Trump handles this issue sensibly, it can be a winner for him. Without castigating an entire community, all he has to do is talk aboutHillary failures and reluctance to go beyond what she and Obama have already done (or not done) in responding to Islamic terror ? which theywon even name. However, he also has to convince us he has a concrete plan to destroy ISIS and protect the American people.

"The ?psychological profile,? as the analysis is being called, is based on a statistical analysis of videos from 16 years' worth of HillaryClinton debates. | Getty 2016 Trump team builds 'psychological profile' of Clinton for debate The GOP nominee and his team are taking a more sophisticated approach to debate preparation than previously known. DonaldTrump team has created a detailed analysis of HillaryClinton debate style ? including her body language and verbal tics ? with the goal of helping the GOP nominee exploit weaknesses duringMonday debate, according to three sources familiar withTrump preparations. The ?psychological profile,? as the analysis is being called, is based on a statistical analysis of videos from 16 years' worth ofClinton debates, dating back to her 2000 campaign for Senate in New York, according to the operatives. They said it was assembled with assistance from a political data firm called Cambridge Analytica that specializes in psychographicmodeling of voters and donors, and thatTrump top advisers have been pleased with the results. Story Continued Below The advisers believe that the profile proves that Clinton has significant weaknesses and that they have identified her tells? words, phrases or gestures she uses whenshe unsure of an answer, or is trying to deflect her way out of an uncomfortable question, according to the operatives familiar with the preparations. For example, according to one of the sources, an operative who works with the campaign,Trump debate prep team believes that the profile proves that when ""she doesn't know the answer, she says this, etc.? The goal, said the operative, is to get Trump to recognize the tendencies, ?so when he hears her say 'X' he knows what is going on, and can respond accordingly.? Another source, who has advisedTrump aides on analytics, said thatTrump debate team is using the profile to coach the candidate on the most fruitful moments and responses to aggressively challenge Clinton. ?They think this psychological profile can predict howshe respond based on her body language and other stuff, and to tune Trump in to recognize and leverage that,? the analytics operative said, though he questioned the efficacy of the technique. ?It?s really wacky pseudo-science.?Trump campaign did not respond to questions aboutTrump debate preparations, the analysis or CambridgeAnalytica role therein. Andit unclear the degree to which Trump is heeding advice offered by his team based on the analysis, though The New York Times reported Friday that Trump has been watching video ofClinton ?best and worst debate moments, looking for her vulnerabilities.? But the creation and use of the analysis at least partially calls into question the widespread perception thatTrump debate preparations are unsophisticated and unstructured ? especially compared toClinton rigorous studying and moot-court-style mock debates.Clinton study materials reportedly also include assessments ofTrump psychology, his varying moods and recommendations for throwing him off his game. Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri suggested her campaignwasn much worried about the Trumpteam psychological analysis of Clinton. ?Good luck,? she said Friday when she was asked about this story during a pre-debate media conference call. ?We all have seen [Clinton] endure a lot of tough questioning over the years. We saw her endure 11 hours of tough questioning at the Benghazi hearing. And Donald Trump may thinkhe the personwho going to be able to really get under her skin, but I doubt it.? The Trumpteam psychological analysis of Clinton ? and CambridgeAnalytica involvement in it ? also is testament to the growing clout inTrump orbit of the father-daughter duo of Bob and Bekah Mercer. The Mercer family, which has given $2 million to a pro-Trump super PAC that Bekah Mercer runs, largely owns Cambridge Analytica, and encouraged the Trump campaign to incorporate thecompany services into its operations. The company, which is the U.S. subsidiary of the British intelligence firm SCL Group, specializes in building ?psychographic profiles? of voters. It has been retained by a number of campaigns and committees backed by the Mercers in recent years, including that ofTrump rival in the GOP primary Ted Cruz. Cruz's campaign paid the firm $5.8 million for everything from polling to digital advertising to voter and donor modeling, according to Federal Election Commission filings, which show that the company was paid another $675,000 by a Mercer-funded super PAC supporting Cruz. Soon after Cruz dropped out of the race, however, the Mercers switched their support to Trump, and began encouraging the campaign to use Cambridge Analytica. FEC filings show that the Trump campaign in July and August paid the company $350,000 for data management. But campaign sources say the company is providing a broad array of services to the campaign, both out of thecampaign roughly 60-person data, digital and technology operation in San Antonio and, to a lesser extent, in thecampaign Manhattan headquarters. Additionally, sources familiar with the company said that its board includes Trump campaign chief executive Steve Bannon, whose addition to the campaign was encouraged by Bekah Mercer. Campaign sources say Bannon is participating in the debate preparation sessions, as is campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, another Mercer ally whose hiring Bekah Mercer encouraged. Bannon and Cambridge Analytica declined to comment for this story, while Conway and a Mercer family spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.

"HS Student Fights Teacher Kids no longer see teachers as authority figures. Look at how the Left look at police. So, why should a student respect a teacher, when the Left say shooting police is ok?

"John Kerry speaks to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, back to camera, during their meeting in Moscow, on July 15. | AP Photo Foreign Policy Kerry's optimism is put to the test Critics say the chaos in Syria is making him look weak in his relentless push for a peace deal. NEW YORK ? John Kerry has been called an ""indefatigable optimist,"" the kind of guy determined to try, try again in spite of tough odds. It's a drive that helped him push through the Iran nuclear deal and keeps him searching for ways to solve the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. But the latest chaos in Syria has critics saying he may be trying too hard this time ? looking weak in the process and undermining his own goal of a peace deal. Story Continued Below A Syrian cease-fire that Kerry announced less than two weeks ago is near collapse. The first big blow came Saturday after an apparently errant U.S. airstrike believed to have killed dozens of Syrian government soldiers instead of Islamic State terrorists not party to the truce. Then, on Monday, suspected Syrian government airstrikes hit an aid convoy, killing at least 12 people and infuriating moderate rebels already wary of making a deal with Syrian President Bashar Assad. And late on Tuesday, a report emerged that U.S. intelligence indicates that Russian forces actually carried out the strike. By any measure, the developments are a blow to the 72-year-old secretary of state. Still, on Tuesday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Kerry met yet again with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Syria's de facto international representative, to see what could be done to salvage the cease-fire. ""He seems unaware that it's simply impossible to win at the negotiating table what you do not win on the ground, and he seems to be unaware that he keeps getting outsmarted and outmaneuvered by Lavrov,"" Elliott Abrams, a former deputy national security adviser in Republican George W. Bush's administration, wrote in an e-mail to POLITICO. ""His defenders say well, better to try than to give up, but that is wrong. He looks weak, and that makes the United States look weak."" The argument to keep trying is compelling. An estimated half-million people have died in the Syrian civil war since March 2011, and millions more have been displaced from their homes. Syria's misery is likely to be the biggest stain on Kerry's legacy as secretary of state, not to mention Barack Obama's legacy as president. Kerry's defenders grouse that he is being unfairly criticized by detractors who fail to offer reasonable alternatives ? scenarios that won't slip the U.S. into another war in the Middle East. And the secretary of state himself, wherever he goes, insists that the problem in Syria must ultimately be solved through a political, not military solution. ""What he's trying to do on Syria isn't about his legacy ? he doesn't view it in those terms,"" a State Department official told POLITICO. ""Critics can claim all they want that he is being unrealistic, but theyaren sitting in the room like the rest of us watching him work tirelessly to try to find a way through, leveraging every ounce of personal relationships he has to reach [an] accord. Never once have I heard him talk blindly about trust.It always been a sober assessment of the interests at stake and an honest effort to negotiate. The man knows people, and he knows how far he can take things."" Added a former administration official of Kerry: ""I just don't think he gives two thoughts to whether some wise guy in Washington believes he shouldn't have tried. He would want to hear their alternative."" But the Russians, and for that matter the Syrians, have little incentive to acquiesce to an administration that's on its way out; and Moscow appears either unwilling or unable to rein in Assad. The Syrian dictator, bent on staying in power, appears impervious to criticism from enemies and pleas from allies. Robert Ford, a former Obama administration ambassador to Syria, said Kerry's tactics, not his intent, pose a risk. ""I?m full of admiration for him for being willing to try.He not afraid to grapple with big issues, and I think he deserves some credit for that,"" said Ford, now at the Middle East Institute. ""What?s not clear is whether his constantly going back to the Russians over and over again is helping or hurting his efforts to convince them. It's making him look weak. Idon know that the Russians do things out of kindness or if instead they take advantage of weak players and weak countries."" Part of the problem for Kerry, observers say, is that Obama appears to have zero interest in committing more military muscle to give his secretary of state leverage in the talks with Russia. ""Time will prove that Kerry played a weak hand as good as he could,"" said Randa Slim, an analyst also with the Middle East Institute. ""The blame for U.S. inaction in Syria and its consequences should rest on Obama's shoulders, not Kerry's."" It also doesn't help that there are divisions within the Obama administration over what to do about Syria. More than 50 U.S. officials signed a memo leaked earlier this year that urges U.S. airstrikes on the Assad regime. Kerry himself is reported to have asked Obama to allow airstrikes on specific Syrian government targets to put Assad on notice, but Obama, wary of deepening the U.S. military role in the conflict, has declined. The recent bargain Kerry struck with Russia on Syria also has upset the Pentagon because it included coordination between Moscow and Washington on airstrikes against terrorist groups such as the Islamic State. Defense officials are extremely wary of sharing intelligence with Russia. Kerry's defenders insist he is not naive, despite his professed faith in the power of negotiations. For instance, at least twice during the marathon talks that led to the nuclear deal with Iran last year, Kerry reportedly became fed up with Iranian intransigence and threatened to quit the negotiations. In fact, Kerry's determination to get a deal with Tehran fueled similar questions last year about whether he was too eager for a legacy-making accomplishment. Kerry has spent most of his life in public service, but he's been dogged by criticism that he passed too few notable bills during his years as a lawmaker. He also failed to defeat Bush in the 2004 race for the White House. Another challenge Kerry has tried to solve repeatedly is the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians. After taking over as secretary of state in 2013, Kerry pushed the two sides to try once again to come to terms. But ultimately that effort sputtered. The Syria crisis is in many ways more complex than the decades old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Not only is the carnage ongoing and on an extraordinary scale, the sheer number of Syrian groups involved and international actors taking sides makes three-dimensional chess look easy. The cease-fire currently on the brink in Syria isn't even the first one Kerry has helped devise. A truce reached in February kept hold for several weeks before eventually collapsing. Then, too, Kerry worked long hours to negotiate with the Russians to agree to the cease-fire. That was alongside on and off initiatives to bring Syrian rebel leaders and Assad's representatives to the bargaining table for a long-term deal. On Monday, following the airstrike on the U.N. aid convoy, senior administration officials briefing reporters had tough words for Russia, saying it was responsible for the Syrian government's actions. ""The Russians have the responsibility certainly to restrain ? refrain from taking such action themselves, but they also have the responsibility to keep the regime from doing it,"" one official said. ""The burden is on the Russians to demonstrate ... quickly and in a significant way, that they are committed to this process, which ? without which obviouslywe not going to be able to move forward with them."" The administration's tone was more restrained following Tuesday's meeting between Lavrov, Kerry, and others involved in the Syrian peace effort. A readout from the State Department said participants decided they needed to meet again, but agreed that despite the violence, ""there was still an imperative to pursue a nationwide cessation of hostilities.""

"A group of Senate Democrats have asked the U.S. Department of Labor to open an investigation into whether Wells Fargo violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The letter follows a hearing on Capitol Hill this week that saw bank CEO John Stumpf face blistering questions from senators over a scandal involving allegations from regulators that employees opened accounts without customers' knowledge or permission. Separately, Stumpf resigned from his position on the Federal Advisory Council effective today, the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank told ABC News. The council generally meets with the Federal Reserve four times a year to advise it on banking and economic issues. The FLSA establishes standards for wage, overtime, youth employment and record-keeping for both the private and public sector, according to the DOL's website. Among other stipulations, the FLSA mandates that non-exempt employees receive overtime pay equal to 1.5 times his or her regular rate, if the employee works more than 40 hours per week. Describing Wells Fargo's opening or attempted opening of the accounts as ""fraud,"" the senators wrote in a letter to Labor Secretary Tom Perez and DOL Administrator David Weil that ""the suggestion last week by Chief Executive John Stumpf that '[t]here was no incentive to do bad things' at Wells Fargo -- a company that fired 5,300 employees over five years due to improper selling but made little effort to change its policies -- does not appear to be grounded in reality."" The reason for that, the senators claimed, citing media reports, is that ""dozens of former and current Wells Fargo employees have come forward to describe the lengths they went to in order to meet the bank's aggressive sales quotas,"" and, ""When quotas weren't met, employees faced threats of termination; mandated hours of unpaid overtime; harassment; and other forms of retaliation."" DOL spokesman Jason Surbey acknowledged that the agency had received the letter, and said: ""While we cannot discuss details of potential law enforcement decision-making, we do take the concerns raised in the letter very seriously."" On Sept. 13, the bank said that it would end its sales goals program effective Jan. 1, 2017. In response to the senators' request to the DOL, Wells Fargo spokeswoman Jennifer G. Dunn told ABC News today that ""our team members are our greatest asset."" ""We strive to make every one of them feel valued, rewarded and recognized and we pride ourselves on creating a positive environment for our team members, including market competitive compensation, career-development opportunities, a broad array of benefits, and a strong offering of work-life programs,"" Dunn added.

"House Speaker Paul Ryan is pushing to ease some drug-related sentencing requirements. | Getty Ryan pushes sentencing reform in face of skeptical GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan is facing a major obstacle in his months-long quest to pass criminal justice reform: unenthused House Republicans still skittish about looking soft on crime. The Wisconsin Republican for weeks has repeated his personal desire to move a bipartisan package that would include allowing well-behaved nonviolent prisoners to be eligible for early release and easing some drug-related sentencing requirements. Story Continued Below It would mark a major accomplishment for the speaker, and a chance for Republicans to show racial minorities they care about issues of social justice ? plus a salient, positive message countering DonaldTrump racially charged bid for the White House. But the odds are decidedly long. With Trump advocating for controversial policies like systematic ?stop and frisk,? and the protests in Charlotte, North Carolina, against police-involved shootings causing racial tensions to flare,Ryan conference is not eager to vote on the matter. An internal GOP leadership surveylast week taking House Republicans? temperature on the issue showed that most members were lukewarm at best. That means that if Ryan wants to make a push for criminal justice reform after the election, he will have his work cut out. ?It?s not an easy thing to make these reforms, and the [Judiciary] committee has taken some time doing it; nowthey taking time educating members on it,? Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Monday of a package of bills drafted by the Judiciary Committee. ?It is a priority for the speaker. There are concerns ? sowe getting all the questions answered.? The Judiciary panel last year passed 11 bills to reform federal sentencing laws and improve the prison re-entry system. While the package would not eliminate mandatory minimum sentences, it would significantly reduce sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. It would also create a program to reduce recidivism rates. The politics of criminal justice reform have soured for conservative supporters. Trump has warned repeatedly of dangerous, crime-ridden cities. And the FBI on Monday released new statistics showing that murders increased 11 percent and violent crimes rose 4 percent in the U.S. last year. Though the rates are still low by recent historical standards, it's enough to make law-and-order Republican lawmakers nervous. While proponents argue that reform would go a long way toward easing racial tensions, opponents vowthey never vote against the recommendations of law enforcement during a time of unrest. (Some Republican lawmakers worry that law enforcement could come out against the pitch, though many national police groupshaven taken a position.) Even if Ryan managed to get a bill through the House, the Senate and its 60-vote threshold could stop it in its tracks. Hawkish Republicans, including Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Jeff Sessions of Alabama, have been sounding the alarm against criminal justice reform. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has shied from the matter because it divides his conference. Democrats by and large support the reform proposals. Sources familiar withRyan thinking sayhe not ready to relent just yet because of the charged political environment. While hewasn able to pass the Judiciary package in September as he originally hoped, Ryan is now eyeing the lame-duck session, by which time tensions might have eased. ?I?m trying to get criminal justice reform done this session of Congress,? Ryan said last week during a speech at the Economic Club of New York. ?That train is on the tracks, andI hoping we can get that done sooner rather than later.? The speaker has made second chances and redemption a central theme of his ?Better Way? policy agenda, and he views criminal justice reform as key to helping people trying to turn their lives around. During the New York speech, he talked about visiting impoverished communities and being inspired by a onetime drug dealer who became a counselor to addicts, and a gang leader who went on to become an entrepreneur. ?I went in expecting to see the worst of America and I came out realizing I had just seen the best of America,? he said. Ryan will have the backing of some big-name conservative allies. The Koch brothers and the conservative group Americans for Tax Reform are major advocates of criminal justice reform. But the skepticism or resistance among Republicans is real. ?Itdoesn sell back home right now,? said Rep. Bill Flores of Texas, chairman of the Republican Study Committee. ?When you say, ?Hey,I voting for criminal justice reform,?they say, WhatYou?re letting prisoners out of prison early??? While he personally believes the Justice Committee has crafted some smart proposals, Flores said itdoesn help thatit a key priority of President Barack Obama. The situation in Charlotte and elsewhere has also complicated the equation. ?I think that what could be a good bill could be perceived differently because of current events,? he said. Rep. Peter King of New York saidhe struggling to make up his mind on the pending reform measures. ?I have friends on both sides of the issue, but Idon know,? he said. ?You?re talking about undoing 20 to 30 years of legislation. What are the unintended consequences?? Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, who leads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said criminal justice reform ?has real merit? but that there are ?also some concerns.? ?Ifyou actually going to let people out of prison early, we better make surethey not violent people,? he said Sunday on C-SPAN?s Newsmakersshow. ?Solet do it, butlet do it right.? House leaders hosted a series of member and staff meetings during the August recess to familiarize Republicans with the Judiciary bills. GOP leadership sources say these sorts of sessions can move the needle, andthey hoping that, over time, the conference will come around. Ryan, however, is racing against the clock. House Republicans will have to fund the government for all of 2017 during the lame-duck session, a contentious issue for the unruly GOP conference.It unclear whether Ryan will have the political capital and the bandwidth to do both.",0.024901704,0.00655308,0.007863696,0.01965924,0.044560944000000005,0.294888598,0.0013106160000000001,2,-1,1
"Scratch one big economic worry off the list for Hillary Clinton. Federal Reserve policymakers on Wednesday kept their key interest rate steady, avoiding a potential stock market disruption and putting the central bank on the sidelines until after Election Day. Story Continued Below Fed Chair Janet Yellen also strongly rejected claims lobbed at her by GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump that she is keeping rates artificially low to boost stock prices and aid Democrats. ?I can say emphatically that partisan politics plays no role in our decisions about the appropriate stance of monetary policy,? Yellen said at a news conference after the Fed announced its decision. ?We do not discuss politics at our meetings and we do not take politics into account in our decisions.? Nonetheless, theFed actions can have significant political consequences. The Federal Open MarketCommittee decision means voters are not likely to see big stock-price declines or a slowing economy before the Nov. 8 election. Clinton is counting on slowly improving views of the economy to hold off a late surge from Trump, who has made dissatisfaction with the sluggish pace of growth a centerpiece of his populist campaign. Stocks rose following theFed announcement. ?The Clinton campaign should absolutely breathe a sigh of relief, because the market was just not positioned at all for a rate increase; there would have been total chaos,? said Brett Ewing, chief market strategist at First Franklin Financial Services. ?Less drama is clearly good for the incumbent party.? At her news conference, Yellen said she saw improvement in the U.S. economy but little evidence of risky inflation. And she said holding off on a hike could allow more people to come back into the labor force. ?We are generally pleased with how the U.S. economy is doing,? she said. ?The economy has a little more room to run than might have been previously thought, andthat good news. And remember that inflation continues below 2 percent.? The move cheered investors who have driven stocks to fresh highs this year in large part fueled by theFed continued easy money policy. Yellen and the Fed also offered reassuring words about the state of the economy while pointing to a possible rate hike in December. ?[T]he labor market has continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity has picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year,? the Fed said in its eagerly awaited statement Wednesday. ?The Committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened but decided, for the time being, to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives.? TheFed decision on Wednesday is not a complete victory for the Clinton campaign. By declining yet again to raise rates, theworld most powerful central bank is signaling that it does not believe the U.S. economy is strong enough for even the slightest tightening of monetary policy. The Fed raised rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade. But it has been unwilling to do so again despite an unemployment rate of just 4.9 percent and warnings that inflation could spike in ways that would be difficult for the Fed to control. TheFed target rate is now just 0.25 percent to 0.50 percent, a remarkably low figure this late in an economic recovery that gives the central bank little room to maneuver should a new crisis or recession arise. So theFed move avoids a market meltdown but offers fresh rhetorical evidence for Trump and other Republicans who argue that the economy is extraordinarily weak. ?It?s certainly better for Clinton not to have a negative market reaction, but the story here is also that Fed does not have high confidence in continued improvement in the economy,? said Michael Obuchowski of Merlin Asset Management. ?Andthat something Trump can talk about, that the economy is so weak the Fedcan do anything even though it wants to.? The Fed also reduced its outlook for economic growth this year to 1.8 percent from 2 percent while keeping projections for 2 percent growth over the next two years unchanged. Trump has made bashing the Fed a central plank in his presidential campaign, repeatedly blasting Yellen as motivated by a desire to protect Democrats. ?She?s obviously political and doing what Obama wants her to do,? Trump said on CNBC earlier this month. ?I thinkshe very political, and to a certain extent, I think she should be ashamed of herself.? Trump has also said that as president he would replace Yellen, whose term runs until February 2018. And he has ripped the Fed for creating what he has called a ?false economy? with high stock prices but only modest wage gains and a very low labor-force participation rate. Yellen pushed back hard on the criticism on Wednesday. ?The Federal Reserve is not politically compromised,? she said. ?Ican recall any meeting that I have ever attended where politics has been a matter of discussion. I think the public if they had been watching our meeting on TV today would have felt that we had a rich, deep, serious, intellectual debate about the risks and the forecasts for the economy.? Yellen added that the central bank ?struggled mightily with trying to understand eachother points of view and come out at a balanced place and act responsibly, andthat my commitment to the American people.? Still, some Fed governors appear to agree with at least elements ofTrump critique. Three members of theFed policy-setting committee voted against the latest decision, the largest number in two years. These governors argued for a quarter-point increase. Some market observers note, however, that investors have already done some of theFed work by pushing up borrowing costs and generally tightening financial conditions without the Fed having to make an official policy move. ?Why does the Fed have to do anything if someone else is already doing the heavy lifting for them?? said David Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors. ?Why break your back?? As for 2016, Kotok said the decision should be a bit of a boost for Clinton, more because it avoids a nightmare scenario than does much to strengthen the economy. ?This at leastdoesn hurt her,? he said. ?Whether it actually helps is another question.?",0.033472802999999995,0.0041841000000000005,0.009762901,0.013947001,0.047419805,0.29288702899999997,0.0,2,-1,1

America desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness, that has not only gotten us through our toughest times ? becausewe had some tough times ? but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation. ?Everyday I see people of different backgrounds working together for common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country and become one American nation, united by shared values and principles as American citizens. We have to do it. And we have to respect our flag. We have to respect our flag. ?We all have to walk a mile in someoneelse shoes and see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. We have some real problems. And we do have a wounded country. ?Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screen. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be theworld leader. How can we lead when wecan even control our own cities? ?We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest, and demonstrate. But there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others. ?Every single American in our country is entitled to live in a safe community.

And the first duty of government is to protect their wellbeing and safety. We have to do that. ?There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration. ?Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disrupter, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and get their children great educations.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest on Friday raised the possibility of Obama vetoing the legislation Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) proposed Thursday, warning Republicans that the measure's lack of money for addressing Flint,Michigan lead crisis ? and its failure to include a change to campaign finance disclosure law that Democrats want ? raises serious concerns for the president. Story Continued Below ?You know, one of the reasons I was a little late in joining you all today is I had an opportunity to talk with the president in the Oval Office about this proposal, and after that conversationit not at all clear to me that he is prepared to sign this bill because he believes that Congress has got some work to do,? Earnest told reporters Friday at the daily press briefing. ?And hopefullythey get to work on that and get it done without putting the American people and the American economy through another cliffhanger related to a government shutdown.? Speaking from the Senate floor Thursday, McConnell praised what he called a ?clean continuing resolution? as ?many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle.? Congress has until next Friday to pass legislation to head off a government shutdown. ?It?s a fair proposal that funds all current government operations through Dec. 9, while also providing funding for the new legislationwe just passed overwhelmingly and that the president has signed ?that legislation to address the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic and the TSCA bill.,? McConnell said. According to the White House, though, it falls short of expectations. Earnest saidMcConnell proposal does include ?some attractive elements,? such as the fact that it would keep the government funded for a few additional weeks and help fund a response to the Zika crisis. ?We were, however, disappointed that for ? that Congress has not made a commitment to addressing the situation in Flint,? Earnest said, adding that while many Democrats are advocating for such, not enough Republicans are following suit. ?And the president is concerned that that situation has not been addressed in the context of these ongoing negotiations. Sohe concerned about that.? ?Thepresident also concerned about the fact that the proposal includes a rider that would essentially protect the ability of special interests to funnel money into political campaigns without having to disclose it,?

"Donald Trump and his children have for years promoted themselves and their real estate opportunities in Russia and other former Soviet states, and ethics experts say if he is elected President the get-tough U.S. sanctions against Russia could be in direct conflict with his business interests. Interested in Donald Trump? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Trump has said he will not participate in decisions about his business if he is elected to the White House and that those decisions will be left to his children in what they have called a ?blind trust.? But Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota law professor who served as ethics advisor to Republican President George W. Bush, said the arrangement would not fit his definition of a blind trust, and appeared ripe for potential conflicts. ?Idon see how you have a blind trust when you knowwhat in the blind trust,? Painter told ABC News. ?The appearance is that a foreign government or other foreign organization has influence over the president of the United States through financial dealings with his family and that would be unacceptable.? As questions have been raised aboutTrump business interests with Russians, the candidate has sought to distance himself from Moscow. ?For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia,? he wrote on Twitter in July. He later toldABC George Stephanopoulos, ?Will I sell condos to Russians on occasion? Probably. I mean I do that. I have a lot of condos. I do that. But I have no relationship to Russia whatsoever."" But an ABC News investigation found he has numerous connections to Russian interests both in the U.S. and abroad. ?The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars -- what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen,? said Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group and who says he once helped marketTrump U.S. condos in Russia and the former Soviet states. ?They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate?[and] be associated with Donald Trump.? Questions aboutTrump posture towards Russia have been a recurring issue in the 2016 presidential campaign. They have come from Democrats and Republicans, many of whom expressed surprise atTrump flattering remarks about Russian President Vladimir Putin, even as the official U.S. stance has grown increasingly frosty. ?I would treat Vladimir Putin firmly, butthere nothing I can think of thatI rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now so that we can go and knock out ISIS together with other people and with other countries,? he said. Peter Muhly - WPA Pool/Getty Images Sen. John McCain told a talk radio audience he was astonishedafter Trump praised Putin on the campaign trail. ?I think [it] shows either profound ignorance or an attitude that contradicts everything about the United States of America and our relations with our adversaries,? McCain said. The Russian Boom With Trump Branded Properties Long before he ran for president, Trump displayed an ongoing interest in Russia and the former Soviet states. He negotiated projects in the Republic of Georgia and Azerbaijan, neither of which was completed. And he and his children at different times toured Moscow in search of a site for a Trump project there. ?I know there were some drafts prepared for the [Moscow real estate] project when Donald Trump flew to Moscow. And he shared those drafts with some of the Russian businessmen,? Millian said, adding, ?It didn't go any further at the moment.? Trump was involved in a range of deals with Russian-born business executives, including the developer of the Trump project in Toronto. One of his partners in Trump Soho recruited financing from investors in Russia and Kazakhstan, according to court filings. And in 2013, Trump earned a cut of the proceeds when a Russian oligarch paid to host the Miss Universe Pageant at his venue in Moscow. Alexander Nemonov/AFP/Getty Images At the same time, wealthy Russians accounted for significant profits at Trump projects in the U.S.. Throughout the 2000s, records show Russians were buying into Trump branded real estate. ABC News conducted a review of hundreds of pages of property records and found that Trump-branded developments catered to large numbers of Russian buyers. This was most notable at the Trump licensed condo towers in Hollywood and Sunny Isles, Florida. Local real estate agents credited the Russian migration for turning the coastal Miami community into what they called ?Little Moscow.? Trump Organization General Counsel Alan Garten told ABC News the firm does not track the nationality of buyers, but he does not believe Russians spent any more money on Trump ventures than those from other regions. ?This whole fascination with this connection is overblown and misleading,? Garten said. Garten said the Trump Organization played no part in determining which market to pursue ? the strategy used to attract buyers was entirely the purview of the developer. ?In a license dealwe not selling the unit,? Garten added. ?That is a contact between the developer of that project and the buyer.We not selling anyone anything.? In the case of the Trump towers alongFlorida coast, they were sold by two separate builders with Trump licensing his name to the projects. But the licensing agreements required Trump to participate in the marketing of the condos, and Trump received royalties for each unit sold, according to Gil Dezer, president of Dezer Development, which built six Trump buildings in Sunny Isles. ?He [Trump] obviously benefits from each apartment sold,? Dezer said. ?There was a licensing percentage there.? Dezer describedTrump hands-on approach to the projects, with involvement in every detail of the construction. ?He would come in and he knew exactly what he would want,? Dezer said. Fishing for Russian Billionaires There is ample evidence in Russian media from that period in the 2000s that brokers mounted a significant effort to attract buyers to Trump properties in Florida, Toronto and New York. And Trump and his children participated in those campaigns. During the marketing of the Trump SoHo project, in which Trump licensed his name to a group that included Russian investors, the Trump family met with a group of Russian journalists at their New York offices to help boost interest in the project, according to Russian media reports. During the meeting, Trump was quoted telling the gathering of Russian journalists: ?I really like Vladimir Putin. I respect him. He does his work well. Much better than our Bush.? Eric Trump and Donald Jr. were also present, and were quoted praising the importance of Russian condo buyers, many of whom have purchased units in Trump buildings in seven-figure, cash-only deals. ""As the experience of the past few years shows, the best property buyers now are Russian,? Eric Trump is quoted as saying. ?They're different in that they can go around without a mortgage loan from American banks, that require income checks and they can buy apartments with cash.? Garten said the Trump Organization did not fly Russian journalists to New York to tout the SoHo project, or any other. ?If such a trip took place it would have likely been arranged by the developer or the broker for the project - not us,? he said. Rising Russian Interest Stalled by Sanctions Victoria Shtainer, a New York real estate agent who specializes in the high-end market, said the interest from Russian buyers rose in the early 2000s as Russians started to accrue wealth and began looking for a safe place to move their money. ?They felt that the United States is a place where they could park their money and have their children go to school and have a future here,? she said. ?America has always been the dream.? Advertisements began appearing in Russian media. Real estate agents marketing Trump projects showed glossy photos of the Florida oceanfront properties, such as one licensed development called Trump Hollywood. ?An exclusive location on the Gold Coast,? read the Russian subtitles on one online video. ?Excellence is felt in every look and every touch.? Daniel Pansky, a Florida broker who specializes in Russian buyers, said the Trump branded was uniquely suited to Russian buyers, who equated his name with luxury. As sales piled up, ?Sunny Isles developed into a Little Moscow,? he said. ?A lot of local dry cleaners, restaurants, stores having menus and signs in Russian.? ?The Trump brand basically started the branding game here in south Florida,? said Pansky. ?The majority of clientele were from New York and Russian origin.? But Pansky and Shtainer told ABC News that purchases from Russian buyers in New York and Miami began to drop precipitously in 2014, when the U.S. imposed economic sanctions on Russia in response to the Russian military incursion into Crimea. To Russian buyers looking to move money out of their home country, Shtainer explained, the sanctions ?basically cut off their oxygen.? 'Trust Me' Should Trump come out on top in the elections in November, he has said he'll consider whether or not to lift sanctions on Russia. ?We?ll be looking at that, yeahwe be looking,? Trump responded in July when asked if he would roll sanctions back. Hope Hicks, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, said the Republican nominee has ""never issued a position on the matter one way or another"" and reiterated that he would be studying the issue. Trump's children said that if their father becomes president, they would abide by the ""blind trust"" and not talk business with him. ?And we'll act incredibly responsibly and my father already said that he would put the company into a blind trust and it would be run by us,? Ivanka Trump told ABC News last week. Donald Trump Jr. said his father would not be told about their deals: ?We're not going to discuss those things. We're just, it doesn't matter. Trust me.? Millian said he hopes Trump continues to pursue closer ties between the U.S. and Russia. He recently posted a Trump donation card on his Instagram feed. ?He knows that a lot of Russians love his properties,? Millian said. ?They buy his luxury residences.

"Giuliani slams Lester Holt for fact-checking like Candy Crowley Presidential debate moderator Lester Holt pulled two Candy Crowleys, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Tuesday, accusing of the ?NBC Nightly News? anchor of mirroringCrowley infamous Mitt Romney fact-check twice on Monday night. In an interview with ?Fox and Friends,? Giuliani said he watched the debate two times ? once live, ?and then I went home and I watched Lester Holt do Candy Crowley at least twice.? Story Continued Below Donald Trump, who had suggested a debate without a moderator ahead ofMonday faceoff, warned Holt last week not to be like Crowley, who interrupted Romney in 2012 after the then-Republican nominee said it took President Barack Obama 14 days to call the attack in Benghazi, Libya, an ?act of terror.? (PolitiFact ratedRomney criticism ?half true,? noting that Obama did say ?act of terror? right after the attacks but that the administration did not speak ?consistently in the days that followed."") Giuliani took issue with Holt ignorantlyattempting to fact-check Trump on the constitutionality of stop-and-frisk and the real estate mogul's false assertion that he never supported the Iraq War. A federal judge in New York ruled the application of the practice unconstitutional, not the policy itself, as Holt suggested, Giuliani argued. ?The thingthat wrong is Lester Holt said straight out: Stop-and-frisk is unconstitutional. Lester Holt is not a lawyer,? Giuliani said. ?He?s wrong. It was decided in 1959 by Earl Warren. It is still the law of the land.? The former mayor maintained that ?every cop does stop-and-frisk in every part of America? but gave Hillary Clinton a pass for siding with Holt ?because she failed the bar exam.? ?ButI not gonna allow him to play lawyer and contradict our candidate,? he continued. ?AndI like to know: When did a moderator become a fact-checker? And ifyou gonna be a fact-checker, you better darn be right.? ?I?m a lawyer.I not a moderator who misrepresents on television,? Giuliani said, after co-Steve Doocy noted that Giuliani was fact-checking Holt. ?I?m a lawyer. Am I angry about it? I thought after Candy Crowley we saw the last of it. What Holt did last night ? if journalism has ethics, if it has ethics, he violated the rules of ethics. Now ifyou gonna interrupt andyou gonna correct me in front of 100 million people, you better be right. He is dead wrong.? Giuliani continued this verbal broadside, slamming Holt for being ?completely unprofessional? and ?totally unethical? and suggesting that ?he should have had enough energy to check the sources? regarding whether Trump supported the Iraq War. ?I saw the tape, and he opposed the Iraq War before the Iraq War,? Giuliani said, despite numerous fact-checks that note Trump voiced support for the war during a 2002 interview with Howard Stern. ?A hundred million last night were misled by Lester Holt and so-called lawyer Hillary Clinton,?

"""Donald,you a sniveling coward,"" Ted Cruz said in March. | Getty 9 times Ted Cruz insulted Donald Trump before endorsing him Two months after he was booed off the stage at the Republican National Convention for snubbing hisparty presidential nominee, Sen. Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump on Friday. That declaration to vote for him, though, comes after the Texas senator openly disparaged his primary opponent repeatedly ? in part responding toTrump attacks on his wife and father. Story Continued Below 1. Early on, Cruz speculated thatTrump tax returns could show a mob connection In February, Cruz offered his take on why Trumphadn released his tax returns in an interview onNBC ?Meet the Press,? suggesting that they might show ?Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia.? ?The fact that Donald seems terrified to release his taxes suggests thatthere a bombshell there,? Cruz said. ?It?s natural to wonder, ?Well, what is it that he's hiding in his taxes??? 2. In March, Cruz called him a ?sniveling coward? Speaking to a group of reporters in Dane, Wisconsin, after Trump made a comment promising to ?spill the beans? on thesenator wife, Cruz pointed his finger and said, ?Donald,you a sniveling coward. Leave Heidi the hell alone.? ?It?s not easy to tick me off. Idon get angry often, but you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids,that do it every time,? Cruz said. 3. He also called Trump a ?big, loud New York bully? ?Let me be absolutely clear: Our spouses and our children are off bounds,? Cruz said . ?It is not acceptable for a big, loud New York bully to attack my wife.? 4. Also, ?a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women?Trump attacks, Cruz suggested , were actions of ?a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women.? 5. Cruz called one ofTrump theories nutsand ?just kooky? In May, after Trump cited a National Enquirer report that allegedCruz father may have had some involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Cruz addressed reporters in Evansville, Indiana: ?This morning, Donald Trump went on national television and attacked my father. Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK. Now,let be clear, this is nuts. This is not a reasonable position. This is just kooky.? 6. He also called him a ?pathological liar? who ?lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth? Also in Indiana, on the same day the state's voters would deliver a decisive victory to Trump, Cruz added : ?I?m gonna tell you what I really think of Donald Trump: This man is a pathological liar. Hedoesn know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth, and in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying.? 7. And Cruz was specific with the term ?pathological?: Trump is ?utterly amoral,? he said ?I say pathological because I actually think Donald, if you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon and one thing in the evening, all contradictory andhe pass the lie detector test each time. Whatever liehe telling, at that minute he believes it, but the man is utterly amoral,? Cruz said . 8. And, while he was at it, Cruz accused him of narcissism and being a ?serial philanderer? Continuing to unload in Indiana, Cruz offered : ?He combines [dishonesty] with being a narcissist, a narcissist at a level Idon think thiscountry ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and says, ?Dude,what your problem???? And: ?Donald Trump is a serial philanderer, and he boasts about it. This is not a secret.He proud of being a serial philanderer.? 9. In July, Cruz stillhadn forgiven Trump for the attacks on his family ?I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,? Cruz said, answering questions at a Texas delegation breakfast at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and facing backlash for not yet endorsing Trump. Referring to his pledge to support hisparty nominee, Cruz said that statement ?was not a blanket commitment that if you slander and attack Heidi I'm going to nonetheless go like a servile puppy dog"" and support him.",0.045302012999999995,0.003355705,0.001677852,0.016778523,0.073825503,0.273489933,0.0,2,-1,1
"Story highlights Trump was sitting in a chair onstage just a few feet away from King when he uttered the word Trump has pledged to help bring jobs and safety to impoverished minority communities Cleveland Heights, Ohio (CNN) The controversial boxing promoter Don King used the N-word while introducing Donald Trump during an event Wednesday at a church. King, who is black, said the word as he argued that African-Americans cannot achieve success by emulating white people, as they will remain ""negroes."" ""If you're poor, you are a poor negro -- I would use the n-word -- but if you're rich, you are a rich negro. If you are intelligent, intellectual, you are intellectual negro. If you are a dancing and sliding and gliding n***** -- I mean negro -- you are a dancing and sliding and gliding negro,"" King said, laughing along with the crowd after the slip-up. ""You're going to be a negro 'til you die."" Trump, who was already smirking as he listened to King, didn't change the expression on his face, but turned slightly uncomfortably to his special counsel Michael Cohen and the church's pastor, Darrell Scott, who head up Trump's diversity coalition. Trump, who said he personally invited King to introduce him, was sitting in a chair onstage just a few feet away from King when he uttered the word.

"They were searching for years. It finally happened. They eventually found their onetrue gem after lastyear failure. Now after years of searching, liberals finally feel likethey seen a woman who can win the Presidency. Ironically, the notion to find a TV star candidate was stolen from the fact that President Trump had a bit of a TV career to go along with the rest of his business ventures.It also not lost on anyone that there are no two names more synonymous with wealth in America than Donald Trump and Oprah Winfrey.It quite funny that people on the left kept spouting off that youcan have a television billionaire run for President ? but now they have their television billionaire they want to run for President. Funny how that works, right? The left has literally copied exactly what the right does becausethey unable to craft their own winning strategy. Liberals have found PresidentTrump antithesis and plan to run her against him in the next presidential election of 2020. Winfrey is also boosted by the fact that she has a couple of social justice warrior bonus points working in her favor;she black, andshe a she. She has everything that they said Hillary had, but without that annoying and predatory Bill tagging along for the free ride. The one other thing that Oprah has in common with President Trump is that her careerhasn been in politics. Shehasn had to look over her shoulder and watch her mouth for her entire life.She just been giving out prizes from under the seats of her show set and participating in other business ventures that have nothing to do with politics. In the case of President Trump, thatdidn matter too much, because hewasn running on a platform of political correctness.That where they differ. Oprah would most likely be on the plan with political correctness, something that America has gotten sick of hearing about. Oprah has given numerous honest and very liberal opinions over the years, and that is now coming back to haunt her. To make matters worse, the bumbling mainstream media is jumping up to defend her, andit not going well.It scary to think of Oprah Winfrey in the Oval Office as anything more than a guest taking a tour. Her unashamed opinion on race issues and disdain for white people could be a problem. The longtime TV host has become increasingly anti-white over the years, to the point thatshe handing down a proverbial death sentence to those whodon agree with her. Her idea is that racism is a problem of the past, so to fix the problem, those who lived in that time just need to die.That right folks. It was a horrible thing she said, and this video would be the bane of her existence if she ever ran for President. Oprah said as much in an interview in 2013: Oprah's solution to racism; Old white people ""just have to die"". What a horribly divisive message. pic.twitter.com/NOtaft2xxf ? Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) January 8, 2018 Aren't old people most of her audience? She would be out of a job if this happened. ? Frank Lea ?? (@TrendingViews1) January 15, 2018 Wow! For a billionaire there could have been a more ""eloquent "" way to say this. Money doesn't buy class. ? Kim (@KimKing2018) January 8, 2018It difficult to see someone who is considered to be a national leader asking for the death of hundreds of thousands of Americans.It even more painful to think people would want her to run the country with that attitude. Now, to be fair,she probably right about a small fraction of the older generation. There will always be at least a few people who say racially inappropriate things, but they do not stand for or represent the majority of our good Americans. Even if there are a few old cronies with a racist bone in their body, thatdoesn mean everyone is like that. That alsodoesn mean Oprah should call for a mass genocide of old white people. That is a terrible and racist thing to say. It makes Oprah look like the black female Hitler who calls for the killing of a particular kind of people. Is that who the American people would want to vote for? Idon think so. It is NOT EVER OK to suggest that Americans try to kill people off just because they disagree with someone. What Oprah said is unforgivable and disgusting. We cannot believe she would say anything like that. This probably seems exceptionally radical, based on what she just said, that someone would try to kill an old person becausethey racist, butit perhaps not as far-fetched as you might think. Currently, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington have ?death with dignity? laws that allow a terminally ill patient to voluntarily request and receive a prescription medication to hasten their death. This practice is also called euthanasia, which is a term that encompasses any physician-assisted suicide, and it dates back as far as ancient Greece and Rome. The United States is beginning to accept the reasoning that a person might need to die before their natural time, based strictly on the quality of life. Right now, as with most of the new technologies offered to us,it optional. If we decide that our lifeisn worth living, we can end it. However, throughout most of history, ithasn been the patient choosing whether to pull their plug. In a socialist society, whereit all for one and one for all, someone always has to decide what will be for the ?greater good.? In fact, Euthanasia comes from the Greek words, Eu (good) and Thanatosis (death) and it means ?Good Death, ?Gentle and Easy Death.? This word is used for ?mercy killing.? Withdrawal or with-holding treatment was practiced in history, the correct term for this is orthothanasia, which means ?passive death.? If you combine that with the incredibly scary, and over-reaching liberties taken in the Affordable Care Act (aka, Obamacare), then you can see how we were (and maybe still are) a hop, skip and a jump from the government choosing who lives and dies. If racism is considered cancer that should be cut out, then racism is redefined to mean anything liberals want, they would be able to hand down a death sentence to anyone the government wanted, by withdrawing care. ?Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.? That is what we were promised in the constitution, butwe now come full circle to the point where we need to depend on another truth given to us by a founding father: We must, indeed, all hang together or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately. ?

"Story highlights A Mark Kirk campaign website falsely asserted the Illinois was a veteran of the Iraq war The Republican senator has previously faced scrutiny for misrepresenting his service record (CNN) Sen. Mark Kirk's campaign falsely asserted on its website that the Illinois Republican was a veteran of the Iraq war, a misstatement that comes six years after exaggerations over his military record nearly cost him his state's Senate seat. The Republican, now battling for a second term in a tight race in Illinois, stayed in the United States during the Iraq War when he served in the Navy Reserves. But on a public webpage on his official campaign website touting his record on veterans' issues, Kirk was listed as a ""veteran of the Iraq war."" While Kirk campaign officials said it was a staff error, the issue resembles the controversy that nearly caused his 2010 Senate campaign to implode. Moreover, Kirk is now running for reelection against Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran who lost both of her legs during combat in Iraq. A once public, now private webpage on Mark Kirk's official campaign website touted his record on veterans' issues, Kirk was listed as a ""veteran of the Iraq war."" Kirk campaign officials said the webpage was not meant to be made public, saying that it was supposed to be a private site while edits were being made to the page. Campaign officials said a third-party vendor had drafted the language that they said had not been vetted or reviewed by the senator's staff. The language, they acknowledged, was inaccurate, saying it would be changed when the campaign began a more direct push to court military veterans.

"New York bomb Suspect SUED Police! Now we find out that not only is Ahmad Rahami a terrorist and a murderer,he an entitled whiner. Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. Ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area? you know, his culture. In the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ?Muslimsdon belong here?. The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in Newark, says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002. From April 2009 for two years they allege that they were unfairly targeted for staying open past 10pm despite being permitted to do so. ? 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

The Elizabeth police department allegedly ?embarked on a course to harass, humiliate, retaliate against and force their business to close at 10pm?. The lawsuit claims that the officers told them there was ?too much crime around here? and that the area around the restaurant was ?known for criminal activity?. The irony of it all is that just 5 years later, Ahmad was arrested for the very same thing he was fighting. Hmmm,it not like a person goes from selling fried chicken to building bombs in just 5 years, right?I wondering if anyone else can believe that Ahmad went off the reservation because he felt like he was being targeted for being a Muslim or ifit more believable that Ahmad is a Muslim who happens to be an extremist andhe been planning this for some time.",0.029090908999999998,0.014545455,0.007272727,0.029090908999999998,0.054545455,0.283636364,0.018181818,2,-1,0
