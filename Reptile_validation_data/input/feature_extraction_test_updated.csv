1923848149,Syria regime pounds Kurdish positions for second day,"Friday 19 Aug 2016 Syria regime pounds Kurdish positions for second day AFP Syrian regime warplanes bombarded the northeastern city of Hasakeh for the second day on Friday targeting positions held by Kurdish forces a monitor and a journalist in the city said. Fresh strikes came as the Pentagon said that US-led coalition fighter jets scrambled to protect Kurdish forces working with American advisers in Syria as they were targeted by regime planes Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights - which monitors the conflict and determines which planes carry out raids according to their type location flight patterns and the munitions involved - said Fridays strikes were conducted by regime jets. The journalist in Hasakeh said eight air strikes could be heard throughout the day mostly focused in the citys southwestern neighbourhoods. Most of Hasakeh city the capital of the northeastern province by the same name is controlled by Kurdish forces while the rest is held by fighters loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. Since Wednesday clashes between the two forces have rocked the city leaving 23 civilians - including nine children - and 16 combattants dead the Observatory said. The Britain-based monitor said thousands of inhabitants had begun to flee Hasakeh where bread was running out and electricity supplies have been cut. Thursdays government raids on Hasakeh were the first time the regime had bombarded Kurdish positions from the air. The development prompted jets from the US-led coalition battling the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq to intervene in order to protect Kurdish forces working alongside US advisors a Pentagon spokesman said Friday. ""This was done as a measure to protect coalition forces"" Captain Jeff Davis said. ""We did make clear that US aircraft would defend troops on the ground if threatened."" The Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) are a key US ally in the fight against IS. Washington regards them as the most effective fighting force on the ground in Syria and has provided weapons and special forces military advisers. IS controls most of the Euphrates valley to the south of Hasakeh and tensions between regime and Kurdish forces have sometimes led to armed clashes in spite of their common jihadist enemy. The Kurds who control much of northeastern and northern Syria along the Turkish border where they have proclaimed an autonomous Kurdish region recently demanded that the pro-government National Defence Forces disband in Hasakeh.

Unconfirmed reports over the use of chlorine gas on rebel-held areas in eastern Aleppo emerged after the offensive on the city began in late June. Rebels and activists have reported barrel bombs containing poisonous gas were dropped on residential areas around Aleppo but the lack of chemical labs or independent testers made it difficult to verify these claims. A worlds chemical weapons watchdog raised concerns earlier this month over the reports of chlorine gas attacks around Aleppo.

The UN-backed group based in The Hague ""continues to examine any credible reports"" of chemical weapons use the statement said. Uzumcu added that under international conventions the use of chemical weapons ""by anyone under any circumstances"" is seen ""as reprehensible and wholly contrary to the legal norms established by the international community.""

1926479349,Syria: have the Chemical Weapons gloves come off?,Friday 23 August 2013 Syria: have the Chemical Weapons gloves come off? As the international community tries to wrap its head around the recent allegations of chemical weapons attack in Syria numerous unanswered questions remain on the type of agent used and the party who carried it leaving the door open on the repercussions of such an attack on the diplomatic and military levels. News of the Ghoutta Massacre have surfaced on Wednesday with the opposition accusing the Syrian government of launching a Chemical attack and killing between 1000 and 1800 people. Understanding the attack Based on videos of responders that surfaced after the attack and the nature of casualties Gwyn Winfield editor of CBRNe World a publication that specializes in unconventional weapons tells Al-Arabiya that they suggest that it might be chemical biological or radiological device. The symptoms which included shortage of breath pinpoint pupils mucus secretions that it was a chemical attack but exactly which chemical it is is difficult to decide says the expert. Verifying the kind of agent used and getting specifics on the attack would require according to Winfield a sample of the agent itself or a blood or hair sample from a victim or casualty. The least value evidence would be water or soil from the area where the rockets landed. While lot of fingers have been pinpointed in different directions after the attack with the Assad regime denying the attack altogether and the opposition implicating the government three indications are mandatory to know in order to identify the source says Winfield. They are: the agent itself the delivery system (rocket/shell/mortar and the device that fires it) and the skill needed to bring the three together (personnel). The most difficult part in this is identifying the agent as Syria has the delivery system and skill in abundance. Winfield notes that the Assad regime has stated that they have a close hold on the agent a statement that is designed to assure Western powers as much as allies that the regime has control over these weapons. But the risk of the regime losing control over such material has long been a concern of Washington and neighbors of Syria. Winfield says that all the rebels would need is overrun an ammunition dump with a small supply of agent to stage such an attack. Repercussions The concern in Washington and in many Western capitals is that regardless of who staged the attack the turn of events towards chemical weapons use in Syria or these weapons falling in the wrong hands is a red line and a major security threat. Andrew Tabler a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy tells Al-Arabiya that if the chemical weapons use is confirmed on such a massive scale it will be much harder for the Barack Obama administration not to respond warning that this might be a sign of more systematic use in the future if we are not there already. The Wall Street Journal quoting Pentagon officials said yesterday that the U.S. began refining its military options for possible strikes in Syria. In a parallel effort Secretary of State John Kerry is working the diplomatic track and has placed calls to his French Russian and Turkish counterparts to discuss potential response. Obama told CNN today that core national interests are now at stake if Chemical weapons use is verified both in terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating as well as needing to protect our allies our bases in the region. Tabler does not expect an immediate military action however due to the time needed to plan militarily and for diplomacy and coalition building a priority for the Obama administration. Still he warns that Washington can not afford waiting too long. But even military action in the form of airstrikes would not resolve the Chemicals weapons threat. Winfield points out that it is very difficult to protect these weapons and the chances of killing everyone that knows how to operate these systems is slim as is the chance of destroying every mortar howitzer and rocket battery. He says that destroying a chemical agent is very difficult to do safely and it would require special forces on the ground something that the U.S. has been very reluctant about doing in Syria.,arabiya,against,0.0,1.0,0.355231144,0.00729927,0.00243309,0.02189781,0.051094890999999996,0.024330900000000003,0.8157189229999999,1

1926479354,Islamic State beheads crucifies in push for Syrias east,August 11 2014 Islamic State beheads crucifies in push for Syrias east. Oliver Holmes Suleiman Al-Khalidi. Islamic State has crushed a pocket of resistance to its control in eastern Syria crucifying two people and executing 23 others in the past five days a monitoring group said on Monday. The insurgents who are also making rapid advances in Iraq are tightening their grip in Syria of which they now control roughly a third mostly rural areas in the north and east. Fighters from the al-Sheitaat tribe in eastern Deir al-Zor had tried to resist Islamic States advance this month according to residents near the area and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitoring organization. In al-Shaafa a town on the banks of the Euphrates river Islamic State beheaded two men from the al-Sheitaat clan on Sunday the Observatory said and gave residents a 12-hour deadline on Monday to hand over members of the tribe. In other parts of Deir al-Zor province the militants crucified two men for the crime of dealing with apostates in the city of Mayadin and two others were beheaded for blasphemy in the nearby town of al-Bulel the Observatory said. Islamic State which has fought the Syrian army Kurdish militias and Sunni Muslim tribal forces has made rapid gains in Syria since it seized northern Iraqs largest city Mosul on June 10 and declared an Islamic caliphate. The Observatory said a further 19 men from the al-Sheitaat tribe were executed on Thursday 18 shot dead and one beheaded on the outskirts of Deir al-Zor city. It said the men worked at an oil installation. No one will now dare from the other tribes to move against Islamic State after the defeat of the al-Sheitaat said Ahmad Ziyada al-Qaissi an Islamic State sympathizer contacted by Skype from Mayadin. Tribal sources say the conflict between Islamic State and the al-Sheitaat tribe who number about 70000 flared after Islamic State took over of two oil fields in July. One of those al-Omar is the biggest oil and gas field in Deir al-Zor and has been a lucrative source of funds for rebel groups. The head of the al-Sheitaat tribe Sheikh Rafaa Aakla al-Raju called in a video message for other tribes to join the fight against Islamic State. We appeal to the other tribes to stand by us because it will be their turn next ... If (Islamic State) are done with us the other tribes will targeted after al-Sheitaat. They are the next target he said in the video posted on YouTube on Sunday. WINNING RESPECT Damaged military vehicles that belonged to forces loyal to Syrias President Bashar al-Assad are parked at the armys 17th Division base after it was seized by fighters from the Islamic State outside Syrias northern Raqqa province August 10 2014. REUTERS/Stringer A Syrian human rights activist from Deir al-Zor who fled for Turkey last year said rebels opposed to President Bashar al-Assad had retreated to al-Sheitaat tribal areas from which they had been trying to mount resistance to Islamic State. He said on condition of anonymity that the resistance had been crushed in the last few days. The situation is very bad but the people cant repel them he said. He said that in tandem with their violent campaign Islamic State was distributing gas electricity fuel and food to garner local support. It is a poor area. They are winning support this way. They won a lot of support this way. They are halting theft and punishing thieves. This is also giving them credibility. Slideshow (2 Images) Another resident of Deir al-Zor Abdullah al-Noami said that four al-Sheitaat towns had fallen. These areas have fallen into the hands of Islamic State after the withdrawal of the (al-Sheitaat) fighters. The youths who were found were executed or their heads were cut off on the grounds that they fought against Islamic State he said. More than 170000 people have been killed in Syrias civil war which pits overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad a member of the Shiite-derived Alawite minority backed by Shiite militias from Iraq and Lebanon. The insurgency is split between competing factions with Islamic State emerging as the most powerful. In Raqqa Islamic States power base in Syria its hold appears to be growing only firmer even as Syrian government forces intensify air strikes on territory held by the group. One Syrian living in an area of Islamic State control near Raqqa said the number of its fighters in the streets had grown dramatically in the last few weeks particularly since it captured the armys 17th Division at the end of July. The group has levied a tax on non-Muslims and settled foreign fighters in confiscated homes said the resident who asked for anonymity due to security concerns. But despite that as in Deir al-Zor it has won a degree of respect among locals by curbing crime using their version law of and order. For youths without work salaries offered by Islamic State are one of the few sources of income. The (Islamic) State has respect and standing and its voice is heard said the resident speaking by Skype.

1926479015,Silence over Russias Crimes Serves Its Goal of Undermining Political Solution,Monday 11 January 2016 18:41 Silence over Russias Crimes Serves Its Goal of Undermining Political Solution. The Syrian Coalition strongly condemned the heinous massacre carried out by Russian warplanes in which 35 civilians mostly schoolchildren and teachers were killed and many more wounded. Three schools were targeted by Russian aircrafts earlier this morning in the town of Ain Jara in rural Aleppo. The Syrian Coalition stressed that the international community must act quickly against Russias flagrant crimes against the Syrian people including children women and the elderly. Russias actions in Syria while representing a continuation of Assads terror since the start of Syrian revolution are designed to break the will of the Syrian people and undermine the political solution. The Syrian Coalition reiterated that this crime and other crimes by the Assad regime and its allies represent a clear violation of UN Security Council resolution 2254 which calls for immediate cessation of all attacks against civilians. The silence of the international community over the crimes of the Assad regime and its allies against Syrian civilians as well as its complete disregard for their blood is a shameful stain on humanity. The failure to explicitly and clearly condemn the Russian aggression and the inaction towards Russias massacres against the Syrian people constitute outright support for these crimes. This silence also represents complicity in undermining efforts to find a political solution in Syria the Syrian Coalition added.,etilaf,against,0.006666666999999999,0.5,0.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026666667,0.013333333000000001,0.0010833330000000001,1
1924058138,Syria uses chemical weapons Turkey offers remedy - lnur evik - Daily Sabah,"Published April 5 2017 The jet fighters from the Syrian regime have attacked settlements in the Syrian province of Idlib with chemical weapons killing at least 70 people including dozens of women and children and displaying once again the barbarity of the Bashar Assad administration. All this is happening as the so-called cease-fire is in effect in the region and the Russians are ""monitoring"" it. Idlib was the target of the regime because opposition groups and those sympathizing with them have moved out of Aleppo through an agreement brokered by Turkey and Russia. The cease-fire was supposed to have secured protection for the people of Idlib but that has been proven wrong as the regime jet fighters attacked the city with chemical bombs. Local sources reported that Syrian helicopters also attacked several settlements in the area with barrel bombs containing chemical weapons. Doctors in the town of Khan Skeikhoun in the Idlib province held by the opposition said victims started to choke vomit and faint with foam coming out of their mouths. The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said women and children were among the dozens killed with reports of ""suffocation"" by barrel bombs. The Assad regime is back to using chemical weapons. So what will the international community do in view of this monstrous atrocity? The Assad regime has done this before and after the international uproar it had ""given up"" its chemical weapons to international observers. We were told Assad did not have chemical weapons. So now that Assad is back to using these weapons it seems the international community intentionally or unintentionally simply turned a blind eye and the Assad regime simply stored the weapons to be used at a future date. The Russian mentors of the terrorist Assad who themselves face terrorist attacks in their own backyard in St. Petersburg have to see that collaborating with terrorists only brings misery and destruction. This time Assad has to be stopped. The chemical weapons Assad uses have to be taken away from him for good and he has to pay for his atrocities. Even the Russians cannot stand behind Assad as he commits these gross violations. The Americans cant simply say they are just interested in fighting Daesh and just turn a blind eye to the dangerous turn of events in Idlib. Tomorrow someone in Syria may decide to use such weapons against the U.S. forces there.Turkey is trying to create its own secure zone that Assad would never dare attack in northern Syria.

Tags Syria Aleppo children deaths human rights lifeless body baby Bashar al-Assad Eleven children were killed on Thursday in a barrel bomb attack carried out by government forces on a rebel-held neighbourhood of Syrias Aleppo city. ""Fifteen civilians among them 11 children were killed in a barrel bomb attack on the Bab al-Nayrab neighbourhood"" in the south of Aleppo city the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said. The group also reported eight civilians including two children were killed on Thursday in rebel fire on the government-held west of the city. An AFP journalist in Bab al-Nayrab saw rescue workers and civilians digging through the rubble of collapsed buildings. One man carried out the lifeless body of a baby no bigger than his forearm. The babys eyes were closed and its body was white with dust except for speckles and smears of blood. Elsewhere a civil defence worker protected the face of another dead child as his colleagues scraped away the rubble encasing the rest of the childs body. Syrias regime has been accused of regularly using barrel bombs crude explosive devices on rebel-held areas that are home to civilians and other parties to the conflict are not known to have used the weapons. President Bashar al-Assad and his government deny using barrel bombs.

1924058139,At least 100 civilians dead in toxic gas attack in Syrias Idlib,"Published April 4 2017 The Assad regime has used chemical weapons once again killing at least 100 civilians including children in an airstrike that released on the opposition-held Idlib. Thirty ambulances were dispatched from Turkey to rescue those in dire need of help. The Assad regime continues to commit crimes against humanity as more than 100 civilians were killed and 500 others mostly children have been affected by the chlorine gas attack carried out by regime warplanes in the Khan Shaykun town in Idlib. The latest chemical attack was seen as the worst in the countys six-year war. With many civilians suffering respiratory problems in dire need of help Turkey dispatched 30 fully equipped ambulances for rescue operations. The reports claim that it was the third chemical attack in over a week in Syria as the Assad regime consistently targets residential areas. The first two attacks were reported in Hama province an area close to yesterdays chemical attack. After the gas attack the Syrian regime reportedly bombarded a hospital in the town where doctors were treating victims. Turkey condemned the chemical attack on Syrias opposition-held town of Idlib describing it as ""a crime against humanity."" The chemical attacks on Idlib were ""inhuman"" and ""unacceptable"" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said while stressing the importance of maintaining the fragile Syrian cease-fire. In a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin the president reiterated the need for further efforts to strengthen cooperation in the fight against terrorism. Foreign Minister Mevlt avuolu also stated that the suspected use of chemical weapons could derail the process of Syrian peace talks being held in Astana Kazakhstan. The parallel series of talks in Astana Kazakhstan aim to bolster the truce to support the U.N. negotiations. Damascus has been the scene of heavy fighting in recent days with the moderate Syrian opposition making large incursions into the east of the Syrian capital while the Assad regime has responded with airstrikes on opposition positions. The last round of Astana talks began on Feb. 23 and ended on March 4 without any clear result. The next meetings in Astana are to be held on May 3-4. The global chemical arms watchdog said it was ""seriously concerned"" by reports of a suspected gas attack. ""The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is seriously concerned about the alleged chemical weapons attack reported by the media this morning in the Khan Sheikhun area of southern Idlib"" the group said adding it was ""gathering and analyzing information from all available sources."" Chlorine gas is one of several elements and compounds used in devastating chemical attacks outlawed by international treaties. A high level of exposure to the gas can cause suffocation as the chemical injures the pulmonary airways resulting in severe fluid buildup in the lungs with children and seniors particularly vulnerable. In the wake of the 2013 attack Assad agreed to a Russia-sponsored deal to destroy his chemical arsenal and joined the Chemical Weapons Convention. His government declared a 1300-ton stockpile of chemical weapons and so-called precursor chemicals that can be used to make weapons amid international outrage at a nerve gas attack on the outskirts of Damascus. Those weapons have been destroyed but member states of the OPCW have repeatedly questioned whether Assad declared everything in 2013. The widely available chemical chlorine was not covered in the 2013 declaration and activists say they have documented dozens of cases of chlorine gas attacks since then. The Syrian government has consistently denied using chemical weapons and chlorine gas accusing the rebels of deploying it in the war instead. Frances foreign minister called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council after what he said was a ""disgusting"" gas attack on Syrias rebel-held Idlib province. ""In the face of such serious actions that threaten international security I ask for everyone not to shirk their responsibilities. With this in mind I ask for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council"" he added. France Britain and the United States in February put forward a resolution to impose sanctions targeting Syrian government officials over accusations of chemical weapon attacks during the six-year conflict.

Tags Syria Russia Idlib safe zone Turkey Assad SOHR At least 28 civilians were killed in airstrikes on northwestern Syria despite a planned safe zone. Four children were among the dead in the overnight strikes on the town of Armanaz in Idlib province near the Turkish border the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based watchdog had earlier reported 12 dead in the strikes on the town in Harem district around 20 kilometres northwest of the provincial capital Idlib. Entire apartment blocks had been flattened by the bombardment an AFP correspondent said. The Observatory said it could not immediately determine whether the strikes had been carried out by jets of the Syrian regime or its ally Russia. But they are the latest in an intensifying air campaign carried out by the two governments against jihadist fighters who control most of the province and are not party to a safe zone deal brokered by Russia Turkey and Iran. The surge in bombing raids has forced hospitals in the province to close medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Friday. They were triggered by an offensive by jihadist fighters led by al-Qaedas former Syria affiliate launched against regime-held villages in neighbouring Hama province on September 19. The jihadists control nearly all of Idlib province after driving out Islamist former allies earlier this year. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed on Thursday to step up efforts to establish a safe zone in Idlib as part of a wider agreement struck in May. Three other safe zones have already been set up - in Eastern Ghouta near Damascus parts of the south and some areas of the central province of Homs. But in some of those areas too the fighting has continued. Shelling by the army killed at least 21 civilians in Eastern Ghouta on Saturday more than half of them children the Observatory said. The de-escalation agreement excludes both the Islamic State group and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham the alliance dominated by al-Qaedas former Syrian affiliate. The Islamic State group is under attack in its remaining strongholds in eastern Syria by both Russian-backed government forces and US-backed fighters. On Thursday it mounted a counterattack against government forces along their supply lines through the desert to the eastern city of Deir Ezzor. At least 128 troops and militia were killed on Thursday and Friday as the army battled to restore control the Observatory said. State media have reported the IS counterattack but have made no mention of the armys losses.

1926479330,Death toll mounts after bomb blast on Aleppo evacuee bus convoy,Saturday 15 April 2017 Death toll mounts after bomb blast on Aleppo evacuee bus convoy. A bomb blast hit a bus convoy waiting to enter Aleppo on Saturday killing at least 100 and wounding hundreds more after an evacuation deal between Syrias warring sides halted and stranded thousands at two transit points on the city outskirts. Images posted by the outlets showed bodies lying next to charred buses with their windows blown out and flaming vehicles belching out thick black smoke. British-based monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights counted 24 dead and dozens more wounded. The blast hit buses in the Rashidin area on Aleppos outskirts which had been waiting to cross from rebel-held territory into the government-controlled city itself carrying people evacuated from two Shiite villages on Friday. The residents alongside hundreds of pro-government fighters had left the two rebel-besieged villages in northwest Idlib province under a deal where in exchange hundreds of Sunni insurgents and their families moved out of a government-besieged area near Damascus. But a delay in the agreement had left all those evacuated stuck at two transit points on Aleppos outskirts since late on Friday. Residents of al-Foua and Kefraya the Shiite villages were waiting in the Rashidin area. The rebels and residents of Madaya near Damascus were waiting at the government-held Ramousah bus garage a few miles away. They were to be transported to Idlib province which the armed opposition controls. The agreement is one of several over recent months that has seen President Bashar al-Assads government take back control of areas long besieged by his forces and their allies. The Observatory said the delay was caused by the fact that rebels from Zabadani another town near Damascus included in the deal had not yet been granted safe passage out. A pro-opposition activist said insurgents blamed the delay partly on the fact that a smaller number of pro-government fighters had left the Shiite villages than was agreed. Earlier on Saturday at the transit point where the buses from al-Foua and Kefraya were waiting one resident said he was not yet sure where he would live. After Aleppo Ill see what the rest of the group is doing if there are any preparations. My house land and belongings are all in al-Foua Mehdi Tahhan said. We had no choice A Madaya resident speaking from the bus garage inside Aleppo said people had been waiting there since late on Friday and were not being allowed to leave. Theres no drinking water or food. The bus garage is small so theres not much space to move around Ahmed 24 said. Were sad and angry about what has happened he said. Many people felt that they had been forced to leave he said. There was no other choice in the end - we were besieged inside a small area in Madaya. Syrias opposition says the evacuation deals which include areas of Aleppo and a district in the city of Homs amount to forced displacement of Assads opponents from Syrias main urban centers in the west of the country. The agreements are also causing demographic changes they say because those who are displaced are mostly Sunni Muslims. Syrias population is mostly Sunni. Assad is from the Alawite religious minority often considered an offshoot of Shiite Islam. He has been backed militarily by Russia and by Shiite fighters from Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah group in Syrias six-year-old conflict. Assad has the military advantage over rebels in the west thanks to Russias intervention in 2015 although the insurgents are still fighting back and have made gains in some areas.,arabiya,against,0.013513513999999999,1.0,0.313513514,0.005405405,0.005405405,0.010810811000000002,0.045945945999999994,0.032432432000000004,0.573589881,1

Militants have launched fresh rounds of attacks on civilians and security forces across Syria killing at least 12 and injuring a number of others. The Lebanon-based al-Mayadeen TV said that rounds of shelling by militants on two residential neighborhoods in the northern city of Aleppo left 11 people dead including women and children. The report said the rocket attacks targeted al-Neel Street and the New Aleppo neighborhood saying fatalities came mainly due to the destruction of houses in those areas. Syrias official SANA agency said rocket shells also fell in al-Hamadaniyeh neighborhood of Aleppo inflicting losses on private and public properties. It said the attacks were carried out by al-Qaeda-linked Jabhat al-Nusra and other armed groups operating inside and near Aleppo. SANA said militants from Nusra and the so-called Ahrar al-Sham group also launched rounds of mortar attacks on al-Sqeilbiyeh city and al-Jaberiyeh village in Hama province again in north Syria killing one civilian and injuring four others. It said four of the shells hit residential neighborhoods while the other 10 fell in the surroundings of the cities and villages located in the northwestern countryside of Hama. The attacks came one day after four residential neighborhoods of Aleppo and two in and around the capital Damascus were targeted by militants leading to four deaths. Syrian officials say the attacks show lack of seriousness in the opposition to respect a truce deal which is currently holding in the Arab country. The ceasefire which was brokered by the United States and Russia in late February was meant to facilitate and ongoing peace talks in Switzerland between the government and the foreign-backed opposition. The deal excludes al-Nusra Front and Daesh. Damascus and militant groups involved in the ceasefire have been trading accusations of truce violation.

Tags White Helmets SARC war crimes UN aid convoy Urum al-Kubra Aleppo Russian and regime warplanes were behind the ""deliberate attacks"" that targeted a UN-Red Crescent [SARC] convoy on Monday night killing scores of volunteers and civilians the Syrian Civil Defence confirmed in a statement late on Tuesday. The planes struck the convoy as trucks unloaded aid in the town of Urum al-Kubra west of Aleppo city then struck again as Civil Defence crews arrived on the scene the statement added. Fifteen SARC volunteers were killed in the ""double-tap"" strike said the Civil Defence also known as the White Helmets who were among the first responders and more than 25 were injured. The strikes also destroyed most of the aid. The statement described the attack as a crime insisting the whereabouts of the convoy were known to all parties. Earlier the UN decided to suspend all aid convoys in Syria pending the re-evaluation of the security situation following the attack on the convoy in Urum al-Kubra. Reuters quoting US officials said on Tuesday that two Russian Sukhoi SU-24 warplanes were in the skies above an aid convoy in Syria at the precise time it was struck on Monday. The officials were citing US intelligence that has led them to conclude Russia was to blame. According to a CNN report the US has reached the preliminary conclusion that Russian warplanes bombed an aid convoy and warehouse belonging to SARC. ""All the evidence we have points to that conclusion"" one of the officials said. The White House meanwhile said that Russia holds responsibility for the strike regardless of whether it was their planes that attacked. ""All of our information indicates clearly that this was an airstrike. That means there only could have been two entities responsible"" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said on Tuesday night naming Moscow and the Syrian regime. He didnt specify which countrys planes carried out the strike. ""We hold the Russian government responsible for airstrikes in this airspace given their commitment under the cessation of hostilities was to ground air operations where humanitarian assistance was flowing"" Rhodes said referring to the terms of a recent ceasefire brokered between the US and Russia. Russia has denied its aircraft or those of its Syrian government allies were involved in the incident in which 18 trucks from a 31-vehicle convoy were destroyed. The strike appeared to deal a fatal blow to Syrias fragile week-old ceasefire.

On Sunday regime planes killed 31 jihadists and eight civilians in an unprecedented wave of aerial bombardment against the group in its Raqa bastion. The bombing continued on Monday according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights with at least 14 raids against jihadist positions. There was no immediate death toll in the renewed bombing. Three raids targeted the area around the town of Tabqa in western Raqa and four hit near the Tabqa military airport the only remaining regime-held position in the province. The other seven strikes hit sites inside Raqa city the provincial capital. The raids involved the use of precision weapons rather than the explosive-packed barrel bombs that the regime has deployed to deadly effect in Aleppo province and elsewhere. Barrel bombs have been criticised for being indiscriminate and killing civilians. The Syrian raids come as the United States carries out air strikes against the Islamic State just across the border in neighbouring Iraq. The US strikes are intended to limit the advance of IS militants who have seized large swathes of territory in both Iraq and Syria declaring an Islamic ""caliphate.""

1915433682,IS video shows murder of 2 Syrian activists,6 July 2015 So called Islamic State group has posted online a new disturbing video showing the murder of two Syrian activists after they confess to spying. Tags Syria Islamic State activists murder video Palmyra The Islamic State group has released a new video purporting to show the killing of two Syrian activists in the militants stronghold of Raqqa allegedly for spying on the extremists. IS has killed hundreds of people since it declared an Islamic caliphate in June last year with the city of Raqqa as its de facto capital. The video which was posted Monday on an IS-linked Facebook page shows two young men in orange jumpsuits who say they filmed and photographed IS-held areas in Syria and sent footage to a person abroad. They identify themselves as 21-year-old Faysal Hussein Habibi and 20-year-old Bishr Abdul-Azim. They are then tied to a tree after which masked gunmen shoot them in the head at close range. This follows the release of a video posted online n 4 July purportedly showing Islamic State fighters killing 25 Syrian soldiers in the historic town of Palmyra in central Syria. 	 	Scores of Syrian troops and state employees were killed in the days after Palmyra fell to IS. The video showed the soldiers being taken in pickup trucks from the towns notorious Tadmur prison to the amphitheatre. At the theatre they were shot dead by young IS members armed with pistols. Hundreds of people were seen watching the killings. The video did not indicate when the killings took place. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said these shootings took place on 27 May. It was reported in May that scores of Syrian troops and state employees were murdered in the days after the town fell to IS on 22 May 2015. Palmyra is a UNESCO world heritage site famous for its 2000-year-old Roman colonnades other ruins and priceless artifacts. The capture of Palmyra has raised concern that the militants might try to destroy one of the Middle Easts most spectacular archaeological sites a well-preserved Roman-era city on the towns edge as they have destroyed other pre-Islamic ancient monuments elsewhere in Syria and Iraq. On 2 July IS said its militants had destroyed six archaeological pieces from Palmyra that were confiscated from a smuggler. The shootings in the video took place inside the archaeological site and the troops some of whom had bruises and blood on their faces apparently as a result of being beaten were made to kneel in front of a giant IS black flag before being shot in the back of their heads.,alaraby,against,0.02919708,1.0,0.328467153,0.003649635,0.0,0.01459854,0.05839416099999999,0.03649635,0.168369983,0

Abdah also said that this complete inaction towards Assads atrocities represents a bias in favor of a serial killer and a war criminal. At least 13 civilians mostly women and children were killed and over 30 others were wounded on Saturday when regime forces bombed a popular market in the District of Douma in Rural Damascus with heavy artillery. The Assad regimes air force continues to relentlessly hit residential areas in the Aleppo neighborhoods of Tariq al-Bab Bustan al-Qasr Salahaddin al-Mashhad al-Amiriyah Baidin al-Jandoul and Bani Zeid. No figure of the casualties resulted has been released by civil defense teams as they are still recovering victims from under the rubble.

1924058147,At least 126 dead in blast targeting evacuation convoy stranded near Aleppo,"Published April 15 2017 At least 126 people including 68 children were killed Saturday in a suicide car bomb attack on buses carrying Syrians evacuated from two besieged regime-held towns a monitoring group said Sunday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that 98 evacuees from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya were killed when an explosives-laden vehicle hit their buses at a transit point west of Aleppo on Saturday. The dead included 109 evacuees 13 of whom were women from the villages of Foua and Kefraya in the north-western province of Idlib the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The other fatalities were escorts and fighters who were on the site of the bombing outside the northern city of Aleppo according to the Britain-based watchdog. The toll is expected to rise because there are still critically injured and missing people after the blast the Observatory said. The blast hit the Rashidin area on Aleppos outskirts where dozens of buses carrying mostly Shiiite residents of two villages al-Foua and Kefraya that are being evacuated in a deal between warring sides were waiting to enter the city. The state TV channel said the explosion was caused by a car bomb. State TV showed horrific images of bodies strewn on the ground and near buses. A senior opposition official said 20 fighters who guarded the buses were killed as well as dozens of passengers. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media. A military media unit run by Damascus ally Hezbollah said a suicide attacker had detonated a car bomb near the convoy. Pictures posted on state media showed what appeared to be the aftermath of the explosion with bodies lying on the ground and fires belching out thick black plumes of smoke. Buses were blackened by the blast with their windows blown out. Thousands of Syrians were stuck in and around Aleppo on Saturday as a deal to evacuate people from two Shiite villages in return for Sunni opposition fighters and their families leaving two besieged towns near Damascus halted a war monitor and activists said. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said the delay was because opposition groups from Zabadani one of the towns included in the deal had not yet been granted safe passage out. The agreement is one of several concluded in recent months that has seen Bashar al-Assads regime take back control of areas long besieged by his forces and their allies. In the latest deal hundreds of rebels and their families evacuated the town of Madaya near Damascus and were taken to the regime-held city of Aleppo. From there they will travel to Idlib province an opposition stronghold. In return pro-regime fighters and residents from the Shiite villages of al-Foua and Kefraya both surrounded by Idlib opposition fighters have left the area and reached Aleppos outskirts. On Saturday those from Madaya sat outside rows of coaches in a bus garage in government-held Aleppo waiting to move onto Idlib pictures sent by a pro-opposition activist showed. Meanwhile residents from the Shiite villages were still waiting in insurgent territory on Aleppos outskirts to cross into the city the Observatory and a witness said. The pro-opposition activist said opposition fighters were saying that a smaller number of pro-regime fighters had left the Shiite villages than was agreed. A Madaya resident speaking from the bus garage in Aleppo said people had been waiting there since late on Friday night and were not being allowed to leave. ""Theres no drinking water or food. The bus garage is small so theres not much space to move around"" Ahmed 24 said. ""Were sad and angry about what has happened"" he said. Many people felt that they had been forced to leave he said. ""There was no other choice in the end - we were besieged inside a small area in Madaya."" Syrias opposition says the evacuation deals which have included areas of Aleppo and a district in the western city of Homs amount to forced displacement of Assads opponents from Syrias main urban centers. The agreements are also causing demographic changes they say because those who are displaced are mostly Sunni Muslims. Syrias population is mostly Sunni. Assad is from the Alawite religious minority often considered an offshoot of Shiite Islam. He has been backed militarily by Russia and by Shiite fighters from Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah group in Syrias six-year-old conflict. Assad holds the military advantage over the opposition in the west of the country thanks to Russias intervention in 2015 although the insurgents continue to fight back and have made gains in some areas.",dailysabah,against,0.010245902,1.0,0.290983607,0.00204918,0.004098361,0.010245902,0.055327869,0.049180327999999995,5.043260318,1

The activists said some corpses were even beyond recognition. The bombs were dropped on a camp near al-Habeet in the northern province of Idlib on Wednesday killing mostly women and children at the camp. Footage posted on YouTube showed corpses of women and children and burning tents while people scrambled to save the wounded. ""Its a massacre of refugees"" a voice off camera said. ""Let the whole world see this they are displaced people. Look at them. They are civilians displaced civilians"" he said. The U.S. said it was ""horrified"" by the reports of the bombing adding that it could not confirm details. ""The attack on the Abedin camp was nothing short of barbaric"" said state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki. ""Unfortunately if it is confirmed to be the work of the [Assad] regime it is only the latest act of brutality by the regime against its own people."" Camp residents told Reuters that the attack took place on Wednesday with two barrel bombs dropped from an army helicopter. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also confirmed that the Assad regime carried out the air attack on the camp. U.S. officials acknowledged Wednesday that the solution to the crisis in Syria would ultimately require Assads removal even though coalition operations do not target his regime. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said the solution in Syria will ""ultimately have to result in Assads departure."" She added ""You have an illegitimate and exceedingly violent leadership that has created conditions not only that have been so harmful to the population but have made it a very attractive magnet for terrorists"" while speaking at the Harman Center for the Arts based in Washington. Rices deputy Tony Blinken speaking at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said that the train and equip program that the coalition will sponsor for moderate Syrian opposition fighters will also fight the Assad regime. Responding to a question as to why airstrikes do not target Assad forces that drop barrel bombs on civilians Blinken said the strategic plan of the coalition is to ultimately destroy the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). Blinken said the challenge for keeping the coalition is to deal with the different agendas that each country has. Blinken added in the end that the ""glue holding them together"" is ISISs violence. The war in Syria which started in March 2011 with pro-democracy protests but rapidly grew into a horrific civil war has caused the death of more than 200000 people and at least 60000 are missing.

The Al Fawwar camp in Syrias southwestern Quneitra province is used by the National Defence Forces (NDF) which command some 90000 fighters across Syria. The NDF official told AFP that two fighters were also wounded in the Israeli attack but said it was unclear whether the damage was inflicted by an air strike or shelling. Another Syrian source inside the training camp told AFP that around 600am local time (0300 GMT) ""security guards at the camp saw what looked like three fireballs coming towards the camp"". ""Then there were several consecutive blasts because of the explosion of ammunition warehouses"" that firefighters worked hard to extinguish the source said. The source also said that they were ""Israeli rockets"" but could not specify what kind of missiles may have been used. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said the attack had targeted a ""weapons warehouse"" in the camp. Israels army declined to comment Sunday on the attack. On Friday the Israeli army said it targeted positions inside Syria in retaliation for mortar fire that hit the northern part of the Golan Heights. At the time Syrias official news agency SANA said Israel had struck a Syrian army position in the province of Quneitra on the Golan plateau ""causing damage"". The Syrian government labels rebel groups and militants fighting the regime as ""terrorists"" and accuses Israel of backing them.

1924058037,Five dead as Russian military helicopter downed in Syria | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Aug 012016 BEIRUT A Russian military helicopter was shot down over Syria on Monday killing all five people on board in the single deadliest incident for Moscow since it intervened in the war. The attack came as Syrian opposition fighters and their allies battled government forces outside Aleppo in a bid to ease the regimes siege of rebel-held parts of the northern city. Russias defence ministry announced the downing of the helicopter which it said was carrying three crew and two officers. ""A Russian Mi-8 military transport helicopter was shot down from the ground after delivering humanitarian aid to Aleppo"" the defence ministry said in a statement quoted by Russian news agencies. The Kremlin said all five people on board were assumed dead. ""As far as we know from the information weve had from the defence ministry those in the helicopter died they died heroically because they were trying to move the aircraft away to minimise victims on the ground"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. Lieutenant General Sergei Rudskoy called the downing a ""terrorist act"" and said the defence ministry was still trying to confirm the fate of the Russian servicemen ""through all possible channels"". It was not immediately clear who was responsible. The incident was the deadliest single attack on Russian forces in Syria since Moscow began its intervention in support of President Bashar Assads government last September. It brought the total number of members of the Russian forces killed in Syria to 18. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitor said the helicopter had come down along the administrative border between Idlib province in the northwest and neighbouring Aleppo. Idlib is held almost entirely by a powerful coalition of Islamist and jihadist forces including the former Al Nusra Front now known as the Fateh Al Sham Front after renouncing its status as Al Qaedas Syrian affiliate. Aleppo rebel assault In neighbouring Aleppo province the Fateh Al Sham Front and allied rebel groups were fighting fierce battles on Monday against regime troops on the outskirts of Aleppo city. The clashes are part of an assault launched Sunday to try to ease a government siege of the rebel-held east of the city. The observatory said the rebels had advanced overnight south and southwest of Aleppo but reported ongoing fighting as well as government air strikes on the battlefield and rebel-held eastern neighbourhoods. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo city has been roughly divided between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012. In recent weeks government forces have encircled the east cutting the sole supply route in and raising fears of a humanitarian crisis for the estimated 250000 people now under siege there. The primary goal of the rebel assault is to seize the Ramussa neighbourhood on the citys southern outskirts. The road that runs through Ramussa is the main supply route for regime forces going to the areas they control in western Aleppo said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. It is also used by civilians to enter and leave government-controlled districts of Aleppo. Taking a detour from the north would be too dangerous he added. Islamist group Ahrar Al Sham said on Twitter it was involved in fierce clashes near Ramussa and advancing towards the route. State news agency SANA said rebel rocket and sniper fire near Ramussa on Monday killed four people including three women. The observatory put the toll at six dead. Humanitarian corridors SANA said people were using the route as usual but residents of western Aleppo expressed fears that the assault could cut them off. If the militants break the siege they will besiege us and cut the Khanasser route which is the only artery we have said Hossam Qassab a 32-year-old pharmacist. A Syrian security source acknowledged the assault but said government forces had repelled it. The encirclement of eastern Aleppo has raised fears of starvation for remaining residents who have reported food shortages and spiralling prices since the government siege began on July 17. Last week Moscow announced the opening of humanitarian corridors from the east into government territory for civilians and surrendering rebels. On Saturday Moscow and Syrian official media reported dozens of civilians had fled via these corridors but residents and rebels on the ground dismissed the reports as lies.

Airstrikes by US-led coalition fighter jets have killed at least 21 civilians in northern Syrian territories held by the Daesh (ISIS ISIL) Takfiri terrorists a monitoring group says. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Monday that at least 15 people were killed as the coalition carried out raids in a northern district of Manbij city. The UK-based group which advocates the Syrian opposition said six more people lost their lives in a village near Manbij after similar attacks by coalition fighter jets. The so-called multinational task force against ISIS started its controversial mission in Iraq in late 2014 after ISIS seized control over territories west and north of the country. The air campaign was later expanded to cover areas in northern Syria despite criticism from the Syrian government that the attacks violate the sovereignty of the Arab country. The United States claims the attacks are carried out to assist Syrian Kurds and Arabs fighting against ISIS in areas along the Turkish border in the province of Aleppo. However the attacks have led to numerous deaths among the civilians and Syrian military forces. The coalition attacks on Manbij intensified in late June after Kurds and Arabs from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance failed in their drive to fully push back militants from the city. The SDF has attempted several times to advance from the western neighborhoods it has captured into the road south of Manbij which connects the strategic city to Raqqa the de facto capital of ISIS in Syria.

1923102891,Students among scores dead as raids hit Syria school,"Date of publication 26 October 2016 Warplanes either Russia or Syrian carried out six strikes in the village of Hass including on a school complex a monitor has said. Airstrikes on Syrias rebel-held Idlib province hit a school and the surrounding area on Wednesday killing at least 26 civilians including many children a monitor and activists said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said ""warplanes either Russia or Syrian carried out six strikes"" in the village of Hass including on a school complex. The Britain-based Observatory which monitors Syrias five-year conflict said at least 11 children were among the 26 civilians killed. A complex of 3 schools was targeted in by many airstrikes including a double tap. Initial reports of 20+ killed & many injured. The White Helmets civil defence group released pictures of four rescue workers clambering over a mound of rubble in search of survivors after what it said was a ""double-tap"" strike on the school. The raids hit Hass around 1130 am (0830 GMT) an activist with the opposition Idlib Media Centre told AFP. ""One rocket hit the entrance of the school as students were leaving to go home after the school administration decided to end classes for the day because of the raids"" the activist said speaking on condition of anonymity. Other activists from the province circulated a photograph on social media of a childs arm seared off above the elbow still clutching the strap of a dusty black rucksack. Shaky video footage depicted rescue workers sprinting towards the site of the raids and pulling a frail elderly man out of a collapsed building. The authenticity of the pictures and footage could not be independently verified. Syrian government forces and their Russian ally have been criticised by rights groups for indiscriminate attacks on civilian infrastructure. Intentional attack A leading opposition group condemned the raids. The Istanbul-based National Coalition said Russian and regime warplanes ""targeted children in their schools deliberately and intentionally hitting civilians with high-explosive material."" Idlib province is controlled by the Army of Conquest an alliance of rebel groups and extremists including the Fateh al-Sham Front which changed its name from al-Nusra Front after breaking off ties with al-Qaeda earlier this year. Syrian and Russian warplanes regularly bomb Idlib but airstrikes have intensified in recent weeks according to the Observatory. Seven days of airstrikes across the northwestern province had left more than 75 civilians dead and another 150 wounded it said. Syrias conflict erupted in March 2011 with protests calling for the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad. But it has since evolved into a multi-front war pitting extremists rebels government forces and Kurdish militia against each other. More than 300000 people have been killed and millions forced to flee their homes.

1924058191,Aleppo airstrikes kill 36 people in opposition-held areas,"Published October 17 2016 Airstrikes on opposition-held areas in the northern province of Aleppo Monday killed at least 36 people including children opposition activists said as violence in Syria continued while a major operation began against Daesh in neighboring Iraq. Most of the deaths were in the village of Oweijel just west of the city of Aleppo where at least 23 people were killed in an airstrike that also wounded dozens according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Another monitoring group the Local Coordination Committees said the air raid was carried out by Russian warplanes and put the death toll at 30. More than a dozen people were also killed in a besieged eastern opposition-held neighborhood in Aleppo. The eastern parts of the city Syrias largest have been subjected in recent weeks to the worst aerial attacks in years. The airstrikes have claimed hundreds of lives wounded many others and demolished entire buildings. Opposition activists have blamed Russian and Syrian government warplanes for the strikes. The Observatory said Mondays airstrikes hit in the Marjeh neighborhood. The Aleppo Media Center an activist collective said those killed included 11 people with the same family name of Qabs ranging from a month-and-a-half-old baby girl to a 25-year-old man. Mondays airstrikes coincided with the launch in neighboring Iraq of a major operation by Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by the U.S.-led coalition to retake the city of Mosul from Daesh. There have been concerns the government in Damascus could use the timing of the Mosul offensive to press its onslaught in Aleppo while world attention is diverted to developments in Iraq. Also Monday Syrian state media claimed 49 oppostion fighters were killed and wounded in fighting in the neighborhoods of Sheikh Saeed and Shurfa on the southern edges of Aleppo. In the nearby province of Idlib a U.S.-led coalition drone struck a car in the provincial capital that carries the same name killing all inside according to the Observatory official. It was not immediately clear who was in the vehicle but such attacks have previously targeted officials with al-Qaidas affiliate in Syria known as Fatah al-Sham Front. The Observatory said the attack targeted a faction commander. An official with Fatah al-Sham Front formerly known as Nusra Front said all those in the car were ""martyred."" The man who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media said it was not clear if members of his group were targeted. Earlier this month a drone attack killed top al-Qaida official Ahmed Salama Mabrouk. The United States and Britain on Sunday acknowledged the Western worlds weak support for any military action against Syrias government as they seek ways to pressure Syrian regime leader Bashar Assad and his chief backer Russia to halt the deadly Aleppo offensive. After a meeting of 11 governments opposing Assads rule U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson each insisted that all options were on the table. But their stark explanations about the danger of resorting to military force appeared to rule out such a move. The government in Damascus meanwhile appears to be trying to improve relations with Egypt the Arab worlds most populous nation following the first public meeting between Egyptian and Syrian security chiefs. Maj. Gen. Ali Mamlouk head of the National Security Bureau and one of Assads top aides visited Cairo Sunday at the head of a delegation to coordinate with Egypt in the fight against ""terrorism"" in the region Syrias state-run news agency SANA said. SANA said the Syrians met with top intelligence officials including deputy chief of Egypts intelligence agency. It said both sides agreed on ""coordinating political standpoints"" and strengthening the ""cooperation in fighting terrorism."" Egypts pro-government Sada al-Balad and other news websites reported on Sunday that six Syrians arrived on a private jet from Damascus. Earlier this month Egypt voted for rival French and Russian draft resolutions on Syria at the U.N.

Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests which erupted as part of the Arab Spring uprisings with unexpected ferocity and disproportionate force. Russia first began its air campaign in Syria on Sept. 30 of last year. While Russia claims its campaign is aimed primarily at the DAESH terrorist group it has repeatedly targeted civilian areas and the moderate anti-regime opposition groups that control them. Since then more than a quarter of a million people have been killed and more than 10 million displaced throughout the war-battered country according to the U.N. The Syrian Center for Policy Research a nongovernmental organization however has put the death toll from the five-year conflict at as high as 470000.

""The Syrian regime is responsible for 99 percent of deaths due to torture at detention centers"" the statement added which was issued to mark the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture. SNHR Director Fadl Abdel-Ghani said his group could not document any case of detention with a legal warrant.

He said more than 20000 of them had died at Sednaya prison near Damascus. The observatory said it had been able to verify the deaths of 14456 people 110 of them under the age of 18 since the start of the Syrian uprising in 2011.

U.N. inspectors will go to Syria to investigate three sites where chemical weapons attacks have been reported the United Nations said Wednesday. The Syrian government has blocked the inspectors since calling for a U.N. inquiry into the use of the banned arms in March. The mission will travel to Syria as soon as possible to contemporaneously investigate three of the reported incidents said U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky. The announcement followed an accord reached with the Syrian government when two U.N. envoys went to Damascus last week. According to diplomats the inspectors are being assembled in Europe now and could go to Syria as soon as next week. The U.N. says that Syria Britain France and the United States have informed it of 13 alleged chemical weapons attacks during the 28-month-old conflict. While the initial inquiry will focus on three sites Nesirky said U.N. leader Ban Ki-moon remains mindful of other reported incidents and the mission will also continue to seek clarification from the member states concerned. The spokesman said the first sites to be visited will include Khan al-Assal near the Syrian city of Aleppo where the government reported a chemical weapons attack on March 19. It said at least 26 people including 16 government soldiers were killed. The government and its ally Russia have blamed Syrian rebels for the attack. The Syrian opposition says President Bashar al-Assads forces staged the attack. The other two sites to be visited by the inspectors are Ataybah near Damascus where a suspected attack was staged in March and Homs where chemical weapons are alleged to have been used on December 23 diplomats said. Britain and France have submitted evidence to the United Nations on the Ataybah and Homs attacks which they say was carried out by the government.

Airstrikes by the Assad regime and Russia air forces earlier on Wednesday hit a schools complex and a public market in the town of Hass in rural Idlib killing at least 26 civilians and wounding dozens more mostly schoolchildren and teachers. High-explosive parachute-retarded bombs were used in the airstrikes launched in a joint attack by the Assad regime and Russian air forces. The Syrian Coalition condemned this heinous crime against schoolchildren and civilians. In a statement released following the attack the Coalition stressed that the deliberate targeting of civilians using high-explosive weapons is clearly aimed at killing as many people as possible; causing mayhem; forcing civilians to leave their homes; and forcing them to agree to local truces out of the framework of the political process. Responsibility for this heinous crime lies with the international community as world leaders and active members of the United Nations continue to ignore these war crimes thus risk further fueling the conflict and undermining all chances of a political solution the Coalition added. The Coalition earlier said that the United Nations continues to ignore Russias crimes and its violations of international law urging it to make a thorough and real reconsideration of its positions and performance on Syria after the election of a new secretary-general.

Syrian state TV said an explosive device went off in the northern city of Aleppo killing six people and wounding 30 others. It did not provide further details on Wednesdays blast in the regime-held Salaheddin neighborhood. Opposition media groups including Aleppo Today said the explosion occurred near a mosque during the funeral of a regime fighter. Aleppo was divided between regime and rebel-held districts for years but regime forces managed to drive rebels from the city in December with a Russian-backed offensive. Some contested areas remain. Meanwhile the widely criticized evacuation of thousands of Syrians from four besieged areas resumed Wednesday state media and activists said days after a bombing killed more than 120 evacuees and delayed the population transfer. The Central Military Media said 3000 residents of two pro-regime villages Foua and Kafarya left Wednesday in 45 buses bound for regime-controlled Aleppo. Another 11 buses carrying some 500 people including opposition fighters left Madaya and Zabadani near Damascus heading toward the northern rebel-held Idlib province. The opposition-run Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported the transfer which it said includes 800 armed men from both the rebels and regime. Some 160 mostly gunmen had remained in Zabadani. The process has resumed with 3000 people leaving Foua and Kafraya at dawn and nearly 300 leaving Zabadani and two other rebel-held areas the head of the Britain-based monitoring group Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP. Security was tightened up for Wednesdays departures. Several dozen armed rebel fighters stood guard over the marshalling area where the buses were parked. The AFP correspondent said all other vehicles were carefully searched. After repeated delays the first phase of the deal began on Friday. Some 30 hours after the first two batches reached exchange points a massive explosion struck near buses carrying evacuees from the pro-regime areas killing more than 120 mostly women and children. Many of the rebel fighters who guarded the buses were also killed. No one claimed responsibility for the attack which the regime blamed on the rebels. The transfer deal is not overseen by the United Nations. Critics say the string of evacuations which could see some 30000 people moved across battle lines over the next 60 days rewards siege tactics and amounts to forced displacement along political and sectarian lines. All four areas have been under siege for years their fate linked through a series of reciprocal agreements that the UN says have hindered aid deliveries.

1923848146,Suspected gas attack on Syrias rebel-held Idlib kills at least 58 Observatory,"Tuesday 4 Apr 2017 Suspected gas attack on Syrias rebel-held Idlib kills at least 58 Observatory Reuters A suspected gas attack believed to be by Syrian government jets killed at least 58 people including 11 children under the age of eight in the northwestern province of Idlib on Tuesday a war monitor and medical workers in the rebel-held area said. A Syrian military source strongly denied the army had used any such weapons. The attack caused many people to choke or faint and some had foam coming out of their mouths the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said citing medical sources who described it as a sign of a gas attack. The air strikes on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the south of rebel-held Idlib also wounded more than 60 people said the Observatory a British-based war monitoring group. ""This morning at 630 a.m. warplanes targeted Khan Sheikhoun with gases believed to be sarin and chlorine"" said Mounzer Khalil head of Idlibs health authority adding that the attack had killed more than 50 people and wounded 300. ""Most of the hospitals in Idlib province are now overflowing with wounded people"" he told a news conference in Idlib. Warplanes later struck near a medical point where victims of the attack were being treated the Observatory said and civil defence workers said. The civil defence also known as the White Helmets - a rescue service that operates in opposition areas of Syria - said jets struck one of its centres in the area and the nearby medical point. It would mark the deadliest chemical attack in Syria since sarin gas killed hundreds of civilians in Ghouta near Damascus in August 2013. Western states said the Syrian government was responsible for that attack. Damascus blamed it on rebels. Military Denies The Syrian military source on Tuesday denied allegations that government forces had used chemical weapons dismissing the accounts as rebel propaganda. The army ""has not and does not use them not in the past and not in the future because it does not have them in the first place"" the source said. A joint inquiry for the United Nations and the global chemical weapons watchdog has previously accused government forces of toxic gas attacks. France called for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting about Tuesdays suspected attack. Reuters photographs showed people breathing through oxygen masks and wearing protection suits while others carried the bodies of dead children and corpses wrapped in blankets were lined up on the ground. Activists in northern Syria circulated pictures on social media showing a purported victim with foam around his mouth and rescue workers hosing down almost naked children squirming on the floor. Most of the towns streets had become empty a witness said. The conflict pits President Bashar al-Assads government helped by Russia and Iranian-backed militias against a wide array of rebel groups including some that have been supported by Turkey the United States and Gulf monarchies. The Russian Defence Ministry said on Tuesday that Russian planes had not carried out air strikes on Idlib. Syrian and Russian air strikes have battered parts of Idlib despite a ceasefire that Turkey and Russia brokered in December according to the Observatory. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the suspected attack Turkish presidential sources said. They said the two leaders had also emphasised the importance of maintaining the ceasefire. Population Ballooned Idlib province contains the largest populated area controlled by the anti-Assad rebels - both nationalist Free Syrian Army groups and Islamist factions including the former al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. Idlibs population has ballooned with thousands of fighters and civilians shuttled out of Aleppo city and areas around Damascus that the government has retaken in recent months. U.S. air strikes since January have also hit several areas in the rural province where jihadists have a powerful presence. The United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have been investigating whether Damascus is adhering to its commitments under the 2013 agreement which averted the threat of U.S.-led military intervention. In a report in October last year the inquiry said that government forces used chemical weapons at least three times in 2014-2015 and that Islamic State used mustard gas in 2015. Following the 2013 Ghouta attack the Syrian government joined the international Chemical Weapons Convention under a U.S.-Russian deal. The government which denied its forces were behind the Ghouta attack also agreed to hand over its declared stockpile of 1300 tonnes of toxic weaponry and dismantle its chemical weapons program under international supervision. Damascus has repeatedly denied using such weapons during the six-year war which has killed hundreds of thousands and created the worlds worst refugee crisis.",ahram,against,0.009469697,1.0,0.306818182,0.0018939389999999999,0.0,0.015151515,0.0625,0.043560605999999995,0.8348594890000001,1

Among the dead in the blast in the rebel-controlled town of Namar were a woman and a child the Britain-based monitoring group said. In northern Syria the Observatory reported 10 people killed when regime helicopters dropped explosive-packed ""barrel bombs"" on Aleppo city. The attacks targeted the Bab al-Nairab district of the Old City and the southern Salahin neighbourhood. North of Aleppo city the Observatory said jihadists from the Islamic State (IS) group extended their advances seizing Baghaydin village near the border with Turkey. On Wednesday IS fighters captured eight villages in the area between Aleppo and the border from rival rebel groups. Those advances came after clashes that killed at least 40 fighters from rebel groups as well as 12 IS fighters according to the Observatory. The successes open the way for IS to move towards two strategic prizes - Aazaz and Marea. Marea is a stronghold of the Islamic Front a coalition of Islamist groups that is among those fighting against IS. Aazaz sits next to a border crossing with Turkey which would be a valuable asset as IS seeks to expand its self-declared ""caliphate"" in the territory it holds in Syria and neighbouring Iraq. IS emerged from Al-Qaedas one-time branch in Iraq and initially fought alongside Syrias opposition including more moderate rebels and Al-Nusra fighters. But its abuses and harsh brand of religion prompted a backlash from rebel groups that pushed it out of many opposition-held areas earlier this year. Since then it has staged a comeback bolstered by weaponry obtained in advances across the border in Iraq. One analyst warned Friday that the fate of Syrias ""Western-backed opposition in northern Syria hangs quite literally on a knife-edge"" as IS advances in northern Aleppo and regime forces advance in Aleppo city. In an opinion piece published on CNNs website Charles Lister of the Brookings Doha Centre said Syrias rebels were facing an ""existential threat"". Lister said IS was likely to move into Aazaz cutting rebel supply lines to Syria and into Marea from which it could launch attacks on rebel-held parts of Aleppo city. Aleppo has been divided between rebel control in the east and regime control in the west since shortly after fighting began there in mid-2012. In the face of regime advances around the eastern outskirts of the city coupled with IS advances farther north the remaining rebels inside Aleppo are increasingly beleaguered. Fighting in the province has left civilians there ""living in appalling conditions"" the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Friday. The ICRC said it was working with Syrias Red Crescent to deliver medical aid to all parts of the province in both rebel- and regime-held territory. ""Stepping up aid distributions in the governorate has been the ICRCs priority ever since we established a permanent presence in the city over a year ago"" it said.

The notorious ISIL terrorists have brutally massacred 250 Syrian troops taken hostage at an airbase in the northern province of Raqqa reports indicate. The killings the video of which was published on the internet took place on Wednesday at Tabqa airbase which was overran by the ISIL Takfiri terrorists. Rami Abdel Rahman the head of the London-based so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said on Thursday that Syrian soldiers captured while fleeing after the ISIL terrorists overran Tabqa airbase were executed by the terrorists during the night. The base is located some 45 kilometers outside Raqqa and reportedly holds several planes helicopters tanks and artillery. ISIL militants operating against the Syrian government have committed numerous mass executions during the ongoing conflict. Since the outbreak of crisis in Syria in March 2011 several video clips have been released showing the grisly crimes perpetrated by the Takfiri terrorists against innocent civilians in the crisis-torn country. ISIL terrorists have been behind many of the deadly bomb attacks targeting both civilians and government institutions across Syria over the past three years. The ISIL violence has spilled over to neighboring Iraq. The terrorist group has links with Saudi intelligence and is believed to be indirectly supported by the Israeli regime.

In Jassem in the southern province of Daraa 15 civilians were killed in four air strikes while 25 others were wounded said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The strikes in response to a major rebel offensive that has been underway in southern Syria for months. ""As usual the regime is striking populated areas in order to make civilian supporters of opposition fighters turn against them"" Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. Rebels fighting to oust President Bashar al-Assad have suffered a spate of defeats at the hands of his forces but they still have the upper hand in Daraa. ""Opposition fighters are making steady progress in Daraa province. The vast majority of the west of the province has completely fallen out of government control and that is where Jassem is located"" Abdel Rahman said. Rebel fighters in the area benefit from ""the fact that supply lines from Jordan are still open"" he added. The involvement of experienced fighters of Syrias Al-Qaeda affiliate the Al-Nusra Front has also helped the rebels to gain territory in Daraa. Elsewhere air strikes on Douma the besieged rebel-held town east of Damascus killed at least six civilians and wounded dozens more the Observatory said. An AFP photographer in Douma said the strikes hit residential areas and that most of the wounded were children. At Khan Sheikhun in the northwestern province of Idlib 11 people were killed including a former army officer who had defected from the loyalist army to join opposition forces said the Observatory. The regime first deployed warplanes in the Syrian war in July 2012. Now nearly four years into the conflict there are air strikes every day despite repeated warnings from the international community that such tactics fail to discriminate between civilian and military targets. On a separate front Syrian Kurds fighting the Islamic State group made fresh advances near Kobane seizing a new string of villages a week after the flashpoint town was recaptured from the IS jihadists. ""The Kurds now control an area stretching across 14 kilometres (nine miles) southwards from Kobane 10 kilometres to the east and 10 to 12 kilometres to the west"" said Abdel Rahman. The Observatory director also said Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) backed by Syrian rebels killed 10 IS members in the past 24 hours.

1965495324,Syria Accuses Rebels of Using Chemical Weapons,"24.08.2013 Syrian state media accused rebels of using chemical arms on Saturday against government troops trying to storm a contested neighborhood of Damascus claiming a major army offensive in recent days had forced the opposition fighters to resort to such weapons ""as their last card."" DAMASCUS Syria (The Associated Press Albert Aji) Syrian state media accused rebels of using chemical arms on Saturday against government troops trying to storm a contested neighborhood of Damascus claiming a major army offensive in recent days had forced the opposition fighters to resort to such weapons ""as their last card."" State TV broadcast images of plastic jugs gas masks vials of an unspecified medication explosives and other items that it said were seized from rebel hideouts. It did not however show any video of soldiers reportedly affected by toxic gas in the fighting in the Jobar neighborhood of Damascus. Still the claims could muddy the debate about who was responsible for an alleged gas attack on rebel-held suburbs of the capital on Wednesday that activists say killed more than 130 people. That attack has spurred demands for an independent investigation and renewed talk of potential international military action if chemical weapons were indeed used. Just hours before the state media reports the UN disarmament chief arrived in Damascus to press President Bashar Assads regime to allow UN experts to investigate Wednesdays alleged attack. The Assad regime has denied allegations that it was behind that attack calling them ""absolutely baseless"" and suggesting they are an attempt to discredit the government. The US Britain France and Russia have urged the Assad regime and the rebels fighting to overthrow him to cooperate with the United Nations and allow a team of experts already in Syria to look into the latest purported use of chemical agents. The UN secretary-general dispatched Angela Kane the high representative for disarmament affairs to push for a speedy investigation into Wednesdays purported attack. She did not speak to reporters upon her arrival in Damascus Saturday. With the pressure increasing on the regime to comply Syrias state media alleged on Saturday that rebels in the contested district of Jobar had used chemical weapons against government troops advancing into the area. The state news agency said several government troops who took part in an offensive experienced severe trouble breathing or even ""suffocation"" after ""armed terrorist groups used chemical weapons."" It was not clear what was meant by ""suffocation"" and the report mentioned no fatalities among the troops. The government refers to rebels fighting to topple Assad as ""terrorists."" ""The Syrian Army achieved major progress in the past days and for that reason the terrorist groups used chemical weapons as their last card"" the Syrian state TV said. That report was followed by an unusual string of breaking alerts on the TVs news scroll that made a series of claims related to the alleged use of chemical arms by rebels in the Jobar neighborhood. One message cited a Syrian TV journalist who is embedded with the troops in the district who said the army confiscated an arms cache that included gas masks and several barrels with ""made in Saudi Arabia"" stamped on them. It did not say what was in the barrels but appeared to suggest that some sort of chemical agent was inside and supplied by Saudi Arabia the regions Sunni Muslim power and a staunch supporter of Syrias Sunni-led revolt. Another news scroll said that troops after overrunning rebel positions discovered antidotes following exposure to chemical agents. The TV said the medicines were produced by a Qatari-German medical supplies company. Qatar is another strong supporter of the Syrian rebels. The report could not be immediately verified. For days the government has been trying to counter rebel allegations that the regime used chemical weapons on civilians in rebel-held areas of eastern Damascus arguing that opposition fighters themselves were responsible for that attack. On Saturday French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said dismissed the government line. ""All the information we have is converging to indicate there was a chemical massacre in Syria near Damascus and that Bashar Assads regime was behind it"" Fabius told reporters during a visit to the West Bank city of Ramallah. He did not elaborate. France has suggested that force could be used against Syria if Assads regime was proven to have used chemical arms. The new talk of potential military action in Syria has made an independent investigation by UN inspectors critical to determine what exactly transpired. The UN experts already in Syria are tasked with investigating three earlier purported chemical attacks in the country one in the village of Khan al-Assal outside the northern city of Aleppo in March as well as two other locations that have been kept secret for security reasons. It took months of negotiations between the UN and Damascus before an agreement was struck to allow the 20-member team into Syria to investigate. Its mandate is limited to those three sites however and it is only charged with determining whether chemical weapons were used not who used them. Syrias Deputy Prime Minister Qadri Jamil told The Associated Press on Thursday that he was personally in favor of a fair transparent international delegation to investigate the latest incident. But he said that would require a new agreement between the government and the United Nations and that the conditions for such a delegation would need to be studied. ... 11 Tags Bashar al-Assad chemical weapons Angela Kane Damascus Community standardsDiscussion Comment via FacebookComment via Sputnik News",sputnik,pro,0.008237231999999999,1.0,0.301482702,0.0,0.008237231999999999,0.021416803999999998,0.074135091,0.05601318,0.097322006,1

Rebel groups including the powerful Ahrar al-Sham faction and former Al-Qaeda affiliate Fateh al-Sham Front fired waves of rockets into government-held western Aleppo killing at least 15 civilians a monitor said. The rebels also targeted government positions east of Aleppo city and in the coastal province of Latakia including the Hmeimim military base used by Russian forces allied with the regime. Moscow says it has not bombed Aleppo since October 18 but senior Russian military official Sergei Rudskoi told a briefing Friday that the military had asked President Vladimir Putin for authorisation to resume its air strikes. ""We have appealed to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation with a request to resume air strikes"" Rudskoi said. But the Kremlin said Putin did not agree. ""The Russian president considers it inappropriate at the current moment to resume strikes on Aleppo"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said adding that Putin thought it was necessary to ""continue the humanitarian pause"" in the war-ravaged city. ""The Russian side retains the right in case of extreme necessity to use all the troops and facilities it has to carry out support of the Syrian armed forces at the necessary level"" he added. Fridays rebel assault comes more than three months into a government siege of eastern Aleppo where more than 250000 people live and several weeks after the army began an operation to retake the rebel east. Rebel groups ""announce the start of the battle to break the siege of Aleppo"" said Abu Yusef Muhajir a military commander and spokesman for Ahrar al-Sham. The assault ""will end the regime occupation of western Aleppo and break the siege on the people trapped inside"" he told AFP. ""The breaking of the siege is inevitable"" said Yasser al-Yusef a member of the political office of the Nureddine al-Zinki rebel group. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitor said at least 15 civilians including a woman and two children had been killed and more than 100 wounded in rebel fire on western Aleppo. The monitor reported fierce clashes on multiple fronts on the western and southern outskirts of west Aleppo with three suicide car bombs targeting a checkpoint in the Dahiyet al-Assad neighbourhood. Fighting was continuing in the area near a military academy it said but had no immediate toll. An AFP correspondent in east Aleppo said the assault had boosted morale in rebel-held districts with mosques broadcasting ""God is greatest"" from loudspeakers. He said residents burned tyres to create smoke and provide cover against air attack. Heavy rain put the fires out but also hampered Syrian air operations creating what one rebel dubbed ""a divine no-fly zone"". The Observatory said rebels had also fired dozens of rockets at the Nairab military airport and Aleppo international airport both east of the city and government-controlled. Rebels also fired rockets from Idlib province into the government stronghold of Latakia killing one person and wounding six. Rockets struck close to the Hmeimim military airport as well as near President Bashar al-Assads ancestral village Qardaha the monitor said. State television said ""the army has foiled an attempt by terrorists to attack Aleppo city from several axes with suicide bomb attacks and has inflicted losses on them"". State news agency SANA said government planes were carrying out air strikes south and west of Aleppo. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo has been ravaged by the conflict that began in March 2011 with anti-government protests and has since killed more than 300000 people. Aleppo has been divided between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012 and in September the army announced an operation to recapture the whole city. The UNs aid chief Stephen OBrien this week said Aleppo had become ""a kill zone"" adding that ""nothing is actually happening to stop the war stop the suffering"". Last week Russia implemented a three-day ""humanitarian truce"" intended to allow civilians and surrendering rebels to leave the east. But few did so and a UN plan to evacuate the wounded failed because security could not be guaranteed. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused UN agencies Friday of ""not being professional enough"" over Aleppo. Speaking in Moscow after meeting the Syrian and Iranian foreign ministers he said ""Their inaction allowed the medical evacuation to be sabotaged.""

The monitoring group updated its earlier death toll of 15 for the strike on Urum al-Joz saying three more people had died of serious injuries. It said the strike was believed to have been carried out by Russian planes which operate in support of the Assad regime. The Observatory which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. Idlib province is controlled by an opposition alliance and is regularly targeted by both the Assad regime and its Russian ally. Earlier this week a chemical attack hit the town of Khan Sheikhun in Idlib killing at least 87 civilians including 31 children.

1962495643,Hundreds killed as Street Battles Rages in Kobni,"Tue Oct 7 2014 Hundreds killed as Street Battles Rages in Kobni. Kurdish militia fought fierce street battles Tuesday with advancing ISIS Terrorists whose three-week assault on a key Syrian border town has left hundreds reported dead. The fall of Kobane to the ISIS group would mark a major victory for the Terrorists who are fighting for a long stretch of the border with Turkey for their self-proclaimed ""Islamic caliphate"". At least 412 people more than half of them from ISIS have been killed in and around Kobane since mid-September the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. It warned that the inaccessibility of the area meant that the full toll was probably much higher. With the fight for Kobane entering a crucial phase the IS militants fought to extend their foothold into new areas in the south and west of the town a day after piercing its Kurdish defenses. Gunfire explosions and the roar of fighter jets were heard from the Turkish side of the border while a Kurdish flag was seen flying in the centre of Kobane according to an AFP journalist. The IS Terrorists ""are trying hard to capture the city"" said Idris Nahsen a Kurdish official still in Kobane also known as Ain al-Arab. He said they were meeting resistance from the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units. ""We need help from the international community"" Nahsen told AFP by telephone. ""Either we finish them (IS) or they will finish us."" IS fighters have seized a number of buildings in south and west Kobane including a hospital under construction according to the Observatory a Britain-based monitoring group. Kurdish fighters have ordered civilians to evacuate the town after the Terrorists planted their black flags on its eastern side and entered Kobane on Monday. In Iraq meanwhile at least 17 people were reported killed when a suicide bomber attacked an observation post used by Shiite militiamen watching for IS fighters crossing the Tigris River late Monday. The United States and its allies have launched nearly 2000 air raids against ISIS in both Iraq and Syria in an attempt to stop their advance including four strikes in Kobane on Tuesday. The Kurdish fighters are optimistic that their local knowledge of Kobane will compensate for their light weapons said activist Mustafa Ebdi. ""They are fighting to defend their town and they say they will fight to the last person"" he said.Ebdi added the latest US air raids had little effect.

Tags Syria Raqqa airstrikes US-led coalition Kurds Islamic State group A US-led coalition airstrike killed at least 18 civilians on Tuesday in the Islamic State groups former stronghold of Raqqa the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said. ""International coalition planes targeted water wells where a group of civilians were gathered in the north of Raqqa city killing at least 18 civilians"" Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. The Britain-based group said four children were among the dead. The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters broke into Raqqa in June and has since wrested 90 percent of the city from IS. But activists say coalition strikes in support of the operation have killed hundreds of civilians and caused enormous damage. The coalitions spokesman Colonel Ryan Dillon said it does ""everything within its power to limit harm to non-combatants and civilian infrastructure."" He said ""rigorous standards"" were applied to coalition targeting and ""extraordinary efforts"" taken to avoid civilian deaths. ""The coalition conducts a detailed assessment of each and every allegation of possible civilian casualties and we will do so for this allegation as well"" he added in an email to AFP. In late September the coalition acknowledged the deaths of 735 civilians in its strikes on Syria and Iraq since 2014. But activists say the toll is much higher.

Even in the early days of the Raqqa assault residents said they feared being caught in airstrikes or shelling when they ventured to wells or the Euphrates River that runs south of the city to draw water. The Syrian conflict began when the Baath regime in power since 1963 and led by President Bashar al-Assad responded with military force to peaceful protests demanding democratic reforms during the Arab Spring wave of uprisings triggering an armed rebellion fuelled by mass defections from the Syrian army. According to independent monitors hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed in the war mostly by the regime and its powerful allies and millions have been displaced both inside and outside of Syria.

The blast in the town of Ariha in northwestern Syria went off as members of the Nusra Front gathered at the mosque for iftar the meal with which Muslims break their fast during the holy month of Ramadan. Observatory which tracks the war said the explosion in Salem Mosque in Ariha also killed a senior non-Syrian member of the Nusra Front. Opposition-based social media websites had conflicting casualty figures with some saying more than 40 people were dead. Turkeys state-run Ananolu Agency reported 15 deaths citing a statement from Istanbul-based Syrian Revolution General Commission. No group announced responsibility for the blast but supporters of Nusra Front blamed rival self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (ISIS) militants who have fought the group on several frontlines in Syria.

1923848264,Syria rebels kill 7 in Aleppo assault capture 3 villages Monitor,Syria rebels kill 7 in Aleppo assault capture 3 villages Monitor Reuters Saturday 18 Jun 2016 At least seven people died in rebel shelling of a neighbourhood of the Syrian city of Aleppo held by the Kurdish YPG militia at dawn on Saturday a monitoring group said as rebels took territory to the south. More than 40 people were also wounded in the attack on the Sheikh Maqsoud area the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a district next to the only way in and out of rebel-held parts of the northern city the Castello road. An escalation in air and artillery strikes in recent weeks around the road has made it virtually impassable putting hundreds of thousands of people in Aleppo under effective siege. Hundreds of people have been killed in Aleppo since peace talks broke off in April as Syrias President Bashar al-Assad seeks to regain control of what was Syrias largest pre-war city now split between rebel and government sectors. Rebels have said in the past their attacks on Sheikh Maqsoud were in response to YPG attempts to cut the Castello road. The YPG controls nearly all of Syrias northern frontier with Turkey and has been a close ally of the United States in the campaign against Islamic State (IS) group in Syria. Many rebels in western Syria do not trust the YPG because they say it cooperates with Damascus rather than fighting it an accusation the YPG has denied. Heavy Bombardment Sheikh Maqsoud has been under intense bombardment since mid-February which has killed more than 132 civilians and injured around 900 more the Observatory said. A 48-hour ceasefire in Aleppo announced by Russia on Thursday has had little impact on fighting and air strikes and shelling have continued in and around the city since then. Three people two of them children died and more than nine people were injured by barrel bombs dropped from helicopters in the city the Observatory said on Saturday. The White Helmets a group of civil defence emergency workers operating in rebel-held areas said on Twitter one of their buildings in Haritan in the north Aleppo countryside was hit by an air strike on Saturday. There were no injuries. The Observatory also said on Saturday that rebels had captured three villages south of Aleppo from government control - Zeitan Khalsa and Barna - causing significant losses among government forces and their allies. The villages are near a main highway within rebel territory linking Aleppo with the capital Damascus to the south. They lie in an area captured by government forces at the end of last year in a large offensive assisted by Iranian-backed militias and Russian air power. But the Syrian Observatory said there has been a lack of Russian air support during this weeks battle for these villages. At least 86 members of Syrian government forces and its allies - who include members of the Lebanese group Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed militias - were killed in fighting in the south Aleppo area in the past four days the Observatory said. The numbers could not be independently confirmed. The rebels are fighting alongside the al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front which like IS group was excluded from a February ceasefire and from the Geneva peace talks.,ahram,against,0.020527859,1.0,0.302052786,0.0,0.002932551,0.014662757,0.041055718,0.035190616,0.208922821,0

1926479318,Hundreds dead as Islamic State seizes Syrian air base: monitor Sylvia Westall,August 24 2014 Hundreds dead as Islamic State seizes Syrian air base: monitor Sylvia Westall. Islamic State militants stormed an air base in northeast Syria on Sunday capturing it from government forces after days of fighting that cost more than 500 lives a monitoring group said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 346 Islamic State fighters were killed and more than 170 members of government forces had died since Tuesday in the fight over Tabqa base making it one of the deadliest confrontations between the two groups since the start of Syrias war. The Observatory which monitors violence in Syria through sources on the ground said fighting raged inside the air base on Sunday. It was the Syrian armys last foothold in an area otherwise controlled by Islamic State which has seized large areas of Syria and Iraq. In nearby Raqqa city an Islamic State stronghold there was celebratory gunfire and several mosques announced through their loudspeakers that the base had fallen to the Islamists and cheered God is greatest a witness told Reuters. IS fighters displayed the severed heads of Syrian army soldiers in the city square the witness said adding that Syrian warplanes were heard over Raqqa following the air base attack. Earlier on Sunday the Syrian air force had bombed areas around the base. Syrian state television said that after fierce battles the military was regrouping. Citing a military source it said there was a successful evacuation of the airport and that the army was continuing strikes on terrorist groups in the area which it said had suffered heavy losses. Syrian state media gave no figure for the number of people killed in the clashes. Islamic State had also trapped around 150 retreating Syrian soldiers in an area near the base and was believed to be holding them captive the Observatory said. Residents of Tabqa city tour the streets on motorcycles carrying flags in celebration after Tabqa air base fell to Islamic State militants in nearby Raqqa city August 24 2014. REUTERS/Stringer The Syrian army sent reinforcements to the base overnight on Friday to fight Islamic State which controls roughly a third of northern and eastern Syria. Syrian television had shown footage of army forces defending the base on Saturday who had said it was safe from Islamic States advances. Many of the Islamic State fighters died after Syrian warplanes bombarded the area the Observatory said. MILITARY BASES Slideshow (3 Images) Islamic State a radical offshoot of al Qaeda has taken three Syrian military bases in the area in recent weeks boosted by arms seized in Iraq. Syria is calculating that the IS push to reshape the Middle East will eventually force the West to deal with President Bashar al-Assad as the only way to tackle the threat sources familiar with Syrian government thinking have said. Elsewhere in Syria the group withdrew from northern areas it controlled outside the city of Homs on Sunday and retreated east after coming under attack from rival Islamist fighters the Observatory said. Fighters from the group withdrew from a headquarters north of Homs on the orders of their leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi the Observatory said citing sources in the area. They said IS gave up the territory to Nusra Front al Qaedas official wing in Syria. As well as Nusra Front Western-backed rebels have also been fighting IS in Syria but have regularly been defeated by the group which in June declared an Islamic caliphate in the territory it controls. Activists have accused the Syrian army of avoiding confrontations with IS because it has weakened rival rebel groups also battling Assad.

Bashar Assads forces with assistance from Russian airstrikes is continuing its siege of opposition groups in Aleppo and is attempting to cut a road leading into the opposition-held section of the city while the groups continue to wage fierce battles despite intensified airstrikes some of which have reportedly targeted civilians. The groups had previously launched an attack against regime positions in the historic center of Aleppo on Monday in response to an offensive on Castello Road which is used for supplies and access severing opposition-held areas under siege where at least 250000 people live. Regime airstrikes killed 20 civilians on Monday in the Bab al-Maqam neighborhood of Aleppo Syria Live Network (SLN) reported. One civilian was killed and many others were injured by a regime barrel bomb dropped on al-Jalloum. Many civilians were wounded in the attacks on the al-Ansari neighborhood. Inflicting heavy casualties in the battlefield the regime also intensified its aerial artillery and missile bombardment on the neighborhoods of Bab Qensrin al-Kallaseh Bab al-Hadid and Bab al-Nasr in Aleppos old city. Eyewitnesses said that the regime used cluster bombs and vacuum bombs in the airstrikes. Elsewhere jets believed to be Russian or Syrian also struck a fuel market in a town in the northwestern province of Idlib killing 18 people and injuring scores more according to a local rescue worker near the site. An airstrike hit a local field hospital in the town of Ahsem in Idlib province killing three people including a child an international charity and an aid worker said. Early on Monday more than 300 shells fired by opposition groups hit western regime-held neighborhoods of Aleppo. The assault was ""a response to the [government] attempts to advance"" Zakaria Malahifji of the Aleppo-based Fastaqim opposition group told Reuters. He said insurgents had already made gains and that much of the fighting was taking place in Aleppos ancient old city a renowned UNESCO World Heritage site now largely in ruins. A witness reported fierce close-range clashes near the historic citadel where the opposition killed at least 20 army troops when they blew up a tunnel they dug underneath a regime post. The city Syrias largest before the war has been a main battleground in the countrys five-year war and has seen an escalation of fighting after peace talks and a fragile ceasefire broke down earlier this year. Its capture would be a strategic prize for the Assad regime which controls the major population centers in western Syria apart from opposition-held areas of Aleppo and the city of Idlib. Opposition also control pockets of territory elsewhere in western Syria. Early on Monday more than 300 shells fired by opposition groups hit western regime-held neighborhoods in Aleppo killing five people and wounding dozens more observers said. A U.N. spokeswoman said that intensified fighting between Syrian government forces and rebels in contested Aleppo has completely cut off the only road allowing access for humanitarian aid deliveries into the rebel-held part of the city. Alessandra Vellucci said on Tuesday that the Castello Road considered the only access in and out of eastern Aleppo has been rendered ""impassable"" since hostilities there worsened last week. Vellucci said the U.N. estimates that 300000 people depend on the road which allows for the flow of supplies goods and civilians into the area. She said the U.N. continues to receive ""distressing reports of aerial bombardment and shelling on civilian locations in both western and eastern Aleppo."" She called on all sides to protect civilians and ease access for humanitarian access to all.

1926479219,Factbox: Congress debates Obamas plan for Syria strikes,September 9 2013 Factbox: Congress debates Obamas plan for Syria strikes. President Barack Obamas request for congressional authorization for military strikes against Syria is set to dominate the Congress this week and next with the outcome in doubt. Obama is seeking backing for the strikes in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack near Damascus on August 21. Washington blames the Syrian government for the attack which it says kills more than 1400 people. Here are the important steps in Congress: - On Monday Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid began moving to limit debate on the motion to proceed to a resolution authorizing the use of military force. The motion to proceed is the mechanism for bringing legislation before the full Senate. It is not yet clear whether opponents will allow a simple majority vote on this procedural step or insist on a more difficult 60-vote majority in the 100-member chamber in which Obamas Democrats control 54 seats. This first test vote is now set for Wednesday. - On Monday evening many members of Congress will receive a classified briefing from administration and military officials. For scores of lawmakers this will be their first inside look at the Syria situation. - Reid in consultation with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell will likely decide how many and which amendments to the bill will be debated on the Senate floor. - Obama is due to lunch on Tuesday with Senate Democrats in an attempt to sway enough of them to support a military strike. - He then plans a speech to the nation on Tuesday night which could be a defining moment. Many undecided members of the Senate and House are likely to make up their minds on how they will vote after that speech and into Wednesday. - If the Senate votes to debate the resolution itself opponents could erect another procedural hurdle that would require 60 votes to limit this debate. Should those votes prove necessary and if Reid succeeds in rounding them up a vote on passing the Syria resolution could come on Thursday or Friday. A simple majority vote in favor of the bill would send it to the House for consideration. - The House could simply vote for or against the Senate-passed bill. Or it could amend the bill pass it and send it back to the Senate for approval. Another option though one that seems less likely now is for a House committee to write its own bill for debate in the 435-member House. In any event it could be next week before the full House takes action.

1926479310,World leaders react to Syria chemical attack claim,Wednesday 21 August 2013 World leaders react to Syria chemical attack claim. World leaders have responded to the claim by activists in the Syrian Revolution General Commission that at least 640 people were killed in a nerve gas attack on Syrias Ghouta region. The Arab League called Wednesday on U.N. chemical weapons inspectors now inside Syria to immediately visit the site of the incident. Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi urged the inspectors in a statement to go immediately to Eastern Ghouta to see the reality of the situation and investigate the circumstances of this crime. Britain said on Wednesday it would raise a reported chemical weapons attack by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad at the United Nations Security Council and called on Damascus to give U.N. inspectors access to the site Reuters reported. I am deeply concerned by reports that hundreds of people including children have been killed in airstrikes and a chemical weapons attack on rebel-held areas near Damascus British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. France also called for action by the U.N. during a cabinet session Hollande announced his intention to ask the U.N. to visit the site of the attack government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem told reporters on Wednesday. This information obviously requires verification and confirmation she added. The chief of a U.N. inspectors team visiting Syria says he wants to look into the claims. Swedish chemical weapons expert Ake Sellstrom says the high numbers of killed and wounded being reported sound suspicious. He told Swedish broadcaster SVT that this sounds like something we need to look into. Turkey also called on U.N. inspectors to look into Syrian rebel reports and said it was monitoring the situation with great concern. Light must immediately be shed on these claims and the United Nations mission that was formed to investigate chemical weapons claims in Syria should look into these claims and reveal its findings the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. If these allegations are found to be true it will be inevitable for the international community to take the necessary stance and give the necessary response to this savagery and crime against humanity it said. The opposition Syrian National Coalition called for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting on the subject. I call on the Security Council to convene urgently National Coalition leader Ahmed al-Jarba told Al-Arabiya news channel condemning the Syrian armys bombardment of the Ghouta suburbs of Damascus as a massacre. The attack was on rebel-held areas of eastern Damascus. Regime forces ... stepped up military operations in the Eastern Ghouta and Western Ghouta zones of the Damascus region with aircraft and rocket launchers causing several dozen dead and wounded the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told AFP news agency. The intensive bombing on the outskirts of the capital could be heard by residents of Damascus where a grey cloud capped the sky. The Britain-based Observatory which relies on a vast network of activists on the ground and medics said the army operation was aimed at the recapture of Madhamiyat el-Sham an area southwest of Damascus. The Local Coordination Committees (LCC) a network of activists reported hundreds of casualties in the brutal use of toxic gas by the criminal regime in parts of Western Ghouta. According to Reuters the reported use of the chemical agents could not be immediately verified.

1923102830,US-led coalition raids kill scores of civilians in Syria,Date of publication 18 July 2016 Syrian activist groups say airstrikes by the US-led coalition targeting areas controlled by the Islamic State group have killed at least 21 civilians. Airstrikes by the US-led coalition killed at least 21 civilians in and around a stronghold of the Islamic State group in northern Syria on Monday. At least 15 civilians were killed in raids in a northern district of Manbij while six others were killed in a village near the city according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The extremist bastion has faced more than a month-long US-backed offensive by Kurdish and Arab fighters that has caused thousands of civilians to flee. However tens of thousands of civilians are still trapped in Manbij most of which is controlled by the extremists. On June 23 the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters broke into western districts of Manbij after blocking the road south of the city heading to ISs de facto capital of Raqqa. But their advance has been slowed in the past month because of landmines planted by the militants which are also fighting back by launching suicide attacks against the SDF. Founded in October the Kurdish-dominated alliance has seized territory from IS across large parts of northern and northeastern Syria. Capturing Manbij would be its most significant victory yet. Syrias war has killed more than 280000 people and displaced millions since it started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.

A mosque was also destroyed by regime airstrikes north of Hama in the west-central region of the country local civil defense sources said Friday. A civil defense official in Idlib Leys el-Faris told Anadolu Agency four civilians were killed and seven others injured in an airstrike which hit the Sermin district. According to Faris a number of residential areas were destroyed in the attack. The Abu Ubaidah Ibn al-Jarrah mosque north of Hama city in Kafr Zeita was also destroyed by Russian airstrikes. ""The regime is intensively attacking rural areas in Idlib and Hama with its allies"" Faris said. Videos and images of the destroyed mosque have been circulating online. Speaking to Anadolu Agency Yusuf el-Bustani a local activist said regime forces were attacking the opposition-controlled Qaboun neighborhood of the capital Damascus. Bustani said four civilians had been injured in the attack. He added local people had difficulties in meeting basic needs due to regime forces attack in East Ghouta. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity. Several rounds of peace talks - in Geneva and the Kazakh capital Astana - have so far failed to end the conflict in which hundreds of thousands of Syrian civilians are believed to have been killed to date. The namesake of the destroyed mosque Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah was one of the companions of the prophet Muhammad and converted to Islam in 611. Like many of the early Muslims of Mecca Abu Ubaidah experienced hardships because of his faith and migrated to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) with a delegation at Muhammads suggestion. Abu Ubaidah joined Muhammad when the prophet migrated from Mecca to Medina in 622. During his life he was a military commander in the Muslim-Quraysh Wars and during the Rashidun conquest of the Levant.

Activists said regime forces bombed the town of Saraqib in rural Idlib with chlorine-filled barrel bombs on Monday causing over 30 cases of asphyxiation among civilians. The attacks were carried out in a blatant violation of UN Security Council resolutions 2118 and 2235 banning the use of chemical weapons and toxic substances. In a press release issued earlier on Tuesday the Syrian Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to shoulder its responsibilities towards stopping such attacks. It stressed that urgent measures must be taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations to protect the Syrian people. Any further delay in taking firm stance towards such attacks will open the door to more crimes and violations by the Assad regime the Coalition said. Separately over 12 civilians were killed and dozens injured including women and children when Russian jets raided the village of Abu Alduhour in rural Idlib on Monday. Five civilians were also killed in similar attacks on the village of Tal Toughan in rural Idlib. Activists said that the bombings were carried out by Russian forces in revenge for the death of five crewmen killed when their helicopter crashed near the town of Saraqib on Monday. The Syrian Coalition emphasized the need for the international community to assume its responsibilities regarding the protection of civilians in accordance with International Law (IL) and International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to stop war crimes and eliminate the constant threat of the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime.

1924058196,14 killed in suicide attack on Syria wedding,Published October 3 2016 At least 14 people were killed 25 were wounded in suicide attack on a wedding in Hasakah northern Syria late Monday. A police source in the city said the initial toll also included 55 injured. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 14 were killed in the blast adding the number was expected to rise with many of the wounded in critical condition. The city is mainly in the hands of the PKKs Syrian wing the YPG after it evicted the Syrian regime army last August and leaving them with a symbolic foothold in a security zone in the center of the city. The YPG have expanded their control of the city despite the bombing of several locations by Syrian jets. Thousands of civilians in the ethnically mixed city including members of the Christian community have fled to villages in the countryside as the fighting intensified. Hasakahs population swelled by displaced Syrians fleeing areas that fell under Daish control is broadly divided along ethnic lines with Kurds mainly in the citys eastern neighborhoods and Arabs in the southern parts. Ankara has frequently voiced its concern over YPG activity along the Turkish border and has been rigid in its stance to not allow the PYD militant group to found any de facto Kurdish state in northern Syria.

1926479276,Syrian Islamist insurgents launch battle to seize government-held Aleppo,July 2 2015 Syrian Islamist insurgents launch battle to seize government-held Aleppo. Syrian insurgents led by Islamist groups began a major offensive to gain full control of the divided northern city of Aleppo a monitor and rebels said on Thursday. The fall of Syrias main commercial hub would be a major blow for President Bashar al-Assad restricting his control mainly to a belt of territory stretching north from Damascus to the Mediterranean coast. This would deepen Syrias de facto partition between the Assad-run west and areas held by a patchwork of armed groups. A statement by the groups said their goal was to liberate the city of Aleppo and to ensure that when it fell into their hands it would be ruled by strict sharia principles. The British-based Observatory for Human Rights said a coalition of groups that included al Qaedas Syrian offshoot Nusra Front and Salafi Ahrar al Sham had fired hundreds of mortar bombs on locations in western districts of the city that are held by the Syrian army and allied militias. Much of the fighting was focused on the Jamiyat al-Zahra frontline where the insurgents struck the heavily defended part of the district held by the army according to Rami Abdul Rahman the head of the rights group which tracks the war. The Jamiyat al Zahra which houses several major security compounds has long been coveted by the rebels to allow them to advance into government-held areas and cut army supply lines. The latest flareup of fighting was the widest rebel offensive taking place simultaneously across most front lines since the insurgents took over most of the eastern part of the city in the summer of 2012 Abdul Rahman added. Eight civilians were killed with at least 70 injured with dozens of dead and injured from army personnel and allied militias the head of the monitor said. The Syrian army last month repelled a push by an alliance of rebels including recipients of Western aid fighting under the name of the Free Syrian Army into Aleppos Rashidin district. It was the first rebel advance into the heart of Aleppos government-controlled residential area in more than two years. Insurgents have also been bombarding government-held areas turning the tables after strikes by Syrian forces on insurgent-held parts of what was Syrias most populous city before it become a main battleground in the four-year civil war. Separately the sound of intense fighting including explosions could be heard from the Turkish border town of Kilis about 30 miles (48 km) north of the Syrian city of Azaz witnesses said. The Turkish army stepped up security on their side of the border including armored regiments and special forces following days of deploying troops and equipment to the area security sources said. The sources said the fighting in Azaz was between hardline Islamic State militants and a joint force of al-Nusra and Western-backed rebels who have clashing in northern Aleppo countryside in recent weeks.

1918150027,Bus Bombing Marks End to Tragic Evacuation Deal in Syria,April 18 2017 Bus Bombing Marks End to Tragic Evacuation Deal in Syria. For two Syrian mothers on opposite sides of a two-year siege their evacuation from the blockade was supposed to end their suffering but that was not the case in wake of a bombing outside the city of Aleppo. Noha a Shiite and Samira a Sunni were besieged for nearly two years on each side of Syrias civil war. At the weekend they finally escaped the suffocating blockades under an evacuation agreement but their ordeal was not over. As they waited at two transit points miles apart outside Aleppo a bomb attack hit Nohas bus convoy killing more than 120 people including dozens of children. After ambulances rushed off the wounded new buses arrived and the two convoys eventually reached their destinations one in regime territory and the other in rebel territory. In the hours leading up to Saturdays attacks the two women spoke to Reuters about what they had left behind their families being split up and the likelihood they would never return home. Reuters was not allowed back past security to try to find Noha after the blast and lost contact with Samira after speaking to her earlier on another evacuees phone. Weve lost everything. We hope to go back one day but I dont expect we wil said Noha 45 asking not to be identified by her last name. Noha left al-Foua one of two Shiite villages besieged by Syrian insurgents in Idlib province with her two youngest children and 5000 other people under a deal between the Syrian regime and armed opposition. In exchange 2000 Sunni residents and rebel fighters from the regime-besieged town of Madaya near Damascus Samiras hometown were given safe passage out and bussed to Idlib province a rebel stronghold via Aleppo. Thousands of Syrians have been evacuated from besieged areas in recent months under deals between Bashar al-Assads regime and rebels fighting for six years to unseat him. Rebels say it amounts to forced displacement of Assads opponents from Syrias main urban centers in the west of the country and engenders demographic change because most of the opposition and Syrias population are Sunni. There was little choice. We had to leave we were scared said Samira 55 who was traveling with her five adult sons. She had feared her sons would be arrested or forced to join the Syrian regime forces and fight once troops and officials of the Damascus regime moved into the town. Like Noha Samira was relieved to have escaped a crushing siege which had caused widespread hunger and in the case of Madaya starvation but had left everything behind including family. We owned three houses farmland and three shops in Madaya town. Now we dont have a single Syrian pound she said. Her daughter pregnant with a third child had stayed in Madaya because her husband had vowed to live and die there she said. Samira has not heard from her own husband for nearly four years after he was arrested by the regime. With nothing left and no place to stay in Idlib other than camps Samira said she would try to migrate joining the 5 million Syrian refugees who have left since the war broke out in 2011. More than 6 million are internally displaced. I dont want to be in Idlib we know no one there. Also you dont know when or where the jets might bomb she said referring to the heavy bombardment by Russian and Syrian warplanes of rebel-held areas in Idlib including a recent alleged poison gas attack. The plan is to try to get to Turkey to leave Syria for good. Noha was also heading into the unknown. I dont know where well live whether they (authorities) have anything set up. At the very least we just want to be safe. The children jump at night from the sound of rockets. We just want security wherever they take us she said. Her adult son and daughter had stayed in al-Foua but were hoping to leave in the next stage of the evacuation deal. Nohas husband had been killed but she did not say how. Both women said they would never have left their hometowns but for the strangling sieges which caused severe food and medicine shortages and the gradual change of control in each area. On Saturday a deadly explosion killed at least 100 including children regime supporters and opposition fighters at an evacuation point adding new urgency to the widely criticized operation. The blast ripped through a bus depot in the al-Rashideen area where thousands of regime loyalists evacuated the day before waited restlessly for hours as opposition fighters guarded the area while negotiators bickered over the completion of the transfer deal. Only meters away hundreds of evacuees from pro-rebels areas also loitered in a walled-off parking lot guarded by regime troops.

Hamza al-Khatib the director of a hospital in the rebel-held east told Reuters the death toll from the strikes was 45. The strikes come after Russia and the Syrian regime rejected a US plea to halt flights burying any hope for the revival of the ceasefire. Opposition officials and rescue workers said incendiary bombs were among the weapons used on the city. ""Its as if the planes are trying to compensate for all the days they didnt drop bombs during the ceasefire"" Ammar al-Selmo the head of the Civil Defense rescue service in opposition-held eastern Aleppo told Reuters. A man runs with a stretcher at a damaged site after air strikes on the opposition-held al-Qaterji neighbourhood of Aleppo Syria September 21 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) ""It was like there was coordination between the planes and the artillery shelling because the shells were hitting the same locations that the planes hit"" he said. The assault by aircraft from the Syrian regime its Russian allies or both made it clear that Moscow and Damascus had rejected a plea by US Secretary of State John Kerry to halt flights so that aid could be delivered and a ceasefire salvaged. There was no immediate comment from the Syrian regime or mention on regime-run media of Thursdays bombardment. ""It was the heaviest air strikes for months inside Aleppo city"" said Rami Abdulrahman director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which monitors the conflict from Britain. Homs evacuation Assad has appeared as uncompromising as ever in recent weeks reiterating his goal of taking back the whole country on the day the US-Russian brokered truce took effect. The regimes main focus has been to consolidate its grip over the main cities of western Syria and the coastal region that is the ancestral homeland of Assads Alawite sect. On Thursday around 120 opposition fighters and their families were evacuated from the last opposition-held district of Homs under an agreement with the regime by which they were given safe passage to nearby opposition-held areas. Families carry their luggage into a bus to evacuate the besieged district of Waer in the central Syrian city of Homs after a local agreement reached between opposition forces and Syrian regime military forces September 22 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) The opposition says such agreements are part of a regime strategy to forcibly displace populations from opposition-held areas after years of siege and bombardment. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimates several thousand opposition fighters remain in the al-Waer district.

""We are sending today an inter-agency convoy that will cross conflict lines into a besieged area of rural Damascus"" Jens Laerke spokesman for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) told Reuters. ""We will advise on the exact locations once the convoy has actually reached those locations.""

Assad cast doubt on the intentions of the United States in Syria saying it ""doesnt have the will"" to fight militants.

Seven militants from Syrias Al-Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front terrorist group including commanders were killed in US-led air strikes Wednesday in the northwest of the conflict-riven country a Britain-based opposition monitoring group said. The US-led raids in Syria which began last September have allegedly focused on the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) takfiri group but Al-Nusra Front terrorist organization has also been the target of some strikes. ""Seven Al-Nusra members including commanders were killed in at least five coalition air strikes against the groups bases and a vehicle in Idleb province"" the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Rami Abdel Rahman said. Most of Idleb province has been under the control of Al-Nusra and its terrorist allies. The United States is backing more moderate rebels in their fight against the Syrian regime. Like ISIL Al-Nusra is blacklisted as a ""terrorist organization"" by Washington. Syria was hit by a violent unrest since mid-March 2011 where the western media reports accuse countries mainly the USA Turkey Saudi Arabia and Qatar of orchestrating the civil conflict in the country and providing terrorist groups with money weapons and trained mercenaries. On May 2011 Syrian army launched a wide-scale operation against armed groups and gunmen operating in the country who started to escape the army blows and infiltrate illegally to Lebanon.

1918398776,Syrian army advances near Aleppo,"Published February 18 2015 The Syrian army backed by allied militia has captured several villages north of Aleppo from insurgents and fighting has blocked a main supply route leading into the northern city a monitoring group said on Tuesday. A U.N. mediator has been struggling to broker a ceasefire in Aleppo and government forces had long been expected to try to encircle it completely aiming to drive insurgents from Syrias second city and take control of their main supply road. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said pro-government forces had blocked a road leading towards the Turkish border as heavy clashes continued there. The army also took villages including Bashkuwi and Sifat while battles raged in Hardatain and Ratain said the Observatory which tracks the Syrian conflict using sources on the ground. It added that at least 16 insurgents were killed. Aleppo is at the heart of clashes between pro-government forces and a range of insurgents which include extremist brigades al Qaedas hardline Syria wing Nusra Front foreign fighters in other groups and Western-backed rebels. ""It is very important because if they continue like this they will completely cut the supply lines for the future. The Syrian regime is moving forward there"" the Observatorys founder Rami Abdulrahman said. More than 210000 people have died in the Syrian conflict which will enter its fifth year next month the Observatory has estimated with fighting between numerous factions regularly flaring across the country. Villages and towns outside Aleppo have passed between pro-government and insurgent fighters before. Insurgent-held districts in the divided city have come under heavy air force bombardment while Syrian state television said on Tuesday that five people had been killed and 18 wounded in ""terrorist"" rocket attacks in Aleppo neighborhoods. A television channel run by Lebanese group Hezbollah which is fighting alongside pro-government units reported that the Syrian army had taken control of areas north of Aleppo. The Observatory said Hezbollah was involved in the battle. The pro-government al-Watan newspaper said on Monday that government forces aimed to completely surround the city this week in a major offensive against insurgent groups. In December mainly extremist insurgent factions in Aleppo grouped together to form Jabhat al-Shamiyya the Levant Front an attempt at unity among their fighters. Last month the Western-backed rebel group Hazzm movement joined the alliance after coming under pressure from Nusra Front. Recent Syrian army progress in the area has reduced the chances of a truce between the government and disparate insurgent groups diplomats say.

The crudely constructed weapons were used on Al Bab which lies in Aleppo province and is held by the extremist Daesj group according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Since Saturday at least 68 civilians have been killed in aerial attacks on the town. Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said the ""intensified air attacks by regime forces on Al Bab are aimed at foiling Daesh efforts on multiple fronts"" including the nearby Kweyris military airport which Daesh has besieged for more than a year. Al Bab is strategically important because it is one of Daeshs closest positions to regime-held parts of Aleppo he told AFP. In May more than 60 civilians were killed by barrel bomb attacks on the town. Syrias embattled regime has heavily bombarded areas in Aleppo province that have fallen out of its control. To the west in Idlib province an alliance of rebels and Islamist fighters heavily shelled the provinces last two regime-held Shiite villages for the second consecutive day.

1962495733,Death toll in bomb attack on Syria evacuees rises to 112,"Sun Apr 16 2017 Death toll in bomb attack on Syria evacuees rises to 112. Many residents of Fuaa and Kafraya lost their lives after terrorists attacked their buses. Afp - The death toll in a suicide car bomb attack on buses carrying Syrians evacuated from two besieged government-held towns has risen to at least 112 a monitoring group said Sunday. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that 98 evacuees from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya were killed when an explosives-laden vehicle hit their buses at a transit point west of Aleppo on Saturday. It said the remainder of the dead were aid workers and rebels tasked with guarding the buses. It warned the death toll may rise further as ""hundreds"" more were wounded in the blast. Dozens of buses carrying several thousand refugees had been stuck by the roadside in the rebel-held town of Rashidin after leaving Fuaa and Kafraya on Friday under a deal reached between the government and opposition groups. More than 30000 people are set for evacuation under the deal brokered by rebel backer Qatar and regime ally Iran. Fuaa and Kafraya have been under rebel siege for more than two years. As part of the deal several hundred people including armed rebels will be transported out of Madaya and Zabadani towns near Damascus which are surrounded by pro-government forces. Syrias six-year civil war has seen several similar deals which the government of President Bashar al-Assad says are the best way to end the violence. Rebels say they are being forced to relocate through bombardment and seige. The government blamed Saturdays attack on ""terrorists."" The blast puts the four-town evacuation deal brokered partly by rebel backer Qatar and government ally Iran in doubt. The Observatory said after the bombing that the evacuation process had resumed but it was not immediately clear on Sunday if convoys had restarted their journeys.",alalam,pro,0.009756098000000001,1.0,0.331707317,0.004878049000000001,0.0,0.009756098000000001,0.053658537,0.034146341000000004,0.243971183,1
